They beat the previous record set by Paris Saint Germain in 2000 when they beat Rosenborg 7-2. \nBut let's not forget, Deportivo were no slouches themselves, with Juan Carlos Valeron, Diego Tristan and Mauro Silva all involved. \nHere are both XI's: Deportivo La Coruna: \nWhat a game. \nHere are the highlights from that incredible night in Monaco as Dado Prso celebrated his birthday in style:   Jack Kenmare Back in 1998, Nicky Butt's typically wayward strike hit me right in the head.

    "text": "Geert Wilders brands Dutch hate speech trial 'a charade' 23 November 2016 Image copyright EPA Image caption Geert Wilders: \"I am not a racist and my supporters are not racists\" Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders has told a court that his trial for alleged hate speech is a \"charade, a disgrace for the Netherlands, a mockery for our society\". \nIn a televised statement on the last day of the trial, he said that if he was convicted \"millions of Dutch citizens will be convicted with me\". \nThe charges were brought after he led a chant for fewer Moroccans in the Netherlands at a rally 18 months ago. \nHe denies inciting racial hatred. \nMr Wilders has denounced the trial as an attempt to suppress freedom of speech. If convicted, he faces a fine and a year in prison. The verdict is due next month. \nThe populist politician, who had previously refused to attend the trial, addressed a three-judge bench at a high-security courthouse near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. \nIn a long speech, he portrayed himself as part of a growing anti-establishment movement that had resulted in the UK's vote to leave the European Union and Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. \n\"Worldwide, a movement has started that is making short shrift of the politically correct doctrines of the elite and their subordinate media,\" he said. \n\"Brexit proved it. The American election proved it.\" \nHe said that neither he nor his supporters were racist. Image copyright AP Image caption The trial is being held in a high-security court near Schiphol airport \n\"They are people who want their country back and who are sick and tired of not being listened to,\" he said. \n\"If you convict me you will convict half of the Netherlands. Many Dutch will then lose the last bit of trust in the rule of law.\" \nMr Wilders has repeatedly criticised Islam, calling for the Koran to be banned and for the closure of all mosques in the Netherlands. \nBut prosecutors say he crossed a line when he asked supporters if they wanted \"fewer or more Moroccans\" in the Netherlands. \nAfter supporters chanted back \"fewer\", he replied: \"We'll organise that.\" \nIn 2011, Mr Wilders was acquitted of incitement after being accused of encouraging hatred towards Muslims. \nThe Netherlands will hold a general election in March and some opinion polls suggest Mr Wilders' Freedom Party (PVV) is a close second behind Prime Minister Mark Rutte's liberal VVD, or even slightly ahead.

    "text": "Email Larsen & Talbert \nTen years after Kate Gosselin decided to take her family on the journey that is reality TV, the Kate Plus 8 star is now looking ahead – ten years ahead! \n“I’ll be the crazy cat lady … except with dogs,” Gosselin, 41, tells PEOPLE. “I’ve learned not to have any predictions about the next 10 years, because I certainly never thought I’d have wound up here 10 years ago! Given all the drama of our lives, doing a reality show honestly feels like the smallest issue we’ve ever had to deal with.” \nAdding, “I feel honored that people are invested in the lives of my children, and in what their future might hold. I feel honored that we’ve been treated by our viewers like family, and so if they want to see my future family with random dogs and birds and lots of visits to random colleges, I’m happy to do it!” \nIn 2006, Gosselin and her then-husband Jon opened up their home to give viewers a glimpse of what life was like raising 5-year-old twins Mady and Cara and 16-month-old sextuplets Aaden, Alexis, Collin, Hannah, Leah and Joel. \nLooking back, Gosselin doesn’t have any regrets, except for one. \n“If I could go back, I wouldn’t spend so much time worrying about the messes and the obsessive compulsiveness and needing to be so in control,” she previously told PEOPLE . “I would spend more time nibbling little feet and cuddling up. I worried about so many things I just didn’t need to be worrying about when they were still so young, and I came on way too strong. I should have just rolled around on the floor some. I wouldn’t have melted down as much.” \nKate Plus 8 returns Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET on TLC. Show Full Article",

    "text": "Rodney Culleton’s alleged attempt to influence a Queensland magistrate involved a case against a bankrupt former legal advocate whose supporters include an adviser to the One Nation senator.\nCulleton has been referred to police over a letter asking the magistrate to adjourn the case against David John Walter from Herberton in northern Queensland, who is charged with failing to provide information about his financial affairs during bankruptcy.\nThe letter – which also refers to Culleton having “foreshadowed” a Senate motion “to recall a number of judges for ‘proven misbehaviour” – could amount to threatening a judicial officer and trying to pervert the course of justice, according to Queensland’s chief magistrate.\n\nRodney Culleton referred to Queensland police over 'threatening' letter to magistrate Read more \nThe case against Walter, a retired police officer, follows a long-running saga related to his work as an unorthodox, unqualified legal advocate challenging legislation in Queensland courts on behalf of others.\nThe commonwealth charge against Walter was first heard by the Cairns magistrate last month after he was bankrupted over a legal costs order arising from his advice to people in disputes with three local councils that they should not pay rates.\nWalter’s supporters include Peter Gargan, who has been advising Culleton before a looming Senate referral for a high court examination of the senator’s eligibility for election.\nWalter was barred from legally representing others in Queensland in 2011 after acting in at least 10 cases where a judge said he ran the same “peculiar” but futile line of legal argument challenging state and local authorities over legislation including tree-clearing controls.\nHe argued unsuccessfully during bankruptcy proceedings that legislation passed in Australia since 1966 is unconstitutional because it has been signed by governor generals who were paid in dollars, not pounds as specified by the constitution.\n\nGargan argued the same point to press the former officer’s case in a letter to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, in April.\nHe urged Turnbull to call a “referendum to normalise the currency” as “no legislation since 1966 has been legitimately approved by any governor general because none of them have been paid in legitimate currency”.\nGargan also wrote to a lawyer involved in bankruptcy proceedings against the Herberton man to upbraid him for not engaging with issues he was raising, including “currency fraud”.\nGargan earlier this month spoke to Crikey from Culleton’s Perth office, where he reportedly “cheerfully” acknowledged that he had been declared a “vexatious litigant” by courts in four states, including Queensland.\nIn an email to a lawyer seen by Guardian Australia, Gargan wrote: “While you lawyer rubbish refuse to admit people like me to the Profession of Ali Baba and probably the forty thousand thieves, I have still done the hard yards at university.\n“If some of you mongrels were any good, the issues David Walter is raising like sovereign debt and currency fraud, banking welfare, and blatant disregard of the laws of the commonwealth because only you shitbags or one of the forty thousand thieves can prosecute for breaches, would be addressed.”\nA proponent of arcane arguments challenging the legitimacy of Australian courts through a literal interpretation of the constitution, Gargan’s engagement by Culleton coincided with the senator raising questions about the authority of the high court.\nIn his first question in the Senate, Culleton referred to the high court’s supposed failure to issue writs in the name of the Queen. On 7 November, he wrote to the Senate president accusing the high court of procedural failings that made it unlawful and asked that the upper house consider removing “offending judges” from office. \nPauline Hanson rails against 'reverse racism' as Senate debates free speech – politics live Read more \nThe letter to the Queensland magistrate, dated 15 November and bearing Culleton’s Senate letterhead, said: “We are watching with interest the conduct of all judicial officers Australia wide, after discovering the high court has not been conducting its business in the name of the Queen.\n“If so this could reflect on all jurisdictions. As a safeguard against a possible injustice, could I respectfully ask that you adjourn the matter until the constitutional position of all courts is clarified.”\nThe revelation of letter this week signalled a growing rift between the One Nation senator and party leader Pauline Hanson .\n\nCulleton has since written to the magistrate “to clarify and emphasise that there was no disrespect ... to the court, or to judicial procedure”.\nHe has said he “totally rejects any suggestion of threats to any officer of any court, or any attempt to pervert the course of justice”.\nThe initial letter was written “in the interest of justice” on behalf of a distressed individual, Culleton said.\nWalter, who is being prosecuted by the commonwealth director of public prosecutions, had his property sold by bankruptcy trustees in June after they sought a warrant for his eviction.\nHowever, it is understood Walter remains at the property with the support of its new owner, a farmer who unsuccessfully challenged the authority of state laws to fight a fine for clearing trees on his Brisbane property.\nWalter’s bankruptcy followed a rare legal costs order awarded to councils to compensate their expenses in recovering almost $200,000 in unpaid rates. Walter is understood to have paid his own rates, was held liable by the court because he acted as a legal adviser to the dissident ratepayers.\nIn 2011, Queensland’s legal services commission won an injunction preventingWalter, who was not a qualified Australian legal practitioner, from acting as a legal representative. \nThe supreme court found he repeatedly ran cases using the same “fundamentally misconceived” legal arguments to challenge legislation. \nIn one case he acted for a north Queensland landowner who wanted to clear trees on a property known to contain habitat for endangered mahogany gliders and cassowaries.\n\nPauline Hanson reasserts control of One Nation after chaotic day Read more \nThe supreme court found he was using “ other parties effectively as stalking horses to enable him to continually repeat these contentions”.\nWalter had for years been “very persistent in presenting those arguments in court” in person, despite knowing “he had repeatedly failed to persuade judges and magistrates that the decision was wrong”, the court found.\nWalter is due to appear again on 24 January in the Cairns magistrates court, formally charged with refusing or failing to provide information in compliance with a notice.\nBankrupted in 2014, Walter filed a statement of affairs on 4 July, according to a search of bankruptcy records with the Australian Financial Security Authority.",

    "text": "Story highlights Beijing bakery employs disabled adults with bone diseases Bakery was founded by Grace Yang, who cannot walk due to contracting polio as a child (CNN) Thanksgiving isn't officially celebrated in China, but a small bakery in a Beijing suburb is filled with the aroma of this traditional American holiday.\nAt Bread of Life Bakery , Grace Yang and her colleagues are racing against the clock to fill orders for more than 300 Western-style pies to be delivered to homes across Beijing in time for Thanksgiving celebrations. Their customers are mostly US expatriates living in the Chinese capital. The 29-year-old baker was born in China's Shaanxi province, to a family she barely remembers. China's abandoned children Read More Yang cannot walk due to polio as an infant. She was abandoned by her parents at the age of four, and grew up in a state-owned orphanage. Yang's childhood tragedy is not unique in China. Almost all of China's abandoned children have disabilities. Despite the country's rapid economic growth, welfare experts say China lacks an adequate social safety net . Many parents simply cannot afford medical care for their disabled children. MORE: 'They don't deserve this kind of life:' Meet China's abandoned children Preparing for the Thanksgiving rush on baked goods. Most abandoned children with disabilities have no job prospects or future to look forward to -- a harsh reality in China that motivated American couple Keith and Cheryl Wyse to start the charity bakery Bread of Life back in 2008. The bakery trains and employs disabled adults with bone diseases, all of whom were orphaned as children. Through an introduction, Yang joined in 2011 as full-time staff, and learned to make bread and pies from scratch. She had no knowledge of western baking when she joined. 'I started to love baking' \"At the beginning it was difficult for me, especially when it comes to the measurements of ingredients -- something I've never dealt with before,\" Yang tells CNN. \"But gradually I started to love baking.\" At Thanksgiving, Grace thinks she's most grateful to Bread of Life for giving her her very first job. \"Before coming here, I was lost and confused, I didn't know what to expect for the future. In the bakery, I learned to be independent.\" Looking ahead, Yang hopes to one day start her own bakery and start a family. \"I grew up without parents, so I want to give my future children the love I never had.\"",

    "text": "Syrian Refugee Transitions From Child Bride to Sole Provider By karin laub, associated press BEIRUT  Nov 22, 2016, 1:08 AM ET 0 Shares Star The Associated Press In this Friday, Oct. 28, 2016 photo, Syrian refugee Haela Kalawi, 31, second left, and fellow Syrian refugees sit around a table surrounded by the garbage while listening to their teacher during an English language class at Recycle Beirut in Ouzai, a south Beirut slum, Lebanon. About one-third of 240,000 Syrian refugee households in Lebanon are headed by women, in stark contrast to Syria's traditions which see men as providers and protectors. The husbands of the women surviving on their own are either dead, missing, chose to remain in Syria or tried to make their way to Europe. (AP Photo/Bilal Hussein) 0 Shares Email For the first few weeks of her job recycling garbage, Haela Kalawi often went home crying. It wasn't just the grungy setting — a dimly lit, airless basement where the 31-year-old refugee with a cherubic face slips on plastic gloves and digs into trash-filled containers. It was that as a traditional housewife in Syria, Kalawi grew up believing it was shameful for women to work outside the house. In those days, she wasn't even allowed to shop for her own clothes or choose what to watch on TV. Now, in a slum in Beirut, Lebanon, Kalawi is the breadwinner for the family's four children. She has to be -- her husband went missing in the civil war back home three years ago. While she still misses her old comfortable life, she has discovered a fortitude she didn't know she had and discarded traditional notions of what a woman should be. \"I tell my children I'm the man of the family,\" Kalawi says, sitting on one of the gray mattresses spread on the floor of the family's small rented room. \"I am the father and the mother. I'm the one who works. I'm the one who buys vegetables. I'm the one who takes them out, and brings them what they need.\" EDITOR'S NOTE: This story is part of a series of profiles of Arab women who are agents of change in different countries and areas of life. Across the world, women often bear the brunt of wars, especially those fought in populated areas with high rates of civilian casualties and displacement — as has been the case in the Middle East . Syria's conflict has uprooted half the country's population, including many women. In Lebanon, about one-third of 240,000 Syrian refugee households are headed by women whose husbands — traditionally the providers and protectors — are dead, missing or chose to stay behind. In exile, some of these women feel vulnerable to harassment and violence, leaving their homes less than they did in Syria, according to a 2014 study by the U.N. refugee agency. However, others, like Kalawi, have become accidental agents of change in a region where it is still relatively rare for women to be leaders in the family. \"The great wars in Europe significantly contributed to the recognition of the woman in society,\" said Killian Kleinschmidt, who used to run Jordan's largest camp for Syrian refugees . \"And so there is hope that amongst the evil, at least the society in the Middle East will gain, changing the role and importance of women.\" ——— Kalawi grew up with a sister and three brothers in Eastern Ghouta, a densely populated, predominantly Sunni Muslim suburb of the Syrian capital of Damascus. Girls in the conservative community tended to marry young. By the time Kalawi — pretty with pale eyes — was 15, she had already turned down several proposals. But when another stranger, 28-year-old Mohammed Dahla, asked to marry her, she agreed. They wed two months later. \"When I saw him, I liked him,\" she said of her future husband. She dropped out of the 10th grade, even though her husband, a lawyer, wanted her to continue. The following school year, he re-enrolled his young wife and bought the needed books, but she got pregnant and stayed home instead. She loved motherhood, but soon regretted having married so young. Her husband, feeling she neglected him for the children, became distant, spending evenings watching sports and the news on TV. \"We wouldn't do many activities together. He wasn't rude, he was very good to me, but he was not the same,\" she says. Her husband had absolute say in the family. She spent her days cooking, cleaning and going over homework with her older children. She rarely left the apartment, except on Fridays, a weekend day for Muslims, when the family would go on picnics or visit relatives. Kalawi's sheltered existence ended with the civil war between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad and the rebels trying to topple him. Eastern Ghouta, a rebel stronghold, was hit by heavy shelling. In August 2013, Kalawi's uncle, his wife and their adult son were killed in an attack with rockets containing the chemical agent sarin. Two cousins were later killed in rocket and mortar strikes. The couple decided to flee. Kalawi and the children moved to her grandparents' home in Damascus, and her husband was to follow once he'd sold the car and other belongings. Instead, he disappeared, a fate shared by thousands snatched from homes and streets by combatants on both sides. The first months without him were rough. \"I would cry every day for him,\" she recalls. \"He was my anchor. When he was missing, I felt I have no one, I can go nowhere, I can do nothing. I felt like an intruder at my grandparents' house.\" ——— Kalawi stayed in Syria for another year and a half to keep the children in school. But when the fighting escalated, the family fled to Lebanon in May 2015. There, she joined her widowed mother Wujdan Ghazal, her divorced aunt Razan Ghazal, and Razan's 20-year-old daughter Aisheh, whose husband has been missing since he was seized by Syrian intelligence four years ago. The women, with 10 children among them, live in small rooms with three separate entrances, arranged around the dead end of an alley in Ouzai, a run-down neighborhood of Beirut. Razan, 40, was the first of the women to move to Ouzai, after shelling destroyed her apartment in Syria four years ago. She's the brash one, the go-getter in the family. She says that's because she's had more experience as the breadwinner; her husband walked out 15 years ago, leaving her to provide for four children. Even Razan was taken aback when she first walked into Recycle Beirut, a company that collects glass, plastic and other materials from about 800 customers and stores it underground in Ouzai. But Razan needed work, and at $120 for a 36-hour week, the pay was higher than what she could make in other unskilled jobs. Owner Kassem Kazad, a descendant of Palestinian refugees who was sympathetic to the displaced Syrians, asked her to recruit five more women. Razan says her niece was the most reluctant among her female relatives and initially refused to work, despite repeated appeals. Back in Syria, Kalawi would criticize her mother for accepting occasional jobs sewing bridal gowns. The mother argued at the time that creating gowns was more of a hobby than a job, but her daughter felt strongly that women shouldn't work, even for fun. \"I was surprised that my daughter accepted to work,\" says Wujdan, 50, who makes $400 a month sewing mattress covers in a nearby shop. Kalawi says the reason for her change of heart was simple. \"I needed money,\" she says. \"I hated to ask my mother for money.\" She works six days a week. Her first paycheck was a cause for celebration, and she took her children to a seaside restaurant and an amusement park to mark the occasion. In Ouzai, Kalawi shares a single room with a daughter and three sons, ranging in age from four to 14. They sleep on mattresses on the floor that convert to sitting cushions during the day. Clothes are stacked behind the weather-beaten dark red entrance door, with tissue stuffed into cracks in the splintered wood. A tiny window near the ceiling hardly lets in any light, and a bare light bulb stays on even during the day. Kalawi pays $100 a month, steep for the no-frills space, but fairly typical in a market where demand by refugees has sharply driven up rents. Money is always on her mind. The family gets $27 per person in monthly U.N. food vouchers. Muayyad, her oldest son at 14, earns $50 a week working with his grandmother in the mattress store. Kalawi has sold her gold dowry over the past three years. Two months ago, she sold her husband's wedding band, leaving her only with a gold pendant worn by her 11-year-old daughter that spells Marwa's name in English. Kalawi says she'll never sell it because it's the last link to Syria. ——— On a typical day, Kalawi wakes up around 7 a.m. to get her 4-year-old son Izzedine ready. Kalawi's half-brother, 11-year-old Hussein, who lives with her mother next door, walks him to school. Marwa and 7-year-old Mohannad get to sleep a little longer because Lebanon schools operate second shifts to try to accommodate tens of thousands of refugee children. On a recent morning, Kalawi shook them awake in between taking sips of coffee. Marwa, a bright, gangly girl with thick glasses and unruly ash blonde hair, is supposed to go over homework with her younger brother and tidy up while her mother is at work. Marwa says her chores are manageable, even if her brother doesn't always listen to her. She doesn't like her mother working, saying she wishes there was always someone at home. Kalawi and her aunt leave their homes at 8:45 a.m., for a short walk to the recycling center. There, they are joined by four of Kalawi's cousins. The women change from their floor-length coats into black smocks, put on plastic gloves and start sorting refuse. Glass bottles go in one bin, plastic in another, paper in a third. Kalawi says the banter between the women makes the work more bearable, though she worries about leaving two of her children alone for much of the day. Kazad, the owner, says Kalawi and the other women have become more receptive to their new surroundings. \"They were thinking in a very conservative way,\" he says. \"Now they are communicating more with Europeans who come and volunteer with us.\" He's trying to keep the company afloat after a Red Cross grant runs out at the end of the year, but fears he may have to lay off some of his 17 workers — 15 of them Syrian refugees. Kazad has organized separate English classes for his male and female employees, who are accustomed to separate worlds back home. Once a week, the women stay behind after work for a lesson taught by a volunteer from Holland. On a recent Friday afternoon, they sat on a tattered sofa and broken chairs in the back of the basement, surrounded by bags of empty glass and plastic bottles stacked to the ceiling. Kalawi bent over a coffee table and copied English verbs into a notebook, then looked to her teacher as she tried to pronounce the unfamiliar words. Sixteen years after dropping out of school, she seemed eager to soak up new information. She caught on faster than the others, at one point impatiently correcting a cousin's pronunciation. Kalawi looked pleased when the teacher praised her for memorizing the names for body parts they had learned in the previous lesson. Much of the hour was spent in merriment and pantomime; the teacher barely spoke Arabic and the refugees didn't know much English yet. Even Kalawi, typically somber and withdrawn, was infected by the giggles. The women barely took notice when a male American volunteer briefly sat in on the session. Kalawi says that in Syria, she would have been very uncomfortable talking to a man she didn't know. She feels she needs to learn English to survive in exile and help her children with homework. She also wants to keep the respect of the precocious Marwa, who is in her second year of English at school. ——— After work, Kalawi walks home with her aunt, stopping along the way to buy food from street vendors. At home, she briefly prays, prostrating herself in the Muslim ritual of worship. Little Izzedine clings to his mother as she moves around the room and starts to cook and the rest of the family returns home. The family gathers for a warm meal in the evening. Kalawi is proud of her cooking skills, as are the other women in the family. Led by her aunt Razan, the women have started talking about setting up a home catering business, but need an investor. In the evenings, after the children are asleep, Kalawi watches movies on her small TV, something she couldn't always do in Syria because her husband controlled the viewing choices. Like millions in the region who have been uprooted by fighting, Kalawi dreams of returning home one day. She misses her spacious apartment and worries her children will not get a proper education in Lebanon. But she prizes her independence and wouldn't want to remarry. \"I married when I was 15 and I was suppressed,\" she says. \"I had no personality, no point of view, I had to say 'yes, yes, yes'.\" \"Now, I have a personality, I rely on myself,\" she adds. \"I used to feel shy about everything. Now I talk freely. I participate. The ones who knew me in my old days would be surprised if they see me today.\" ——— AP is interested in hearing about challenges faced by other Arab women.

    "text": "With Donald Trump's announcement that he intends to withdraw the US from the world's largest trade deal, experts are divided over whether it can survive at all. Key points: The TPP is a 12-country free trade agreement, including the US, Australia and Japan US President-elect Donald Trump has announced he intends to withdraw from it Japanese PM Shinzo Abe says a TPP without the US is \"meaningless\" \nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is a 12-country free trade agreement that includes Australia. \nWhile Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe has said a TPP without the US is meaningless, the question is whether the remaining countries could keep the agreement alive. \nTim Harcourt, an economist with the University of NSW's business school and former chief economist of the Australian Trade Commission, said there was an appetite among some members to keep the TPP. \n\"It could [survive] if all 11 signed up, and in some ways it would get rid of some of the nasties that are typically not meant to be in free trade agreements, so it may actually be a better agreement,\" he said. \n\"Small, open economies like Vietnam, or Peru, Chile — those types of economies do very well out of these free trade agreements. \n\"It's probably Japan and the US who are the least keen of all the economies.\" It's been referred to as 'the dodgiest deal you've never heard of' and now, Fact Check answers your questions on the TPP. \nMr Harcourt said even without the US, the remaining countries could still clinch a deal. \n\"They've got to get it all though their own parliaments and they'd all have to agree to it without the US,\" he said. \n\"So I imagine for a country like Vietnam that was given quite good concessions in American textiles, it won't be as attractive for them, but it's quite possible.\" \nAccording to Mr Harcourt, a US withdrawal could backfire. \n\"It might be possible that China sets up something equivalent to the TPP with China pretty much at the helm, and that would not be a good outcome for the US.\" Japan and US central to agreement \nBut some experts argue a TPP without the US is impractical because the agreement was centred on the US and Japan. \n\"As for aiming to bring it into effect without the United States, at the 12-nation meeting there was no such discussion,\" Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said. Photo: Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe says a TPP without the US is \"meaningless\". (Reuters: Toru Hanai) \n\"The TPP is meaningless without the United States. \n\"It is for the same reason that the re-negotiation is impossible, this would disturb the fundamental balance of benefits.\" \nAlan Oxley, chair of the APEC study centre at RMIT University, said Japan had long been uncomfortable without a free trade agreement with the US. \n\"They're two of the biggest traders in the world,\" Mr Oxley said. \n\"Abe pioneered Japanese engagement in this. \n\"That's really the most important thing about this agreement because the standards that will be set in managing trade between Japan and the US, two very advanced economies, will be the standards which will then be the bases for all parties in the TPP. \n\"Ultimately, the long-term hope was that it would expand to cover all APEC economies, including China, in the long run.\" \nBut Mr Harcourt said for Japan, there was more at stake in the TPP than just trade. \n\"The reason for the TPP from a Japanese point of view was that they wanted to show China that they had economic leadership of the Pacific,\" he said. \n\"For Japan, it wasn't so much the economic benefits of the TPP, although they would have taken them. \n\"I think Japan was more interested in showing China that Japan and the US are economic leaders of the Asia-Pacific.\"",

    "text": "Kris Jenner Says Kanye West Is “Really Tired” Following Hospitalization and Tour Cancellation News \nThere’s also a new report about Yeezy being under a “spiritual attack.” By Peggy Truong Nov 22, 2016 Hours after it was reported that Kanye West had checked himself into a Los Angeles hospital “for his own health and safety” on Monday, Kris Jenner, Kourtney, and Khloé Kardashian stepped out in New York City for the annual Angel Ball. Us Weekly reported that the event, which was held in honor of the late Robert Kardashian, was supposed to be Kim’s first public appearance since her Paris robbery. While Kim rushed back to the west coast to be by Kanye’s side , Kris provided a brief update on behalf of the family. According to People , Kris told an onlooker Kanye is “exhausted.” She echoed that sentiment in an interview with Entertainment Tonight , adding that the rapper, who cancelled the final 21 shows of the Saint Pablo tour, is “just really tired… it’s a grueling tour.” Kris also spoke to Extra just before Kanye’s hospitalization news broke: “He’s exhausted, he’s just really tired. He’s had a grueling tour and it’s been a grind so he just needs some rest.” Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble at the Angel Ball on Monday Nov. 21, 2016. Getty Kris speaking on stage with Khloé and Kourtney at the Angel Ball on Monday Nov. 21, 2016. Getty Meanwhile, People has released a new report on the reason for Kanye’s hospitalization. In addition to exhaustion and sleep deprivation, one source says Kanye “feels like he’s under spiritual attack.” According to the source, it’s been going on for a while: “It’s not just the big things; it’s smaller, quieter things, internal things. You might think that it’s about Kim’s robbery, and while that didn’t help, that’s not what’s going on here. He’s dealing with a lot more subtle issues.” The source adds that the anniversary of Kanye’s mother Donda’s death “always brings him a lot of pain.” Donda passed away at the age of 58 in November 2007. “He keeps that pain internalized, but sometimes will talk about how hard this time of year is for him. He works through the pain every November,” the source says. Follow Peggy on Twitter . ",

    "text": "November 22, 2016 by Northeastern News \nMore than 100 col­lege and uni­ver­sity pres­i­dents from public and pri­vate schools across the United States have signed a state­ment urging gov­ern­ment offi­cials to con­tinue and expand the Deferred Action for Child­hood Arrivals program. \nNorth­eastern Uni­ver­sity Pres­i­dent Joseph E. Aoun added his sig­na­ture to the state­ment, which calls sup­port for DACA “a moral imper­a­tive and a national necessity.” \nDACA is an immi­gra­tion policy that pro­vides tem­po­rary relief from depor­ta­tion and a two-​​year work permit for undoc­u­mented young people who came to the U.S. as chil­dren. Inside Higher Ed reported on Monday that “more than 700,000 young people who were brought to the U.S. ille­gally as chil­dren have reg­is­tered with the fed­eral gov­ern­ment in exchange for tem­po­rary relief from the pos­si­bility of depor­ta­tion and a two-​​year renew­able work permit.” \nPresident-​​elect Donald J. Trump has indi­cated he would end the program. \nThe state­ment from col­lege pres­i­dents, orga­nized by Pomona Col­lege Pres­i­dent David Oxtoby, cites crit­ical ben­e­fits of the pro­gram, which was launched in 2012, and the “highly pos­i­tive impacts on our insti­tu­tions and communities.” \nThe state­ment con­tinues, saying “America needs talent–and these stu­dents, who have been raised and edu­cated in the United States, are already part of our national com­mu­nity. They rep­re­sent what is best about America, and as scholars and leaders they are essen­tial to the future.” \nIn a mes­sage to the campus com­mu­nity last week, Pres­i­dent Aoun wrote “let me state emphat­i­cally and unequiv­o­cally that North­eastern embraces all mem­bers of our diverse family, of every origin, back­ground, ori­en­ta­tion, gender, and belief.” The pres­i­dent called on the North­eastern com­mu­nity to “lead by example, and be a shining star for those who, at this moment in our his­tory, are seeking light.” \n\n\nState­ment in Sup­port of the Deferred Action for Child­hood Arrivals (DACA) Pro­gram and our Undoc­u­mented Immi­grant Students \nThe core mis­sion of higher edu­ca­tion is the advance­ment of knowl­edge, people, and society. As edu­ca­tional leaders, we are com­mitted to upholding free inquiry and edu­ca­tion in our col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties, and to pro­viding the oppor­tu­nity for all our stu­dents to pursue their learning and life goals. \nSince the advent of the Deferred Action for Child­hood Arrivals (DACA) pro­gram in 2012, we have seen the crit­ical ben­e­fits of this pro­gram for our stu­dents, and the highly pos­i­tive impacts on our insti­tu­tions and com­mu­ni­ties. DACA ben­e­fi­cia­ries on our cam­puses have been exem­plary stu­dent scholars and stu­dent leaders, working across campus and in the com­mu­nity. With DACA, our stu­dents and alumni have been able to pursue oppor­tu­ni­ties in busi­ness, edu­ca­tion, high tech, and the non-​​profit sector; they have gone to med­ical school, law school, and grad­uate schools in numerous dis­ci­plines. They are actively con­tributing to their local com­mu­ni­ties and economies. \nTo our country’s leaders we say that DACA should be upheld, con­tinued, and expanded. We are pre­pared to meet with you to present our case. This is both a moral imper­a­tive and a national neces­sity. America needs talent – and these stu­dents, who have been raised and edu­cated in the United States, are already part of our national com­mu­nity. They rep­re­sent what is best about America, and as scholars and leaders they are essen­tial to the future. \nWe call on our col­leagues and other leaders across the busi­ness, civic, reli­gious, and non-​​profit sec­tors to join with us in this urgent matter. \n\nTo read the full state­ment and see the cur­rent sig­na­tures of the col­lege pres­i­dents who have signed the state­ment, visit the Pomona Col­lege site .",

    "text": "Rajinikanth photographed at Mumbai international airport Highlights Rajinikanth launched the first look of his film 2.0 in Mumbai The ceremony had Salman Khan as a surprise guest 2.0 stars Akshay Kumar as the antagonist Tamil superstar Rajinikanth, done with launching the first look of his film 2.0 , was photographed at Mumbai airport on Monday, presumably flying home to Chennai. The 65-year-old actor was dressed in his habitual simplicity - a white shirt and black trousers. Walking into the terminal, he was instantly engulfed in a crowd of autograph and selfie-seekers. 2.0 is the sequel to Rajinikannth's 2010 sci-fi blockbuster Enthiran , in which he played the double role of a scientist named Dr Vaseegaran and his creation, Chitti the Robot. 2.0 also stars Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar as the antagonist , a mutated scientist named Dr Richard. Rajinkanth navigated Mumbai airport, unfazed by the fans crowding him. The first look of 2.0 - posters featuring Rajinikanth as Chitti and Akshay as Dr Richard - were launched in grand style on Sunday evening in Mumbai. Salman Khan, who claimed to have turned up uninvited, did the honours while filmmaker Karan Johar , who may or may not be distributing the film, acted as master of ceremonies. Shah Rukh Khan and Kamal Haasan , who are believed to have been invited, did not attend. At the launch, Rajinikanth said that 2.0 would rival Hollywood for its special effects. \"I enjoyed doing this film 2.0 as it is a unique film. It's a prestigious film not for action alone but for entire Indian film industry. Despite our technical excellence and financial strength, we could not reach Hollywood standard yet. But I am confident and openly saying about this film that it will reach Hollywood level. The entire film fraternity will beproud of this film,\" he said, reports news agency PTI. He also described Akshay Kumar as the hero of the film, saying that given a chance, he would have picked the role of Dr Richard over Chitti/Vaseegaran. Akshay, xxAGE, declared himself a fan of Rajinikanth, who he called \"not a star but a galaxy.\"",

    "text": "Having a bad day? Week? Year ? Planet Coaster is here to help. Advertisement \nIt won’t unelect anyone, or bring anyone back from the dead, or uncook the planet, but it will, for brief, shining moments of time, make you forget everything else except the fact you feel very, very good while playing it. \nPlanet Coaster is a theme park management game. No twists, no bold new ideas, it’s simply a 2016 take on classics like Theme Park or Roller Coaster Tycoon . You build a theme park, you design some roller coasters, you hire janitors, you watch people puke. Advertisement \nWhat makes Planet Coaster so good , though, and what sets it apart from even those genre heavyweights, is its excellence in two areas. \nThe first is its presentation. Like TP and RT , Planet Coaster knows that this is a fun game about people having fun , and so joy is at the heart of everything here. The character designs are happy. The mascots are cheery. The parks have a cartoony slant to them. The aspiratonal theme song , which would normally drive me to murder in any other circumstance, brings a smile within the confines of this experience. Even the menus are bright and breezy. It’s just a pleasant game to be around. \nThe second is that Planet Coaster knows that the real fun here is in building, not management. Sponsored \nWhile this is a management game as far as back-of-the-box genre-labelling goes, being that it’s full of stuff like income, expenditure, staff rosters and bank loans, that stuff’s for nerds, along with anyone worrying their way through the game’s career and challenge modes, which despite occupying the same amount of space on Project Coaster’s main menu, are very much peripheral experiences. \nThe heart of Planet Coaster, the thing that’s going to define it in the months and years going forwards, is its sandbox mode. Where the other game styles available are about fulfilling certain strict mission criteria, usually dabbling around the edges of someone else’s park design, sandbox drops you on an open plain and just lets you get to work. Make whatever you want. Advertisement \nIt’s daunting . At least at first. Your blank canvas. \nThe game is overflowing with options and items, from themed toilet blocks to different varieties of trash cans, and that’s before you realise that in addition to loads of pre-designed buildings, the game also includes countless objects and textures to cobble together your own stuff. \nYou’d be forgiven for taking one look at that blank canvas, or at the masterpieces already being made by fans, and just chucking it in. Digital agoraphobia is real in Project Coaster , and you are OK to feel threatened by it. Advertisement \nBut I’d also implore you to stick with it, because it doesn’t matter how big the empty spaces are, or how intimidating the build options might be, this game doesn’t care, and neither should you. The point here isn’t to build the biggest or the best theme park, it’s just simply to build . \nPlanet Coaster is a Bob Ross experience. It’s creative, it’s chill, and the pleasure comes not from the final product, but in each tree, path and building you place down along the way. Popping a bright green tree down next to a path teeming with grinning cartoon people, having the time of their lives under a clear blue sky while soft guitar strums in the background and a man dressed as a T-Rex makes kids smile...you can’t really do the wrong thing here. Anything you build will be something good . \nIt’s also one of the most distracting video games I have ever played. I’ll fire it up with every intention of building a small medieval village, but within five minutes I’ll be agonizing over the length and curve of a roller coaster turn. There might be filth all over the paths, requiring your urgent attention, but it can wait, alright , because I need these flowers to be in just the right place . Advertisement Advertisement \nPlanet Coaster is beset with pleasantries acting as diversions from pleasantries. \nOf course, most of that only applies if you want to play sandbox mode. The game’s other two options, as I’ve said, are more limited. \nChallenge mode begins with the same empty plot of land as sandbox, only you have to research new rides as you go (sandbox gives you everything) and complete allocated tasks to keep the money coming in. Play this if, instead of relaxation and happiness, you prefer spreadsheets and stress. \nCareer mode, meanwhile, is a mess. It looks and sounds like the core of the game, but is actually just a series of tutorials, and not very good ones at that. Dropping you into theme parks that have already been built, they’re all effect with little cause, as they’re continuously telling you to do things without ever doing a good job of telling you how to do them. Advertisement \nSad example: for a game all about building roller coasters, I had to hit up forums and YouTube to actually learn how to build roller coasters. The game includes some basic pop-up hints, and its main menu screen contains a link to “tutorial videos”, but...come on. GIF This is not an ideal way to handle tutorials. \nThis knowledge gap is worth overcoming, though, because Planet Coaster’s ride-building tools—which for more hardcore users will make or break the game—are fantastic. You can design a track in almost countless ways, not just basic stuff like its length and curve, but also speed and stopping gates, angles, brakes and even special effects. Advertisement \nThen, when the roller coaster itself is done, you can go nuts dressing it up in themes and even allocating custom music for it, which you’ll hear when the camera gets close enough. \nAnd yes, you can go on the rides. \nRounding out the whole thing is the mod community, which thanks to a lengthy beta is already very healthy. I’m usually wary about including mod talk within a game review, since I’m meant to be reviewing the game here, not what fans have done with it after the fact, but mods are so integral to the Planet Coaster experience that I’d be mad not to. Advertisement \nThe game ships with Steam Workshop support, so you can just head over and plug stuff straight in. From rides to buildings to the terrain you build on itself, there’s already a ton of incredible content available to flesh out your park and help you build whatever the hell you want. This can make a big difference to a more casual player, who might be more interested in just dropping cool shit on the ground than spending weeks building their own rides, and having it all right there (and looking so good) feels like we’ve accidentally been given a bunch of DLC and expansion content for free. The game only really ships with sci-fi, pirate and fairytale pre-builds. This Japanese roller coaster and surrounds were made by a fan . \nThose who are more interested in the management side of running a theme park will probably be disappointed with Planet Coaster . The game’s data (of which there’s a lot, much of it handy) and poor notifications system just aren’t linked well enough to make playing the game like this much fun. Advertisement \nInstead, Planet Coaster is best when treated as a giant LEGO set. A sunny, cheery tabula rasa, lying there waiting for you to go nuts in a never-ending quest to make yourself as happy as the grinning faces of the people lining up to take your rides for a spin.",

    "text": "ATLANTA -- Atlanta’s zoo is inviting the public to vote on names for twin giant panda cubs born in September. \nThe 11-week-old twins will be named on their 100th day of life, which falls on Dec. 12, in accordance with Chinese tradition, the zoo said in a news release Monday. \nPanda fans can go to Zoo Atlanta’s website to vote on seven sets of names starting on Monday. Voting is set to run through 11 p.m. on Dec. 4.\nPlay Video CBS This Morning Twin pandas born at Zoo Atlanta Giant panda Lun Lun gave birth to twins at the Zoo Atlanta on Saturday. They are the first giant pandas to be born in the U.S. this year. Giant p... \nAt all four U.S. zoos with giant pandas, the bears are on loan from China, and the seven pairs of proposed names were supplied by a panda conservation center in Chengdu, China. The zoo says each set of names has a special connection to the cubs or their parents, Lun Lun and Yang Yang. \n“There’s much more to this milestone than just two names,” Raymond B. King, President and CEO of Zoo Atlanta, said in a news release . “The permanence of names gives us a celebration of the achievements of the giant panda program at Zoo Atlanta and a continuation of the bright future of one of our longest-lived and most successful conservation partnerships.”\n“It’s also a tribute to our giant panda care team, who have done a tremendous and tireless job in helping Lun Lun raise two healthy, thriving young cubs,” King said.\nThe names and their meanings are: \n\n- Ba Lun and Shu Lun: Ba and Shu are ancient Sichuan names still common in China, and Ba Shu means “land of abundance.” \n\n- Jiu Jiu and Yuan Yuan: Jiu means “longevity or “long time,” while Yuan means “far distance” or “far away.” When combined, they mean “longevity and permanence.” \n\n- Lun Jia and Jia Lun: The first Jia means “addition,” while the second means “good,” ‘’fine” or praise. Lun is a reference to mother Lun Lun. \n\n- Lun Li and Lun Yu: Lun Li means “ethic” or “ethics,” while Lun Yu is Confucian Analects, a collection of sayings of Confucius and a pillar of Chinese culture.\n\n- Ya Lun and Xi Lun: Ya means “elegant,” and Xi means “happy.” So the names would mean, “Lun Lun’s elegant and happy daughters.” \n\n- Ya Lun and Xin Lun: Similar in origin to Ya Lun and Xi Lun, with Xin meaning “fragrant.” \n\n- Yang Hai and Yang Gui: Yang mean “ocean” and refers to the cubs’ father, Yang Yang. Hai means “sea,” while Gui has many meanings, including “laurel.” \n\nThe cubs, which were born Sept. 3, are expected to make their public debut at Zoo Atlanta in December or January. They are the second set of twins born to 19-year-old Lun Lun. \nThe names will be revealed at a 100 Day Naming Celebration on Dec. 12.",

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump’s charges of voter fraud in Virginia are “unfounded,” a top state elections official said Monday. “The claims of voter fraud in Virginia during the November 8 election are unfounded,” Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Edgardo Cortés said in a statement to POLITICO. “The election was fair and all votes cast by eligible voters were accurately counted.”\nStory Continued Below\nIn a series of tweets Sunday, Trump boasted about winning the Electoral College vote “in a landslide” and claimed he would have won the popular vote, too, had “millions of people who voted illegally” not cast ballots.\nTrump offered no evidence to support his accusation, which was also floated by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, a radio host who runs Infowars, a website U.S. News & World Report recognized this month as a fake news site that pushes propaganda. Election experts told POLITICO the claims have no merit.\nHours later, Trump falsely tweeted: “Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem!”\nHillary Clinton won Virginia by nearly 5 percentage points.\nIn his statement Monday, Cortés said Virginia’s election was “well administered” by more than 130 professionals with assistance from hundreds of election officials and volunteers.\nHe’s at least the second election official in as many days to rebut Trump’s fraud allegations.\n“It appears that Mr. Trump is troubled by the fact that a growing majority of Americans did not vote for him,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in a statement Sunday, according to the LA Times . “His unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd. His reckless tweets are inappropriate and unbecoming of a president-elect.”\nCortés was appointed in 2014 by Virginia's Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe.",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nFive suspects arrested in France on suspicion of planning attacks on security targets including Disneyland Paris were working for Islamic State , the Paris prosecutor has revealed. \nAuthorities said earlier this week that attacks had been planned for December 1 against police and intelligence headquarters in Paris as well as the Disneyland attraction . \nThe prosecutor’s emphasis that France was under direct threat of attacks from IS has increased fears as the country went into a weekend of political campaigning and a vote on Sunday for a center-right candidate for next year’s presidential election. \nFrance is already under a state of emergency, with soldiers patrolling the streets of the capital, following bomb and shooting attacks by Islamic militants in November 2015 which killed 130 people. Read More Disneyland Paris was among the targets of the failed ISIS plotters \n“An imminent attack was thwarted,” Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins told a news conference. \n“A Strasbourg commando team, and also a man arrested in Marseille, were given instructions to acquire arms. The instructions were given by a commander from the Iraqi-Syrian region via encrypted apps,” he said. \nHand-written documents pledging allegiance to Islamic State and glorifying martyrdom were found at a house in Strasbourg, eastern France, Molins said.

Four of the men are French, while a fifth is Moroccan. \nPolice meanwhile continued searching for an armed man after finding a dead woman in a retirement home where some 60 missionaries were living near Montpellier in southwestern France, sources close to the investigation said on Friday. \nOne source said a caretaker had contacted the police after freeing herself after being bound and gagged by the suspect.

    "text": "Demonetisation: Modi govt clains giant killing of black money but RBI data shows a damp squib \nNov 29, 2016 15:36 IST By Sandipan Sharma \nThere is a famous couplet by Iqbal that, if loosely translated, goes like this: There must be something about us that ensures we are never destroyed or decimated even when the world has been our enemy for ages. Now, apply that to the current war on illegal cash by the Narendra Modi government: It seems there is really something about Indian cash that ensures its survival. \nNote the figures. \nOn 8 November, when the prime minister announced notes of higher denomination would be outlawed with immediate effect, currency notes worth nearly Rs 14.5 lakh crore became illegal unless deposited in banks or used for select services.   Modi. PTI \nWhen the government outlawed the notes, it was said that the so-called demonetisation would help achieve three objectives: a) unearth black money stashed as cash, b) curtail funding of terror networks and c) destroy counterfeit currency. \nIt was also assumed a large part of the stashed cash would not be deposited and would be destroyed. Swept away by the euphoria, there were boisterous claims that money was being thrown into the Ganges or dumped in roadside bins. \nBut, on current evidence, it seems most of the money may actually end up getting legally tendered in banks, entering the system as white money. Whither kala dhan ? \nAccording to the RBI, since the 8 November announcement, currency notes worth Rs 8.11 lakh crore have been deposited in banks and Rs 33,498 crore (3 percent) have been exchanged. So, currency notes worth 60 percent of the total outlawed currency has already entered the system. \nBut, this does not mean 40 percent cash is still with people. Some portion of it was already with banks -- in the form of cash held in ATM machines and in bank chests. \nThere is no readily available figure for money held in ATMs and banks on the night of 8 November. But, we can get a rough idea by looking at the average amount dispensed through the 2 lakh ATMs. \nAccording to the RBI data, there were 1,03,651 on-site and 99,150 off-site ATMs in India in August 2016. \nCollectively, they dispensed Rs 2,19,657.5 crore in the month of August to customers. (So far, the RBI has been able to pump back just around 2 lakh crore back into circulation. This, incidentally, is less than the amount withdrawn by Indians just through ATMs.) \nSo, the average cash dispensed daily through ATMs was around Rs 7,322 crore. And that could roughly be the amount held in them on any given day. (LINK TO RBI DATA). \nSimilarly, bank branches all across India may have been sitting on cash to be dispensed through counters the next morning. Most of it would have been in notes of higher denomination. \nAlso, as pointed out here , a fourth of the cash in circulation may be with government agencies and thus accounted for and clean. \nSo, the amount still left in the hands of Indians could be much less than 40 percent of 'demonetisation.' And, with 32 days still left and smart money still waiting for the queues to end, the final deposit figures may stun the government. \nWhat if most of the currency in circulation returns to the accounts? What if, as was presumed earlier, not much of it remains unaccounted or gets thrown away in the Ganges? \nOne, of course, it would imply that people managed to find the means to bring most of their cash back into circulation, derailing government's dream of a windfall through a RBI write-off equivalent to the amount that doesn't return. And ta-ta to rumoured plans of depositing Rs 15,000 cash in Jan Dhan accounts. \nAnd two, it would mean Indians have found innovative means in this war against kaala dhan . \nAs Iqbal said, kuch baat hai ki hasti mit ti nahin hamari ! \nIt seems the government is now wary of a situation where the 'surgical strike' on black money could just deliver loose change. (And there is no guarantee that the money that doesn't return would be of hoarders -- the poor, the old, those without bank accounts, those unaware of the government decision would also ed up losing their legitimately held cash.) \nSo, it has now introduced a revised form of voluntary disclosure scheme, where the penalty is just five percent more (and an added lock-in period) than the 45 per cent in the scheme that ended in September. And the narrative has shifted to cash-less India, a far-fetched idea . \nBut, recovering tax from deposits would be a tricky task. One, tax disputes go on for years — seven years is the legitimate period for a file to remain open. Two, there are just around 6,000 sanctioned positions of IT officers in India, around 1,000 of them are vacant. How many deposits and accounts will they be able to verify and bring under the tax ambit? \nSo, the gains may be few. And even if they are something to sing and dance about, making evaders cough up tax could take years. \nThe Modi government may have unfortunately rushed into a long war with illegal cash. And there is no guarantee that it would be able to demolish and destroy illegal cash. \nIqbal may be smiling. \n 36 IST Related News",

    "text": "A skyscraper almost as tall as the Shard is to be added to the central London skyline, after a 73-storey building was granted planning approval.\nKnown as 1 Undershaft, the site’s address in London’s financial district, and nicknamed the Trellis, it will be the second tallest building in western Europe after the Shard, at more than 300 metres. \nThe Trellis, designed by architect Eric Parry for Singaporean developers Aroland Holdings, will have a free public viewing gallery and what it is claimed to be London’s highest restaurant. It is to be built on the site of the Aviva Tower, which is to be demolished.\nThe Museum of London is working with the developers on the possibility of installing a gallery at the top of building where there will be interactive learning spaces for schools and other educational groups.\nIt will be the tallest tower in the City of London financial district, overlooking other landmarks such as the Cheesegrater and the Gherkin. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest View of entrance from the east. Photograph: © DBOX for Eric Parry Architects \n“It is a vote of confidence in the City of London; 1 Undershaft will crown the cluster of tall buildings and will be a tower London can be truly proud of,” said Parry.\nThe approval was granted by the planning and transport committee of the City of London Corporation, which said the move was a sign that the Brexit vote had not dampened interest in construction in the capital.\nChris Hayward, chairman of the City of London committee, said: “This development shows the high levels of investor confidence in London’s status as a global city following our decision to leave the European Union. I believe this building will play an important part in increasing London’s attraction as the world’s leading financial centre.”\nThe committee approved the development by 19 to two. The building will provide 130,000 sq m of office space, 2,000 sq m of retail space and is expected to have room for 10,000 workers.\n\nThe original design was 309.6 metres and was reduced in size because of airport restrictions. When he unveiled the design a year ago , Parry said: “I wanted to do something calm.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The proposed building, next to the so-called Cheesegrater and the Gherkin skyscrapers.

    "text": "Vince McMahon was fine with Brock Lesnar losing at Survivor Series Published 24/7 \nNot many matches in recent times have split the WWE Universe like the recent Goldberg vs Brock Lesnar bout at Survivor Series. \nSome of the fans loved it, some of the fans hated it, but one thing is for sure, all of the fans were left shocked by it. \nGoldberg destroyed Lesnar in just over a minute, hitting him with two spears and one Jackhammer, before picking up the clean victory and making it 2-0 against The Beast Incarnate. Article continues below \nThe crowd's reaction was very similar to when Lesnar defeated The Undertaker at WrestleMania. There were gasps, silence, and then loud cheers as Goldberg's arm was raised. \nWith so much hype going into the match, and the fact it was two massive names sharing the squared circle for only the second time, you would think WWE would want a long match showcasing the duo. Article continues below \nHowever, in just 86 seconds, all the hype, all the build up, was over. \nThe result caused shock backstage as well as within the WWE Universe. \nAccording to numerous reports, the locker room was left stunned when Goldberg dismantled Lesnar so quickly, and that led to a few complaints backstage, which is a common thing in WWE. \nHowever, one man who had no complaints and was fine with how the match went was Vince McMahon. \nDespite initially wanting Lesnar to go over, WWE changed their minds once Goldberg put pen to paper on a new contract, extending his stay with the company in the process. \nAccording to NoDQ , the reason why McMahon was fine with the match ending in 86 seconds was because he felt it would cause a bigger buzz as it would be more shocking for the fans. \nHe also relies on the WWE Universe having a short memory, and believes one loss to Lesnar won't damage his reputation. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

    "text": "Liverpool will reportedly increase their interest in Borussia Dortmund 's teenage forward Christian Pulisic. The Reds are said to be ready to accelerate a possible January bid for 18-year-old Pulisic following the injury to Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will step up his interest in Pulisic after seeing Coutinho ruled out, according to Simon Jones of MailOnline.\nHe also detailed the other factors pushing Klopp toward adding to the Anfield club's forward line this winter: \" Coutinho is facing six weeks out with ankle ligament damage and, coupled with the long-term injury of Danny Ings and Sadio Mane's absence at the Africa Cup of Nations, Liverpool are looking to add another attacking option.\" \n\nTeenage talent Pulisic is deemed skilled and versatile enough for Liverpool's fluid attack, but Dortmund won't let him go cheaply, per Jones: \" Pulisic is versatile as he can play on either wing or through the middle behind the striker, though it is understood it would take close to £25million for Dortmund to even consider selling.\"",

    "text": "Email \nNo sibling left behind! \nArizona parents Brenda and Curt Heuer have opened their home to 52 foster children in their 12 years as foster parents. And on National Adoption Day on November 19, the couple adopted five of those children, all brothers and sisters, so that they wouldn’t be split up in the system. \n“They call us mom and dad,” Brenda, who lives in Yavapai County, tells PEOPLE. “We’re such a family, we go camping together, and we’re going to take them to Disneyland for their adoption celebration.” \nThe siblings, ages 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9, have been living with the foster parents since February 2015 and had always inquired about becoming a part of the Heuer’s forever family. Courtesy Brenda Heuer \n“We needed to keep these kids together,” explains Brenda. \nSo on Saturday, Brenda and Curt were granted adoption during Yavapai County Superior Court’s celebration of National Adoption Day. \n“These kids mean a lot to us,” says Brenda. “We have such good times together and we are doing everything we can to be good parents, we couldn’t wait to welcome them into our home — officially!” \nShe adds, “We decided to do it on National Adoption Day, because how fun is that? And there are a ton of parties and celebrations going on.” Courtesy Brenda Heuer \nThe Huers are absolutely delighted to have the siblings officially join their family and are looking forward to a bright future. \n“It’s our job as parents to teach our kids right from wrong and how to be good citizens!” says Brenda. “Everything feels right.” \nBut don’t count out the parents on fostering future kids: “You never know!” says Brenda.
