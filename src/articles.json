    "text": "Politics | Mon Nov 28, 2016 | 1:09pm EST Trump steps up search for secretary of state, to meet Petraeus FILE PHOTO - U.S. General David Petraeus, commander of the international security assistance force and commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, testifies at a Senate Armed Services committee hearing on the situation in Afghanistan, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. March... REUTERS/Jason Reed By Steve Holland and David Brunnstrom | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON \nNEW YORK/WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump on Monday stepped up his search for a new U.S. secretary of state on Monday, with the focus on former CIA head David Petraeus who is a candidate despite admitting he shared classified information with his mistress. \nThe Republican was to meet Petraeus, a retired general, at Trump Tower in Manhattan in a new round of interviews. \nOnce the top U.S. military commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, Petraeus was sentenced to two years' probation and fined $100,000 last year for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified information. \nHe admitted sharing classified information with his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. The scandal forced Petraeus to resign from the CIA in 2012. \nPetraeus has also been mentioned as a possible new secretary of defense. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, is also holding talks with Mitt Romney on Tuesday in his second recent meeting with the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. \nU.S. Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani are also in the mix for the job of America's top diplomat, Trump aides say. \nTrump spokesman Jason Miller, asked if the president-elect was nearing the end of his search for a secretary of state, said Trump is using the interview process as he works toward a final decision on the position. \n\"He’ll complete that when he’s ready,\" Miller said. \"He’s going to pick the person that he thinks will do the absolutely best job.” \nPETRAEUS TROUBLES \nPetraeus' past mishandling of classified documents is unlikely to be an obstacle to him being offered a top government post, even though Trump harshly criticized Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the election campaign for using a private email server while she was secretary of state. \nTrump often compared the prosecution of Petraeus with the lack of legal action against Clinton, who was investigated by the FBI but never charged with any offense. \n\"Just based on his public statements, I think (Trump) sees Petraeus as a good man who made a mistake, who did a fraction of what other people have done and received a lot more punishment,\" said a source who has advised the transition team on national security. \nAmong the Trump transition team, Petraeus and Romney are supported by Republicans looking for a candidate with gravitas who can unify the party, the source said. \nGiuliani is favored by aides who worked on the election campaign while ideological conservatives are more inclined toward John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations, the source said. Corker is well regarded but some in the Trump camp do not want too many senators coming into the Cabinet, the source said. \nTrump arrived back in New York on Sunday after several days in Florida for Thanksgiving. He caused a stir by on Sunday when he alleged on Twitter that “serious voter fraud” had occurred in the presidential election in New Hampshire, Virginia, and California -- states won by Clinton -- but provided no evidence to back his assertion. \nIn New Hampshire, the deadline to apply for a recount has already passed. Any strong evidence of widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire could still be investigated by the state’s attorney general, according to David Scanlan, the state’s deputy secretary of state. \nBut Scanlan emphasized that his office had not received reports of voter fraud on the scale alleged by Trump. “There’s no evidence that we’ve seen that supports claims like that. Voter fraud does occur, but it occurs in isolated instances,” he said. \nCalifornia Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd.\" \n(Additional reporting by Melissa Fares in New York and Julia Harte in Washington; Writing by Alistair Bell) Next In Politics",

    "text": "With 158 rushing yards, LeShun Daniels Jr. went over 1,000 for the season. Associated Press Box Score\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - With a possible trip to the Big Ten championship game at stake, Nebraska fell flat.\nC.J. Beathard threw three touchdown passes and the Hawkeyes pummeled No. 17 Nebraska 40-10 on Friday, knocking the Cornhuskers out of Big Ten title contention and sending Wisconsin to the championship game.\nTommy Armstrong started for Nebraska (9-3, 6-3 Big Ten) despite a balky hamstring and was just 13 of 35 passing for 125 yards. Backup Ryker Fyfe, who broke his non-throwing wrist last week, didn't take a snap until the game had long been decided.\n\"Tommy wasn't 100 percent,\" Huskers coach Mike Riley said. \"I don't know if he was the healthiest...I don't know how much it would have made a difference (to play Fyfe).\"\nNebraska's defense was just as bad as its offense.\nLeShun Daniels Jr. ran for 158 yards and two scores and George Kittle caught two TD passes for the Hawkeyes (8-4, 6-3). They closed the regular season with three straight wins — two of them over ranked opponents — and scored their most points since a win over Purdue on Oct. 15.\nIowa broke open what was expected to be a tight game with a 75-yard TD run by Akrum Wadley and a 77-yard touchdown throw from Beathard to Riley McCarron in the first quarter.\n\"We played as good as we've played all year,\" Beathard said. \"It just shows the fight and the resilience of this team.\"\nThe Badgers are big favorites to beat Minnesota on Saturday anyway. But the Cornhuskers, who entered November as a legitimate playoff contender, hardly looked like one after being outscored 102-13 in their last two road games.\n\"We gave up big plays. I think we were horrible on third down,\" Riley said. \"I'm really disappointed all the way around in all of us.\"\nTHE TAKEAWAY\nNebraska: With so much to play for, it's hard to believe that the Cornhuskers played so, so poorly. Nebraska gave up three plays of over 50 yards, and Armstrong was all over the place. The Huskers have lost three of their last four to Iowa, a fate sealed when they ran into Iowa kicker Keith Duncan on a field goal try in the fourth quarter — allowing the Hawkeyes to go up 23 a few plays later.\nIowa: The Hawkeyes didn't make it to the Big Ten title game either. But they did go 6-3 in the league, an impressive feat for a team that lost to North Dakota State of the FCS in its final nonconference game. Iowa also made its case for a high-profile bowl, which looked iffy to say the least after losing by 27 points at Penn State to start this month. \"You learn a lot about yourself in November,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said.\nB1G TITLE GAME UPDATE\nWisconsin gets the West's spot in Indianapolis next week because it beat Nebraska 23-17 (OT) in late October. In the East, Penn State might have the easiest path. The favored Nittany Lions need to beat Michigan State at home and hope favored Ohio State beats Michigan on Saturday. Ohio State needs a win and a Penn State loss — and even if the Nittany Lions take the East the Buckeyes should be in good shape for the playoff at 11-1. Michigan needs to upset the hated Buckeyes.\nEXTRA POINTS\nDaniels became the first Iowa rusher with over 1,000 yards since 2011. ...Armstrong's 13-yard TD pass to Stanley Morgan snapped a streak of over 136 minutes without allowing a touchdown for Iowa. The Hawkeyes shut out Illinois 28-0 last week. ... Wadley had 105 yards rushing on just 11 carries. ... Armstrong made his 44th career start, setting a team record for a quarterback. Taylor Martinez, his predecessor, made 43 career starts.\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\nNebraska likely stays in the Top 25. But the Huskers could find themselves drop a few spots after their second straight poor showing on the road. Iowa, which reached as high as 13th earlier this year, could sneak back after beating the Huskers and Michigan in November.\nUP NEXT\nNebraska will head to a decent bowl game just a year after sneaking into a bid with just five wins.\nIowa will find out which bowl game it will play in next Sunday.\nSeason Stats\nEdit",

    "text": "Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson on Saturday said he’s relieving the sergeant involved in the shooting death of a 19-year-old man of his police powers.\nIn a written statement emailed to the media, Johnson said he took the action because the department still has “many unanswered questions” about Wednesday night’s shooting in West Englewood.\nThe Cook County Medical Examiner’s office on Friday said an autopsy of Kajuan Raye showed he was killed by a gunshot in the back.\nJohnson said those preliminary findings along with the unsuccessful search for a weapon the sergeant said was displayed during the pursuit of Raye led to Saturday’s announcement.\n“Having been a police officer for 28 years, I know that this job is not easy and the decision to use force is extremely complex and must be made in seconds without the benefits of formal reviews and deliberations,” Johnson said in the statement.\n“However, based on the little information we know at this point, I have concerns about this incident and feel this decision is in the best interest of the department and the people of Chicago as we await a methodical and impartial investigation into exactly what transpired.”\nThe sergeant, who had already been put on desk duty, will continue to be paid but have to turn in his weapon and badge. Relieving an officer of police powers is the most serious action the police department can take during an open investigation.\nPolice say the sergeant had given chase, thinking Raye matched the description of a battery suspect. Police say Raye was shot after the teen twice appeared to point a gun at the pursuing officer. But no gun had been found at the shooting scene.\nDozens of family members and supporters gathered Friday near the scene of the shooting to remember Raye’s life and call for justice.\nRaye’s cousin, Ahkeya White, said the family was concerned about media attention paid to his prior arrest for theft, and said the teen was not doing anything wrong before police attempted to stop him Wednesday.\n“Everybody got a story. Everybody got something they don’t want to put on TV,” White said, tears streaming down her cheeks. “That moment … two nights ago, whatever he did, he wasn’t doing it then, when they shot him down. And that officer didn’t know him.”\nAbout 80 people crowded onto the sidewalk, some holding candles as they took turns at a microphone attached to a balky loudspeaker.\nFriends and relatives gathered for a vigil and balloon release at 65th and Ashland, near the site where Kajuan was shot and killed by Chicago police on Wednesday. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office announced Friday that the 19-year-old died from a gunshot wound to the back. | Andy Grimm/Sun-Times\nJohnson said earlier in the week it was not clear if the officers involved in the chase and shooting were wearing body cameras, though the department announced in September that body cameras would be issued to all patrol officers in six police districts, including the 7th District-Englewood, where Raye was shot.\nA spokeswoman for the Independent Police Review Authority, the city agency that investigates police misconduct, said Thursday that officers in the 7th District had not yet been outfitted with body cameras.\nIPRA, the city agency which investigates police shootings and allegations of misconduct, is reviewing the shooting. Surveillance camera video from a church near the shooting scene shows Raye sprinting away from a police officer, who trails the teen by a a half-dozen yards. The footage does not capture the shooting.\nWhite, Raye’s cousin, addressed the prospect of the planned lawsuit in her remarks.\n“We all work. It ain’t about no money, we don’t need money. Whatever they give … it won’t bring him back,” White said. “We’re trying to move forward… we’re going to do it by the book.”\nRaye’s death was one of three fatal shootings by Chicago police officers in the last seven days, and the second in Englewood. Darius Dishaun Jones was gunned down in the 2000 block of West 69th Street, where police officers on patrol saw Jones shooting at a 26-year-old man. Police said officers opened fire after Jones ignored “repeated” orders to drop his weapon. Jones was pronounced dead at Advocate Christ Hospital. The man he allegedly shot suffered a wound to the abdomen, and was in critical condition.\nEarly Friday, police said 37-year-old Cleotha Mitchell was shot by an officer in the 600 block of Central Park Avenue in Homan Square, after Mitchell had fatally shot 35-year-old Jeffrey Banks.\nRaye’s mother, Karonisha Ramsey, said only a few sentences, thanking the crowd of mourners.\n“And as for my baby, I guess, we gonna get justice,” she said.\nIn a phone interview several hours before the vigil, Ramsey said Raye had called her Wednesday not long before he was shot, and she said he was on his way to her Dolton home for Thanksgiving dinner, which Ramsey has always cooked up on the Wednesday before the official holiday.\nRamsey said Raye had only recently moved back to Chicago after she had sent him to live with his aunt and grandmother in Texas. The teen had been unmotivated and his grades were slipping at Thorton Fractional High School, Ramsey said, and she hoped a change of scene would help him.\n“I just wanted to put him in a different environment,” Ramsey said. “He had perfect attendance (at Thorton), he just wasn’t doing the work.”\nRaye moved back when he turned 18, and while he wasn’t in school, Ramsey said she insisted that he start working toward getting his General Equivalency Diploma, and Raye was trying to get a job at Dominos Pizza, where his sister works. Someday, the teen hoped to become a veterinarian.\n“He just loved dogs, and he kept saying he wanted to be a veterinarian. All he watched was Animal Channel,” she said. “He was a happy person. He wasn’t ever a problem.”\n# Chicago Police Department Kajuan Raye",

    "text": "Theodore Roosevelt on Criticizing the President The President-Reject A passage attributed to Theodore Roosevelt holds that it is unpatriotic, servile, and morally treasonable to proclaim that there must be no criticism of the President. - - \nClaim: Theodore Roosevelt said that speaking out against criticism of the President \"is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.\" True \nOrigin: In March 2003, Iraq was invaded by a U.S.-led coalition of forces mobilized by the George W. Bush administration on the grounds that Saddam Hussein's regime posed an imminent threat to world peace and stability. A large number of Americans remained unpersuaded by President Bush's justification for going to war, however, and thus his decision to do so was criticized before, during, and after the invasion took place. \nReflecting the growing political divide in the country, another segment of the American populace held that it was unpatriotic or even treasonous to speak out against someone who was leading the United States in a time of war. Critics fired back that far from being unpatriotic, it is one's patriotic duty to oppose a president whose policies put Americans in harm's way for no defensible reason. One way they attempted to claim the higher moral ground was by citing a quote attributed to the 25th U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt: \n“To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.” \n― Theodore Roosevelt \nThe passage is, in fact, from an editorial written by the former president in May 1918, when the U.S. was embroiled in World War I. Make no mistake, Roosevelt wasn't against the war — quite to the contrary, he believed the U.S. had entered it too reluctantly — but he was outspokenly critical of President Woodrow Wilson's conduct of the war, writing no fewer than two syndicated editorials a week over a two-year period advocating for a stronger U.S. presence on the European war front. \nRoosevelt's criticisms led to accusations of \"disloyalty\" on his part, and worse. Ralph Stout, managing editor of The Kansas City Star , took note of the vehemence the attacks on Roosevelt: \nColonel Roosevelt's criticisms of the Administration were not widely popular. The Star never had any idea they would be popular, but it believed they were right and for the real good of the country. As he had foreseen when the connection was made, \"Many of your subscribers will be perfectly furious at The Star for printing my editorials.\" They were. They wrote to The Star to denounce the Colonel for writing the articles and The Star for printing them. In popular discussion in the Middle West forms of disapproval ranged from \"He should stand by the President\" to \"He should be stood before a stone wall and shot.\" \nIt was comments like these, exacerbated by suggestions from elements within the Wilson administration that Roosevelt's views ought somehow to be suppressed, that prompted him to craft this high-minded rebuttal: \nThe President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else. \n— The Kansas City Star , 18 May 1918 \nNearly 100 years after this, the passage was used to defend critics not only of President George W. Bush, but of President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump, as well. Originally published: 22 November 2016 sources: \nRoosevelt, Theodore. Roosevelt in The Kansas City Star .

    "text": "‘G ood news for Europe,” read the first line of the analyst note . If I tell you it was from an investment bank that backed eurozone austerity to the hilt, you might guess what the good news is. Yes, François Fillon (the French Thatcher) stands poised for a runoff with Marine Le Pen (the French Mussolini) in next year’s presidential election.\nWhat could be better news for the investment banking community than having all non-fascist voters, left right and centre, obligated to vote for a politician who wants to slash the welfare state, sack workers and extend the working day?\nBerenberg, the German private bank that issued the note, could not wait to celebrate Fillon’s success in the primary. “With luck,” its chief economist, Holger Schmieding, assured clients, “2017 could be more of an opportunity … than a risk.” The “opportunity” is for a Fillon government, with no credible socialist opposition, to enact “pro-growth” measures – attacking wages, hours and welfare, and enriching the people who hold €40bn in the private bank. It is symptomatic of the huge political miscalculation that the European political elite is making.\nThe European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told an Austrian newspaper on Sunday that there would be no letup on federalising Europe; no national opt-outs from the stagnation economics administered from Brussels.\nNext Sunday, we get to see whether European centrism’s “double-or-quits” strategy will pay off. In Austria , where far-right populist Norbert Hofer is neck and neck with a Green candidate in the re-run of the election for the ceremonial presidency role, the left and centre are frantically trying to mobilise party-loyal working-class voters. They may fail.\nFrançois Fillon is as big a threat to liberal values as Marine Le Pen | Natalie Nougayrède Read more \nIn Italy, on the same day, the centre-left government looks set to lose a referendum designed to strengthen the power of the executive over parliament. If the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, steps down as a result, and Europe imposes a bank rescue plan that raids ordinary people’s savings, then you could get both a domestic banking and a eurozone crisis by Christmas.\nTo complete the pattern of wilful idiocy the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to Greek government sources, chose this week to press Greece for yet more public spending cuts – on pain, again, of the enforced collapse of its banking system. Oblivious to the neo-Nazi assaults on migrant camps in the Greek islands, the IMF in Washington – like the commission and the ECB – can only see rules and balance sheets.\nIt feels, in short, as if the European centrist elite has developed a death wish. And once you understand European culture this morbid possibility is not so far-fetched.\nIn his 1912 novel Death in Venice, Thomas Mann portrays the death-wish of cosmopolitan European culture through the love-obsession of a sick old man. The protagonist, Aschenbach, checks himself into a cosmopolitan hotel in plague-ridden Venice, to fulfil his wish to die. Writing two years before European cosmopolitanism did indeed die, Mann was already on top of the reasons why it might.\nIn the novel, city authorities deny the existence of the plague – and, in so doing, create the conditions for its spread. Often read simply as a parable about love and loss, the novel in fact deals explicitly with the self-destructiveness of what Mann called the “European soul”. Mann’s settings in this and other novels – the Lido hotel, the Swiss sanatorium – emphasise the fragility of a transnational culture once crisis breaks out.\nFor Mann, the carefully crafted polycultural world of the hotel lobby – where the Poles speak French, the Italians dress in Parisian fashion, and the band plays selections from Hungarian operetta – is a fragile illusion. When just one piece of it falls apart, everything does.\nToday our polyculturality is not so fragile as in the belle epoque. The Schengen freedoms are, for white people at least, real. The Erasmus programme, the EU’s student-exchange project, cross-pollinated the lives of more than three million students. Alongside the staid and worthy “city of culture” programme, Europe’s young people have been creating the real thing: in the Berlin arts scene, in massive music festivals such as Benicasim in Spain, in the wild nightlife of contemporary Belgrade.\nBut even this grassroots culture of globalisation is breakable, if you try hard enough – because it can only exist in a space sealed off from official politics. At the typical European bar, beach or coffee shop, tolerance exists because educated people leave their nationality and religion at the door. The assumption among the young – implicit but strong – is that all politics is bullshit and does not matter.\nNow politics and nationality have begun hammering on the door. And initially they have produced mainly paralysis and fear.\nWhen I asked the young people I met in Ferrara, in northern Italy , in September how they would respond to the new xenophobic wave, many spoke about “ genuino clandestino ” – a back-to-the-land movement that advocates disconnection with the official economy as a survival strategy against austerity.\n“It’s over, it’s impossible, the right has won,” are responses you will hear everywhere among the young, once you stop speaking to activists and listen to small-town kids wasting away their 20s in their grandmother’s spare room.\nSo Fillon v Le Pen is not “good news for Europe”. Neither is Juncker’s promise to double down on all the mistakes that led us here; nor the IMF’s insistence that Greece should destroy its democracy some more; nor Renzi’s decision to play shit or bust with the Italian banking system.\nThis is no longer a confident, transnational elite, revelling in Samuel Huntingdon’s famous description of national governments as “residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite’s global operations”. And they are now up against a far-right international movement – Trump, Farage, the Breitbart media folks – whose coherence waxes as the globalists’ coherence wanes.\nWe can stop this. But only if we reject the incessant demand for austerity, privatisation, longer hours, lower wages and the theft of a young generation’s future. That’s why the centre-left, in the short time available, must find the French people somebody better than Fillon.",

Organ donation has in fact become somewhat of a taboo. \nIn the meantime, individual’s like Caroline’s uncle die unnecessarily, or are forced to turn to an unregulated and unsafe market that has sprung up around organ donation in reaction to the country’s health inefficiencies. \nOne area in which Kenya is developing, however, is in terms of ICT, and this is gradually creeping into schools. The government has launched a laptops for schools policy, while numerous multinationals and local startups are developing solutions whereby the country’s education sector is improved by technology. \nCaroline, fresh from losing her uncle, was a beneficiary of this movement. So much so, that within two years of his death she has rolled out her own solution to the problem he faced – Life Pocket. \nA mobile app, Life Pocket connects patients with donors, doctors and hospitals. All are able to register on the platform, with the aim of connecting patients and donors in a way that has previously proven impossible. It is currently being piloted by a number of hospitals across the country, ahead of a nationwide rollout in October. \nCaroline said Life Pocket also aims to raise awareness about donating organs and stop it from being a taboo subject. She said, \nThe app has a feature that contains all organs, where one can learn more about donating and whether or not it would have any negative effect on the health of the donor. \nIt also has features like a forum, where different donors and recipients can interact with doctors in varied fields of health expertise. Organ recipients can also share their journey milestones before and after donation. \nShe said she cannot wait to see the app fully rolled out, and hopes it prevents others having to experience what her uncle went through. \nYet Life Pocket seemed a long way from being developed until Damaris Mutati, Caroline’s teacher at Embakasi Girls Secondary School, began to introduce technology to her students, something she feels is vital to the development of young people on the continent. \nAs Demaris points out, \nTechnology is important to the lives of young Africans and being in a developing continent it needs more job creators than seekers. \nThis can only be achieved if schools integrate more ICT skills into their curriculum as well as encourage young people to be developers of their own ideas, and consumers of their own technological products. This then would create more employment opportunities for the young people across the continent. \nThis has certainly proven the case with Caroline, who also roped in a number of friends to help her develop Life Pocket. So passionate was Mutati on the subject, meanwhile, that she participated in two programs run by multinational tech firm Intel in Kenya. The programs – Teach, and She Will Connect – were aimed at helping teachers pass on IT knowledge to children. NAIROBI, KENYA – NOVEMBER 6 : DAMARIS, CAROLINE, AND SEVERAL STUDENTS WORKING ON APP IN COMPUTER LAB IN EMBAKASI GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL IN MUKURU AREA. Photo by Guillaume Bonn/ Getty Images Assignment for intel \nIntel’s involvement went deeper, however, with staff volunteering to teach a coding workshop at Caroline’s school, where the pupils were introduced to Intel XDK. Intel XDK is a unified development environment that enables users to design, create, test and deploy HTML5 apps. \nThis proved the inspiration for Caroline to build her app, with the schoolgirl saying the input of the company was critical. \nMany more young girls can successfully follow in my footsteps if they are exposed to programming. \nThis is something that Intel agrees with. According to Rosalind Hudnell, vice president of worldwide corporate affairs and president of the Intel Foundation, the company’s She Will Connect program is dedicated to closing the internet gender gap that exists in many developing countries. \nThe initiative has resonated with people because it empowers young women and opens up opportunity to acquire or improve digital literacy skills and expand their understanding and use of technology. \nThrough this, women can then more easily connect to resources that enable them to receive a better education, enhance their political participation, have a stronger voice in their communities, and increase their income by connecting to new economic opportunities. \nShe said Mutati, who went through the program and decided to integrate technology and coding into her classroom, was a perfect example of this. \nHudnell said, \nCaroline’s story is just one of many. The results we’ve seen just in the last two years have been amazing. \nAs technology continues to advance, it will only become more important to make sure that Africa’s innovators have access to the latest tools and resources. In the coming years, this will be our focus – to ensure that people like Damaris and Caroline are empowered to reach their full potential through technology.",

    "text": "WWE are asking fans if they want to see Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg 3 Published 24/7 \nFollowing Goldberg’s relatively quick destruction of Brock Lesnar at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, attention is already turning to 2017 where the two icons are reportedly set to meet for the third time. \nGoldberg is already 2-0 up against The Beast Incarnate, adding last weekend’s win to his WrestleMania XX victory, as both men went on to leave the company following an underwhelming match. 2-0 AGAINST THE BEAST \nHowever, with Goldberg sticking around, it’s expected that the Royal Rumble match will be used as a platform for Lesnar to cost him the chance to win, and set up a third and final encounter at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer? Sign up now and submit a 250-word test article: http://gms.to/haveyoursay4 Article continues below \nThe WWE have now taken an interesting tactic to see whether its fans will be interested to see a third battle between the pair, with some slightly surprising results. \nWWE.com ran a poll over the weekend , giving fans two options to share their opinion on whether the match is something they'd want to see again. Article continues below Arjen Robben has named his dream XI and it’s ridiculously attack-minded \nIt was a simple yes or no question; whether fans did want to see what an angry Lesnar does in his response to his loss at Survivor Series, or whether Goldberg being 2-0 up already means there's nothing left to prove. \nThe WWE often run polls on their Twitter account, asking fans whether they enjoyed an episode of Monday Night Raw, or NXT, for example. \nSometimes, they take the feedback and change certain things, so it remains to be seen whether they take fan input into question here as 47% of the fans that voted don’t want to see them compete against each other again. GOLDBERG VS. LESNAR 3? \nEven if it isn’t against Lesnar, Goldberg could still stick around if he receives the same amount of money he did for Survivor Series. \nOn The Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Dave Meltzer noted: “The situation is, [Bill] Goldberg got a deal from WWE to do one show, and it was a real big money deal. \n“The impression I’ve got is that he will wrestle as many times for that figure, as many times as Vince [McMahon] wants him to wrestle. \n“So the ball’s in Vince’s court. It’s not like [Goldberg] is going in there and saying. ’I’m ready to retire.’ If they meet his number, he’ll be there. So, it’s up to Vince.” \nSeth Rollins has also been touted as a potential opponent for Goldberg, but with Vince and the WWE going all in on this feud, it doesn’t seem like fan reaction will deter them from their long-term plans. \nDo you want to see Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar 3?

    "text": "Nandan Nilekani had unsuccessfully fought on Congress ticket in 2014 General Election. But, in a bipartisan manner, Nilekani credited both the UPA and Modi government for India’s march towards digitisation. (Source: Facebook) Nandan Nilekani, former Chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India, is confident that demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will help India achieve in 3-6 months what it could have done in 3-6 years in terms of the digitisation of Indian economy for financial services.\nNilekani, who was roped in as the chairman of UIDAI by the UPA government, has always batted for cashless transactions and digitisation of the Indian economy. He believes that the sudden “shock” of demonetisation announced by PM Modi on November 8, would leapfrog Indian Economy into a digitised cashless economy in the next 3-6 months.\n“From my perspective, the shock to the system, I think, will give a big boost to digitisation. In the last seven years, the infrastructure for digital financial services — Aadhar, UPI the JAM infrastructure, USSD and micro-ATMs — have been laid down. What, I thought, would take 3-6 years to roll out, I now believe that, with the urgency of the matter, will happen in 3-6 months,” Nilekani said in an interview with NDTV on Monday.\nExplaining his “theory” further, the co-founder of Infosys said that India is going to see a “massive acceleration of the digitisation of Indian economy for financial services” in the next 3-6 months.\nFor instance, he said India has about 1-1.5 million PoS (point of sale) machines installed in the last 30-40 years. The PoS machine allows card-based transactions. He said the number of PoS would “double or triple in the next 3-6 months.”\nSimilarly, there are about 130000 micro-ATMs, which allows people to do cashless transactions in rural areas. The number of micro-ATMS would also increase up to a million or more, he told the channel.\nTalking about the pain caused to scores of people, especially the poor and daily wagers, who are still not part of the formal economy, Nilekani said, “There will definitely be some amount of short-term pain in the coming weeks. But you are going to see that this acceleration is going to benefit everybody.”‘\nDespite the “pain”, he said, “you are going to see very high financial inclusion.”",

Key points: Justin Trudeau's comments on Castro are markedly more positive than most Western leaders' He warmly recalled his late father's friendship with Castro \"Is this a real statement or parody?\" Marco Rubio tweets \nCastro, who died on Friday aged 90 , won support for bringing schools and hospitals to the poor but also created legions of enemies for his ruthless suppression of dissent. \nMr Trudeau's comments on Castro were markedly more positive than most Western leaders' , who either condemned the revolutionary leader's human rights record or tip-toed around the subject. Take a look back at some key events in US-Cuba relations from US occupations to Cold War enmity, and even the brink of nuclear war. \nInstead, Mr Trudeau warmly recalled his late father's friendship with Castro and his own meeting with Castro's three sons and brother — Raul, Cuba's current President — during a visit to the island nation earlier this month. \n\"While a controversial figure, both Mr Castro's supporters and detractors recognised his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for 'el Comandante',\" Mr Trudeau said in the statement. \nHe called Castro \"larger than life\" and \"a legendary revolutionary and orator\". \nCastro was an honorary pall bearer at the 2000 funeral of Mr Trudeau's father, former prime minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau. \nIn 1976, the senior Trudeau became the first NATO leader to visit Cuba since its revolution, at one point exhorting, \"Viva Castro!\" \n\"I know my father was very proud to call him a friend and I had the opportunity to meet Fidel when my father passed away,\" the Canadian Prime Minister said. \nMr Trudeau did not see Castro during his official visit to Cuba in November.",

    "text": "Tweet \nA Baltimore City police officer is being called a hero after doing everything in his power on Sunday to save the life of the infant daughter of a woman who was protesting the Baltimore police. According to WJZ-TV , protesters had taken to the streets on a cold afternoon to protest an officer-involved shooting. The protester, whose identity has not been revealed, was present with her 1-year-old daughter. \nAt some point during the protests, the woman entered a local pizzeria with her baby to try to get warm, then went back outside to join the protest. According to the pizzeria owner, Antonio Romeo, she re-entered a second time and declared that her baby was having trouble breathing. Surveillance video released of the incident shows customers calling 911 to get medical assistance. \nMajor Richard Gibson, the commander of the Baltimore Police Northern District, happened to be on patrol keeping an eye on the protesters when he got the call. Surveillance video shows the obviously distraught officer rushing into the restaurant and administering CPR for several minutes until the paramedics arrived. Tragically, the young girl never was able to resume breathing and was pronounced dead at a local hospital. \nHowever, Gibson’s attempts were not lost on the onlookers, many of whom participated in the protest, according to WJZ: \n“It was unbelieveble. Very good man, to do what he’s done. You know don’t care about the people [outside], just take care of the baby,” said Romeo. \n“I’ve got a lot of respect. He’s done a very good job. I’m sorry the baby lost her life,” said Romeo. \nPolice sources tell WJZ Maj. Gibson is very involved in the community. After the incident happened, he and the officers reportedly ordered pizza for the crowd that was protesting against police. \nIt is not clear at this time what caused the baby’s death or whether she had any pre-existing medical conditions.",

    "text": "Karl B. DeBlaker/ AP Images \nThe Panthers are a curious case. Last season they racked up a franchise record 103 points, and Gallant, who signed a contract extension in January, was runner-up for the Jack Adams Award for best coach. This year, they’re underachieving with an 11-10-1 start, but the likes of Jonathan Huberdeau, Jussi Jokinen, Nick Bjugstad, and Alex Petrovic have missed time with injury. Advertisement \nIt’s very unclear what to make of the Panthers this season, but I can think of a handful of NHL coaches who deserved to be fired before Gallant. (Which in itself isn’t a reason not to fire him, mind you.) \nGallant is beloved by his players, but he’s clashed with management over roster moves and organizational philosophies, and this deeper dispute no doubt had more to do with his firing than the slow start. While it’s far too simplistic to lay this on the fundamental differences between an analytically minded front office and an old-school head coach, it’s not wrong to describe it that way either. \nThe Panthers will now have the chance to implement their philosophies top-down, as GM Tom Rowe has been named interim coach. Maybe it’ll work. (Or maybe they’ll start winning when they get healthy, and that would’ve happened under Gallant anyway.) Still, this is very curious timing for a coach firing, and the visuals could not be shittier.",

Adnan1 Abidi / Reuters Venkaiah Naidu (L) and Narendra Modi at a meeting in New Delhi May 18, 2009. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi ADVERTISEMENT \nSince Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his government's decision to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, politicians from the ruling government as well as from the Opposition have been busy defending and damning it respectively. \nFrom Finance Minister Arun Jaitley calling it a \"minor inconvenience\" to PM Modi laughing at the trials of the common people faced with severe cash crunch during the wedding season, the responses have ranged from ironic to insensitive. (The prime minister later made amends for sniggering at the public by shedding tears on camera .) \nSweeping executive decisions that affect public life are not unknown in the history of Indian politics. The anarchy that demonetisation has unleashed, causing death and untold suffering, has been compared, quite rightly so, to the dark days of the Emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, when severe restrictions on public and press freedoms prevailed. But the strangest response came from one of Modi's own Cabinet members, Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu. \nIn an impassioned article in The Indian Express this morning, Naidu drew parallels between Modi's revolutionary bid to clean up the Indian economy and Cultural Revolution -- a term that harks back to one of the bloodiest phases of modern history. \nREAD: The 'New Normal' Has Been Around Long Before Donald Trump Or Demonetisation \nPredictably, just when observers of Indian politics think irony has died, it somehow manages to resurrect itself from the ashes like a Phoenix and take flight into the realm of the absurd. \nThe Cultural Revolution , which was launched in 1966 by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China, is remembered as an example of extreme dictatorship, resulting in the death of anything between 500,000 and 2 million people. Jason Lee / Reuters A statue of late Chairman Mao Zedong is pictured at Beijing University of Chemical Technology in Beijing, China, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo \nTomes have been written documenting the horrors of Mao's grand plan to reinvent society by hammering into ordinary citizens the first principles of his peculiar variety of socialism. Driven by the ardour of his vision, the notorious Red Guards and a large section of the students took up arms against the bourgeoisie, to clean up the evils of capitalism, but eventually pushed the entire population into hunger, stagnation and poverty. At the peak of the unrest, at least 1,800 people died in Beijing in the months of August and September 1966 alone. \nFrom 1968 onward, Mao tried to reign in the escalating violence, but by then it had gone on for far too long to be successfully contained. The official handbook of the Cultural Revolution -- popularly called the \"Little Red Book\" -- was in wide circulation, with over a billion copies printed in the 1960s. A reign of terror had taken hold of the country well and truly. Predictably, just when observers of Indian politics think irony has died another day, it somehow manages to resurrect itself from the ashes like a Phoenix and take flight into the realm of the absurd. \nAlthough the revolution saw its course long back, it ended, officially, with Mao's death in 1976, a decade after it had begun. Its aftermaths are still felt, through forms of oppression that have morphed over the years and continue to blight China's human rights records till date. \nTo invoke this grisly, undemocratic and violently anti-people moment from the dark depths of world history in order to justify a seemingly pro-people policy decision makes the I&B minister's elaborate justification appear shockingly ill-informed. \nAlso on HuffPost",

Kassidy started to gain weight when she finished high school - but has now shed it (Photo: mediadrumworld.com) \n“I was eating more, drinking a lot, smoking, not working out and didn’t eat anything healthy. \n“I definitely had bad habits, I was a heavy drinker which would contribute to my poor food choices as well because if I was drunk, I was eating poorly and if I was hungover, I would eat even more poorly. \n“I felt sad, ashamed, depressed, ugly and insecure, I definitely felt sorry for myself.” \nKassidy says that being pregnant with her daughter, Harley, was the boost that made her decide that she needed to lose weight. At her heaviest, Kassidy was a UK size 20 but has slimmed to a svelte UK size ten (Photo: mediadrumworld.com) \n“Towards the end of my pregnancy , I obviously couldn't bend over, move around easily, or breathe. \n“I knew that I would be heavy once I delivered my daughter so I told myself that from that point on that I would never, ever be that big again.” \nLike a lot of people, Kassidy admits that when she started on her quest to lose weight she didn’t exactly know where to start. \n“I started meal prepping but I didn't exactly know what I was doing but I knew I was doing something. Kassidy was pleased with the results she saw during her weight loss journey (Photo: mediadrumworld.com) \n“I also started working out, I was doing mostly cardio and leg work outs, but I was making sure I was at the gym three to five times a week.

Kassidy grew up all over the world and describes herself as being underweight as a child (Photo: mediadrumworld.com) \n“The most important advice I can give about eating is to just eat healthy.” \nHaving worked very hard on her amazing transformation, it’s been more difficult for Kassidy than others as she was diagnosed with painful rheumatoid arthritis which causes inflammation of joints. \n“My body is in extreme pain twenty-four seven and I wasn't diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis until a few months ago so I went through my whole journey with this excruciating mystery pain,” mentions Kassidy. Kassidy was lacking in confidence before her weight loss transformation (Photo: mediadrumworld.com) \n“I pushed through even on the most difficult days and I did it. \n“I didn't think that losing weight would change anything about me emotionally and mentally but it has. \n“I am so much nicer and I'm not as insecure now which leads to confidence and confidence leads to happiness.

The most important piece of advice she could give someone wanting to lose weight is to encourage them to step out of their comfort zone. \n\"My best advice for beginners is to step out of your comfort zone and not to let other people’s opinions bother you. \n“Drink a gallon of water a day and meal prep, especially in the beginning because then you have healthy food on hand so you have less of a chance at failing.

On her web site , O'Donnell responded to critics by saying she didn't make the comment due to her infamously sour relationship with Donald Trump, but instead to raise awareness about autism. \nScientific American describes the condition here: \nAutism is a severe disorder that first appears in infancy. Individuals with autism are characterized by problems with language, social bonding and imagination. All suffer from serious communication deficits, and some are mute. They do not establish close relationships with others, preferring to remain in their own mental worlds. \nThe video shows clips edited together of Barron appearing to engage in certain, specific behaviors and uses these cherry-picked clips as \"proof\" that he has autism. According to celebrity gossip publication TMZ , Barron's mother Melania Trump has threatened to sue the maker of the video unless it is removed from YouTube.   28 November 2016 sources: \nHoft, Jim. \"AWFUL.

    "text": "Rec Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports What started as a Raiders romp ended as one of the best games of Week 12. The Raiders held off a furious comeback from the Panthers to secure a 35-32 win and their first winning season since 2002. Cam Newton and company roared back against the Raiders in the second half after falling behind 24-7 on a Khalil Mack pick-six before intermission . They promptly reeled off 25 straight points. With a pretty 44-yard touchdown pass to Kelvin Benjamin, the Panthers led 32-24 after kicking an extra point. The game pivoted on a gruesome injury to Derek Carr. The Raiders quarterback suffered what appeared to be a dislocated pinky on a snap-gone-wrong, forcing him to sit out a series while backup Matt McGloin entered the game. The Raiders went three-and-out on McGloin’s possession, the Carr threw an interception on his first possession back, setting up the Panthers on the Raiders’ 28-yard line for an eventual lead-taking touchdown. After a disastrous first half in which he went 3-for-12 passing for 18 yards and a pick-six, Newton bounced back to throw two touchdown passes. As the Panthers made their comeback, however, they repeatedly failed to convert after their touchdowns. They got their second point-after kick attempt block, then went 0-for-2 on 2-point conversion attempts as they chased the lost point on their next two touchdowns. On the Panthers second 2-point attempt, the Greg Olsen made an egregious drop. The lost points proved huge. Facing an 8-point deficit instead of a 11-point deficit, the Raiders marched 75 yards in 10 plays to score what would be the game-tying touchdown. Carr hit tight end Clive Walford for a 12-yard score, then Seth Roberts for the 2-point conversion. Beyond the interception, Carr was effective after the pinky injury. With a glove on his hand, he hooked hit Michael Crabtree for a 49-yard gain as part of a scoring drive to retake the lead with under two minutes remaining in the game. The Raiders had to settle for a field goal when an open Crabtree stumbled at the goal line on what could have been a touchdown pass. In this Storystream",

    "text": "One Obstacle to Curing Cancer: Patient Data Isn’t Shared Loading... \nScientific efforts to find cures for cancer will be severely hampered if the scientific community does not change the ways in which patient data is collected, shared, and analyzed. The development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies — the two biggest hopes for cancer cures — depend on the existence of large data sets comprising patients’ genetic and clinical information. Today, that data is fragmented and guarded in silos. Indeed, the well-kept secret in the cancer space is that progress in finding cures is being impeded as much by the lack of sharing by the players in the precision medicine ecosystem as it is by the stubbornness of the underlying science. \nWith about 20,000 genes and a total of 3 billion base pairs, finding the mutations responsible for a particular cancer is a daunting task. The larger the sets of data that contain the genomes of numerous patients, the higher the chances of finding deviations that are statistically significant. Only after this can the scientists begin their work of developing targeted therapies to overcome the effects of the mutated genes. \nThis is where the cancer ecosystem comes into play. Today, the clinical and genetic information of cancer patients is held in a variety of places: academic medical centers, community hospitals, disease-specific foundations, pharmaceutical companies, and the government. There is very little sharing of data among these institutions. Insight Center Sponsored by Medtronic Exploring cutting edge ways to lower costs and improve quality. \nLet’s begin with the academic medical centers, which are the most likely to collect genetic information on their patients. (Many of them are sequencing the genomes of all of their cancer patients.) The reasons they don’t share data lies in the nature of academic medicine. Doctors in academic centers are promoted for their research. Having exclusive use of their own data is crucial for gaining credit for research and obtaining grant money. Add to this the fact that many academic centers often cover the expenses of sequencing the genomes of their cancer patients themselves and you can understand their reluctance to share data. \nThe motivations of the pharmaceutical companies are similar: Why share data that may be critical to obtaining exclusive, patentable breakthroughs? \nThe community hospitals, which treat over 70% of all cancer patients, have vast amounts of clinical data but historically have not sequenced many of their patients. Similarly, the disease-specific foundations, whose interests are most aligned with those of patients, typically do not collect genomic data of their constituents. The few who do incur significant costs. For example, the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation spent over $40 million to collect genomic and clinical information on 1,200 multiple myeloma patients throughout their experience with the disease. The foundation has been exemplary in this regard, and its work over the past 20 years has been instrumental in leading to the development of 10 new drugs for treating multiple myeloma that have helped to triple the life expectancy of newly diagnosed patients. But there are roughly 100,000 multiple myeloma patients and only about 20% are involved with the foundation. The data of the other 80% resides in numerous silos. \nWhat is needed is to reshape the precision medicine ecosystem into one in which data is regularly shared and large data sets are stored in open-access portals available to researchers around the world. The opportunities for patentable discoveries will still exist and will actually be enhanced by the larger data sets, and most important, patients will be helped by the more rapid discovery of desperately needed therapies. \nFortunately, some efforts to reform the ecosystem are underway. Some are being spearheaded by the U.S. government both in the Obama administration’s Precision Medicine Initiative , which aims to collect genetic information of 1 million individuals, as well as Vice President Joe Biden’s Cancer Moonshot initiative . But there are also important private initiatives: the Genomic Data Commons out of the University of Chicago, the Collaborative Cancer Cloud launched by Intel and Oregon Health & Science University, and the Oncology Research information Exchange (ORIEN) — all of which are collecting data from multiple sources, normalizing it, and beginning to make it available in an open-access manner. To give just one example, both the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation and Flatiron Health have deposited their data on the Genomic Data Commons, thus doubling the size of the data available on multiple myeloma. \nWhile all these efforts are commendable, much more needs to be done. Indeed, one of the primary objectives of the recently launched Harvard Business School Kraft Precision Medicine Accelerator , which we cochair, is to make the broader health community aware of the existing efforts to increase the sharing of data and to get more institutions to join them. Toward that end, we encourage business leaders, many of whom serve on the boards of hospitals and medical foundations, to insist that these organizations start making their patient data available to the broader research community. \nThe HBS Kraft Accelerator also hopes to enlist patients in the cause. They can play a lead role in bringing about these changes. Today, there is little patient awareness of how critical it is to have their cancer tissue genetically sequenced and to have their clinical and genomic data released for inclusion in larger databases. Doing so would not only aid new drug discovery but would also help patients know which treatment approaches are most likely to be effective and which clinical trials are targeted to their specific mutations. Of course, privacy safeguards need to be put in place. \nWhile it is generally unknown, all of us have the right under HIPAA regulations to request that our medical records be released in anonymized form for research purposes. Unfortunately, few providers make their patients aware of this right. There is a glaring need for patients to be made aware of this. This is one of the main goals of the HBS Kraft Accelerator. \nEfforts like these are likely to improve the ways the members of the precision medicine ecosystem cooperate. But for patients like the two of us — one a survivor of a curable cancer and the other living with a cancer for which there still is no cure — time is of the essence. Accelerating the pace of change is something all of us can help accomplish. Richard G.

    "text": "BY: Morgan Chalfant Follow @mchalfant16 November 27, 2016 5:01 am \nThe death of Cuba’s former dictator Fidel Castro late Friday was met with both celebration and regret, with a number of American politicians spotlighting the violent oppression of his regime while some world leaders mourned his loss. \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump labeled Castro a “brutal dictator” and described his legacy as one of “firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.” Trump said his administration will work to help the Cuban people move away from oppression. \n“While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,” Trump said Saturday. “Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.” \nPresident Obama, who has cultivated warmer relations with Cuba, offered condolences to Castro’s family and acknowledged the “powerful emotions” that the event will foster in the Cuban people. Obama did not relay any direct criticism of Castro for his leadership. \n“We know that this moment fills Cubans—in Cuba and in the United States—with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation. History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him,” Obama said. \nCuban President Raul Castro announced the death of his brother late Friday in a televised address. Fidel Castro, who was 90 years old, ruled over Cuba for almost five decades before passing the power to his younger brother in 2008. A polarizing figure, Castro has been widely criticized for cracking down on political and economic freedoms, while some have praised him as a revolutionary. Fidel and Raul Castro / AP \nSecretary of State John Kerry expressed sympathy for Cuban citizens “mourning” Castro’s death and acknowledged the large role that Castro played in their lives. \n“Over more than half a century, he played an outsized role in their lives, and he influenced the direction of regional, even global affairs,” Kerry said in a statement. “As our two countries continue to move forward on the process of normalization—restoring the economic, diplomatic and cultural ties severed by a troubled past—we do so in a spirit of friendship and with an earnest desire not to ignore history but to write a new and better future for our two peoples.” \nMultiple U.S. lawmakers with ties to Cuba took the moment to offer stinging assessments of Castro’s regime, describing the former leader’s rule as oppressive and singling out his human rights abuses. \n“Since he took power over half a century ago, Fidel Castro proved to be a brutal dictator who must always be remembered by his gross abuses of human rights, systemic exploitation of Cubans, unrelenting repression, and stifling censorship upon his own people. Fidel’s oppressive legacy will haunt the Cuban regime and our hemisphere forever,” Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), whose parents fled Cuba, wrote on Facebook . \n“Fidel Castro’s death represents an historic opportunity for the United States. Instead of condoning the continuation of repressive actions of a repressive regime simply because some believe it’s been long enough, the United States and the international community must stand up and support the Cuban people as they seek ways to implement changes that bring the fundamental principles of democracy, reinstate the freedoms that inform society and unleash the creative and inventive power-of-people to build a better life for themselves and their families,” Menendez wrote. \nMany American lawmakers looked forward to the work ahead to secure freedoms for the Cuban population. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R., Fla.), who was born in Cuba and was forced out of the country along with her family at a young age, said Castro’s death was an opportunity to put an end to the “last remaining communist bastion of the Western hemisphere.” \n“We must seize the moment and help write a new chapter in the history of Cuba; that of a Cuba that is free, democratic, and prosperous,” Ros-Lehtinen said. “A Cuba where faith in God has prevailed over tyranny, a Cuba whose people rose up to meet the challenges placed before them and overcame them through sheer patriotism and love of country.” \nSen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), whose parents immigrated from Cuba, said Castro will be remembered as “an evil, murderous dictator who inflicted misery and suffering on his own people.” \n“Sadly, Fidel Castro’s death does not mean freedom for the Cuban people or justice for the democratic activists, religious leaders, and political opponents he and his brother have jailed and persecuted,” Rubio said. “The dictator has died, but the dictatorship has not.” \nSen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), whose father fled Cuba under the Castro regime, took the moment to recognize those who fought against the “brutal” Castro regime. \n“Fidel Castro’s death cannot bring back his thousands of victims, nor can it bring comfort to their families,” Cruz wrote on Facebook . “Today we remember them and honor the brave souls who fought the lonely fight against the brutal Communist dictatorship he imposed on Cuba.” Vladimir Putin and Fidel Castro in 2000 \nSeveral foreign leaders mourned the loss of the former dictator, with Russian President Vladimir Putin and others offering complimentary takes on Castro’s leadership. \n“The name of this remarkable statesman is rightfully viewed as a symbol of a whole era in modern history,” Putin said when communicating his condolences to Raul Castro. “Free and independent Cuba built by him and his fellow revolutionaries has become an influential member of the international community and serves as an inspiring example for many countries and peoples. Fidel Castro was a sincere and reliable friend of Russia.” \n“This strong and wise man always looked into the future with confidence. He embodied the high ideals of a politician, citizen and patriot who wholeheartedly believed in the cause, to which he devoted his life,” Putin continued. “Russians will always cherish his memory in their hearts.” \nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad called Castro a “great” leader in a letter of condolences sent on Saturday to the current Cuban president, according to the Syrian Arab News Agency . \n“Our friend Cuba was able under his leadership to stand its ground in the face of the most ferocious of sanctions and unfair campaigns witnessed in our modern history,” Assad wrote. “The name Fidel Castro will live forever in the minds of generations and remain an inspiration for all the peoples who aspire to achieve real independence and liberation from the yoke of colonialism and hegemony.” \nMexican President Enrique Peña Nieto wrote on Twitter that Castro “was a friend of Mexico, promoter of a bilateral relationship based on respect, dialogue and solidarity.” \nPremier Li Keqiang of the People’s Republic of China also relayed “the deepest condolences” over Castro’s death on behalf of the Chinese government and people. \n“Premier Li said in the message that Fidel Castro had devoted his life to the liberation and national development of Cuba, and as the founder, guardian and pusher of China-Cuba relations, his contribution to the bilateral relationship will always be remembered,” a statement released by the Chinese government said. \nMikhail Gorbachev, the former leader of the Soviet Union, said in a statement, “Fidel stood up for and strengthened his country at the time of the toughest American blockade, at a time of colossal pressure on him, and all the same he led his county out of that blockade onto the road of independent development.” \nCastro also earned praise from Justin Trudeau, Canada’s liberal prime minister who won election last year. Trudeau regarded the former dictator as a “larger than life leader” and said it was an honor to have met Castro, who was a friend to his father. \n“A legendary revolutionary and orator, Mr. Castro made significant improvements to the education and healthcare of his island nation. While a controversial figure, both Mr. Castro’s supporters and detractors recognized his tremendous dedication and love for the Cuban people who had a deep and lasting affection for ‘el Comandante,'” Trudeau said. “We join the people of Cuba today in mourning the loss of this remarkable leader.” \nA spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that he was “saddened” at the news of Castro’s death and underlined the commitment of the international organization to work with the Cuban people to achieve greater reform in the country. \n“President Fidel Castro will be remembered for his leadership of the Cuban revolution and for advances in Cuba in the fields of education, literacy, and health. His revolutionary ideals left few indifferent. He was a strong voice for social justice in global discussions at the U.N. General Assembly and international and regional forums,” the spokesman said. “The secretary-general extends his condolences to the Cuban people and to the family of the former president, particularly to President Raul Castro.” \nThe positive descriptions of Castro’s achievements sparked criticism, with many saying that he should not be honored for oppressing the Cuban peopled. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich chastised those praising Castro, writing on Twitter , “The outpouring of praise for Fidel Castro is tragic. He was a relentless dictator who imprisoned thousands, killed and tortured many Cubans.” \n“Castro’s policies impoverished the Cuban people. Look at the cars in pictures. A dictatorship that drove out hundreds of thousands of Cubans,” Gingrich wrote. “Build a list of those praising Castro and you will have a list of leftists who reject reality for an ideological fantasy.” \nGingrich warned Obama and Vice President Joe Biden against traveling to Cuba to attend Castro funeral, calling the former leader a “tyrant.” \nSome world figures neither praised nor criticized Castro, describing him as emblematic of the Cuban revolution. \n“Fidel Castro was a major figure of the 20th century. He embodied the Cuban revolution, in the hopes it aroused and the disappointments it provoked,” French President Francois Hollande said . “Actor of the Cold War, he represented a period of history that ended with the fall of the Soviet Union. He represented, for Cubans, pride in rejecting external domination.” \nPope Francis sent a telegram to Raul Castro expressing his condolences, saying, “I express my sentiments of sorrow to Your Excellency and other family members of the deceased dignitary, as well as to the people of this beloved nation. At the same time, I offer prayers to the Lord for his rest and I entrust the whole Cuban people to the maternal intercession of our Lady of the Charity of El Cobre, patroness of that country.”",

X What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nWhen Jessica and Ben Kennedy started planning to expand their family to welcome a third child, they never expected they’d end up with three more in the form of identical triplet boys. \nThe Kennedys welcomed Reed, Knox and Finn on Nov. 2, younger brothers to Cohen, 6, and Laine, 4. The siblings are finally all under one roof after the triplets spend three weeks in the NICU at the Missouri Baptist Medical Center. \nREAD MORE: Rare identical sister triplets home from hospital \nDr. Michael Paul, who delivered the naturally conceived babies and specializes in high-risk pregnancies , said the pregnancy was very rare due to how healthy it was and how well the boys have reached their major milestones without complications. \n“The fact that we’re blessed and that they’re as healthy as they are is obviously a God-send,” Ben told NBC-affiliate KSDK . \nREAD MORE: Identical Salmon Arm triplets home and ‘doing extremely well’ \nBut the couple admit they are nervous and feeling overwhelmed. \n“We’re hoping for the best, obviously, but we’re pretty terrified of what’s about to come our way,” Jessica said with a laugh. “We’ll just have to play it by ear and see how it goes.” \nOnly three weeks in, they’re learning how to manage the 24 feedings and double the amount of diaper changes per day. \nThe toughest part, though, could be telling the trio apart. \n“They look so much alike now,” said Jessica. “It makes me nervous!” \nThe occurrence of naturally conceived identical triplets is so rare that the odds are unclear. \nAccording to a study published in Journal of Biosocial Science in 2003 , identical triplets occurred around 20 to 30 times per 1 million births. Doctors quoted in a Canadian Press story about a B.C. woman who gave birth to identical triplet girls pegged the number at around 1 in 50 million. Reuters quoted another doctor who said that rate was closer to 1 in 200 million. ",

    "text": "Subscribe to the Times “My friends are going to Orlando to play national tournaments in air-conditioned gyms, and I’m driving an hour to play baseball in rural Indiana, where it’s 105 degrees and we’re using wooden bats and hitting is hard, hard.” He laughs. “I wondered about myself sometimes.” As he poses for photographs with his Little Leaguers on the South Side, he listens to their conversations and feels a pang for his sport. \nAdvertisement   “Kids don’t think baseball is cool,” he said. “There’s a lot of references to it being a white kid’s sport.” On the Mets, Granderson and David Wright — the team captain and a white Virginian — are the veteran leaders in a clubhouse of whites and Latinos from four nations, and a couple of African-Americans. “David and I are in the same type of position on the team,” Granderson says. “We don’t hang out, but we respect each other and always mess with and go at each other. We talk a lot of race stuff, too.” Granderson has formed friendships with teammates of all races and ethnicities. And yet, he notes, race remains a complicated calculus. If you look at the stretch circles before games, he says, you’ll most often see “a perfect pie chart: all Latinos, all blacks, all whites.” Photo Granderson (3) and the Mets after a victory on Sept. 27 during their improbable run to the postseason. Credit Lynne Sladky/Associated Press While stretching, or in the locker room, Granderson tosses out what he calls the daily race question: Food, spice, music, clothes, cars — what are your favorite kinds? The talk that follows is lighthearted and yet gives players an understated way to measure difference and similarity, and perhaps to push open life’s many doors. “Sometimes we get Terry Collins in on it,” Granderson says of the Mets’ manager. “‘Hey, T.C., what do you think about this?’ ” Most times, Granderson says, Collins just laughs, and they break off and practice. I ask about the lack of diversity among managers. Fairness in hiring is not quantum physics. Why are there so few black and Latino baseball managers? “There’s a lot of conversation about that,” Granderson replies. “We all know guys who did a good job in the minors, as a manager or pitching coach, and then a manager is hired and these guys weren’t even in the interview process. We wonder why not.” \nAdvertisement   Granderson pulls in front of his brick townhouse on the South Side. He offers a final story: As a young player, he worked with a wizard of a batting coach, Leon Durham, a former major leaguer coaching for Detroit’s Class AAA franchise in Toledo, Ohio. When players got to the big club and fell into slumps, they would hop in their cars and drive back to Toledo for a morning refresher course. Photo Leon Durham as the batting coach of the Toledo Mud Hens, the Tigers’ Class AAA team, in 2015. Durham helped Granderson during Granderson’s time in the Tigers’ organization and has just received his first promotion to a major league coaching staff, as the Tigers’ assistant hitting coach. The dwindling number of African-American players in the majors and the lack of diversity in the managing ranks are among Granderson’s concerns. Credit Mike Janes/Four Seam Images, via Associated Press Images “We’d go on a hot streak, and everyone knew: Leon was getting guys right,” Granderson says. That memory is a dozen years old. Durham just received his first promotion to a major league coaching staff. He will be the Tigers’ assistant hitting coach. “Sad to say, but you look at who owns baseball,” Granderson says of the vastly white ownership ranks. “You wonder.” Our conversation turns to that night’s fund-raiser at a hip club. All day long Granderson’s cellphone has rung, with questions about food and music and D.J.s; he has a bar mitzvah’s worth of details to attend to. It’s the off-season, his downtime. Why do all this? He mentions the example set by his parents, Mary and Curtis Sr., whom I will meet and talk with that night. Childhood sweethearts in tiny Tchula, Miss., they attended Mississippi Valley State University, married and migrated north to Chicago to work as teachers. His father was an elementary school dean who mentored scores of young men; his softball team still gives away a dozen turkeys every Thanksgiving. His mother taught high school chemistry and raised money for the Girl Scouts, the P.T.A., the church. And the Grandersons raise money each year to endow scholarships so that children from Tchula — the fifth-poorest town in our nation — can attend Mississippi Valley State. “I watched and absorbed without realizing what it was,” Granderson said. “Slowly I became a part of it. ‘Mom, so-and-so needs a ride.’ ‘Dad, so-and-so wants to eat. Can I invite him over?’ ” Photo The back of Granderson’s cleats bear the logo of his Grand Kids Foundation, which supports youth programs in Chicago. The foundation has no staff members or expenses. All the money it raises goes to the programs. Credit Samuel Icon Sportswire, via Associated Press Images This is philanthropic impulse as learned memory. In addition to his work through the Grand Kids Foundation and his youth academy, Granderson is a leaguewide spokesman for the White House’s initiatives to get children to lose weight and drink more water. He expresses frustration with himself that he has not taken more Little Leaguers from Harlem and the South Bronx to games at Citi Field. He also wants to spend more time talking to New York’s hip-hop radio stations, the better to spread the gospel of baseball. \nAdvertisement   In past years, he acknowledges, a few querulous baseball sorts asked pointedly if he risked tiring himself out with his charities. (The Mets, Granderson says, are entirely supportive, with time, money and enthusiasm.) He rolls his eyes. “I’m single, I don’t have kids yet,” he says. “You want tough? Talk to my teammates who wake to care for little babies and then have to play.” Age is an insistent visitor now. I watched Granderson spend two hours swimming, lifting weights and doing crunches. Still, he will be 36 on opening day. He plays within the shadow of career’s end.   Photo Under the watch of Nick Zostautas, a strength and conditioning coach, Granderson swam laps at the university as part of his off-season workout program. Weight lifting and crunches are also important elements. Credit Joshua Lott for The New York Times He has talked to retired players like Derek Jeter and given thought to what lies around the corner. He does not want to be that guy who stumbles where once he made a shoestring catch. “I’ve been so lucky,” he says. “I want to step aside gracefully.” He checks the time and politely excuses himself. He’s got three hours before this evening’s fund-raiser. He has calls to make and public service spiels to record. We shake hands, and Granderson moves off at a youthful trot. \nEmail: powellm@nytimes.com",

I’ve finally fought the fight of not ‘being enough.’” \nShe added, “I have only wanted to reflect the love you guys have given me for years and show how important it is to take care of YOU. By grace through faith. Kindness always wins. I love you guys. God bless.” \nAlong with the message, Gomez shared a black-and-white image of herself with fans. \nJust last weekend, the star made her triumphant return to the spotlight at the American Music Awards after taking time off to focus on her emotional health. \nMultiple sources previously confirmed to PEOPLE that the entertainer — who has lupus — was seeking professional help to get back into a positive headspace. \n“She decided to clear her calendar for the year in order to have this be her priority for future happiness and didn’t want to leave any promoters at bay,” a source close to Gomez told PEOPLE at the time about the star’s career break. “She feels relieved that she can now make more sense of why she was feeling the way she was and is optimistic about the future.” \nGomez also told PEOPLE in a statement that lupus had contributed to her stress, anxiety and depression. \nRELATED VIDEO: Selena Gomez Taking Time Off After Dealing with ‘Anxiety, Panic Attacks and Depression’ Due to Her Lupus Diagnosis While accepting the award for favorite female artist in the pop/rock category last Sunday, Gomez addressed her time off, emotionally telling the crowd , “If you are broken, you do not have to stay broken … whether you respect me or not, one thing you should know about is I care about people.” Show Full Article",

    "text": "R yanair may have learned to show a little love to its customers, but one group of people still gets the more traditional Ryanair treatment. Onstage in jumper and jeans in front of a crowd of suits at the Airport Operators Association conference, chief executive Michael O’Leary slouched grumpily in a seat and announced: “I’ve got far better things to do than to talk to a bunch of overcharging airports.”\nNonetheless, O’Leary outlined his airline’s plans: to cut fares and fly ever more people. That was, he said, “great news for all the bankers and robbers assembled in this room who will not be reducing their charges, and who will all be making out like highwaymen and bandits as they continue to see rising passenger numbers at their airports, rising retail sales and rising restaurant sales. All on the back of the poor stupid Irish who will be carrying all these people at even lower prices.”\nBitter? Very. But after the tirades, O’Leary shared a dream: “I have this vision that in the next five to 10 years fares on Ryanair will be free ; in which case the flights will be full, and we will be making our money out of sharing the airport revenues of all the people who will be running through airports, and getting a share of the shopping and the retail revenues.”\nCould that dream ever become reality? Certainly, the tills have been flowing freely at Stansted airport, Ryanair’s biggest UK base.\nThe departure lounge, completed a year ago, is testament to the possibilities. The short distance to the departure gates can only be negotiated via a meandering trail through the duty-free. A hard right at Jo Malone takes you straight into the arms of the Jack Daniel’s boutique, before sniffing the air through a chicane of Lancôme and Estée Lauder, into an oxbow bend through the fashion stores. Then it’s one last loop through the food and drink – with millions stopping off at the third-most-lucrative Pret a Manger in Britain for the last decent sandwich before the airline trolley.\nThis retail spending is the prize O’Leary covets. The airports, however, reckon that Ryanair already gets its share. The owner of Stansted, Manchester Airports Group, signed a 10-year deal with Ryanair soon after acquiring the airport for £1.5bn in 2013. In return for more passengers, Ryanair got lower charges. Alongside, the airport gave the terminal an £80m transformation, adding 50% more space in the departure lounge. And the airline loosened up its notoriously tight policy on carry-on bags to allow people to bring their shopping aboard.\nDetails of the deal aren’t public, but Stansted’s accounts suggest its structure has made additional passengers in effect free of charge for the airline, if not better. Almost 80% of Stansted’s passengers now fly with Ryanair, and the airport’s income from aeronautical charges fell from £148m to £141m this year, even as passenger numbers rose by 11% to 23.1 million. But those 2 million more people passing through the doors kept shopping, with a higher average spending of £5.70 per person (including parking) – meaning that Stansted’s overall revenues still rose a healthy 5%.\nElsewhere, the degree is different, but the principle holds. Nick Dunn, the chief financial officer of Gatwick airport, says: “Our overall charges reflect the money we make in retail and parking: inherently, there is already discount or cross-subsidy there for airlines.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary: ’Im doing seat sales at £4 and I’m paying the £13 APD. I’m paying you to fly with me.” Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images \nGatwick signed its own growth deal with its major customer, easyJet, with “quite an incentive” to bring in more passengers, particularly in the off-season. Ryanair only flies around 1 million of the airport’s 43 million passengers a year, meaning Gatwick’s focus can be on higher levels of service demanded by other airlines, with correspondingly higher charges (nearer £9).\nFree won’t happen here, O’Leary admits: but where Ryanair can bring its clout, and where airports are desperate for growth, zero hour beckons.\nAviation consultant John Strickland says: “Ryanair already negotiate the lowest charges, so if they want to share the retail pie then airports will be reluctant: they already use that income to subsidise charges. But if airlines can grow that pie, that would be a very attractive proposition. It would have to go beyond the airline-airport dynamic as it is today: they would have to jointly sell something new, by convincing airline customers to buy at the airport.”\nTo what extent Ryanair needs this is debatable. Its bargain fares have always been supplemented with expensive add-ons, from bags to booking fees, and “free” fares are unlikely to be different, even if Ryanair has moderated its more punitive charges. Pre-booked bags still generate an undisclosed but sizeable chunk of the €3.2bn fare revenue Ryanair took in the first half of this year; ancillary revenues – from car hire to seat selection and onboard food – made almost €1bn more. But even those streams may soon look traditional.\nAlready, says Strickland, “more than 20% of their revenues don’t come from tickets anyway, but things we buy onboard or via their website. Their ambition is to be more like an Amazon.”\nAt Ryanair, the mantra is “load factor active, yield passive” – or fill the planes, whatever the fare. And more planes need to be filled, with a fleet growing to double passenger numbers to over 200m in a decade.\nThat scale alone, says O’Leary, means fares will fall. But that is just the start. Sales won’t be just inflight or at the airport, or even the holiday – but capturing the customer for everyday transactions via My Ryanair, the registration database, for all manner of promotions.\nAlas, for most summer holidays, fares will remain far from free. But for the flexible, minimalist traveller to less fashionable airports, free fares could really mean free – and sooner rather than later if Britain does ever cut air passenger duty (APD), as airlines beg. “If I start getting that back, why not? I’m doing seat sales this week at £4 and I’m paying the £13 APD,” growls O’Leary. “I’m paying you to fly with me.”\nCostly extras Baggage \nOften an inescapable add-on for families and leisure travellers, although O’Leary (again) claims to have done the world a service by weaning flyers off their luggage habit. Checked-in bags booked online will typically cost £15-£50 on Ryanair, rising to £60 per bag at the airport. A 20kg bag will cost £13-£30 on easyJet. British Airways’ fares normally include one checked-in suitcase of up to 23kg, although it has muddied the waters by offering “hand-baggage only” fares in recent years. The hand-luggage allowance can also be a trap for the unwary: a heavy, small suitcase is fine on BA or easyJet, but it needs to weigh less than 10kg on Ryanair or Monarch. On Wizz, a small case as hand baggage still incurs a charge.\nSeating \nOn easyJet, it costs from £1.99 simply to choose, rising to £19.99 to pick the best seats. Ryanair charges £15 for the best seats (£22.50 if done at airport check-in) but picking any seat yourself will cost £8. With BA’s lowest-priced tickets, choosing seats costs an extra £7.\nPriority boarding \nThis is wrapped in with choosing a premium seat on easyJet, but you can still pay another £5 for the privilege at Ryanair.\nPayment \nUsing a credit rather than debit card means a 2% charge on Ryanair, 1% on easyJet. BA charges £5 per ticket (not per booking) but will move to a 1% fee next month.",

An apology from Toure earlier this month saw the 33-year-old phased back into the first-team matchday squad. Toure railed against the verdict in January 2016 when Aubameyang ended his four-year reign as Africa's top player, saying it brought 'shame on Africa' and was 'indecent' that his own achievement as the African Nations Cup-winning captain was not sufficiently recognised.

Trump and his transition team are in the process of filling cabinet and other high level positions for the new administration. 0 Shares Email After running a campaign in which he lambasted political opponents as liars and \"crooked,\" derided Muslims and Mexicans, and took aim at women who accused him of sexual assault, President-elect Donald Trump had a new message for the country on the eve of Thanksgiving -- unity. \"Emotions are raw and tensions just don’t heal overnight,\" Trump, who has largely been out of sight since Election Day , said in the video posted Wednesday. \"It doesn’t go quickly, unfortunately, but we have before us the chance now to make history together to bring real change to Washington.\" As Trump has worked behind the scenes to assemble his Cabinet, divisions that surfaced during the campaign clearly have not subsided. Trump Team Requests Security Clearance for Jared Kushner In interviews following his victory, Trump been forced to address disturbing behavior from 'alt-right' hate groups and several reports of attacks by supporters who claim to be carrying out harassment and even violence in his name. He has urged those supporters to \"stop\" and that he disavows any hate groups who may have been energized by his victory. During the campaign, Trump called for a complete temporary ban on Muslim immigrants, derided some Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, called President Obama the founder of ISIS, refused to acknowledge that the president was a natural-born citizen for months and launching into Twitter salvos not only against political opponents but members of the media as well.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2016 Trump vehemently denied the sex assault allegations and threatened to sue over coverage of the stories. He publicly mocked a disabled reporter and gave rivals nicknames such as \"Lyin'\" Ted Cruz, \"Little\" Marco Rubio and \"Crooked\" Hillary Clinton , whom he threatened to throw in jail over her email scandal. His campaign rallies were regularly punctuated with chants of \"lock her up.\" In the video message, Trump urged Americans to use the holiday to \"begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country, strengthened by a shared purpose and very, very common resolve.\" The Trump family will be spending their Thanksgiving together in the luxurious Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where they have vacationed for the past two decades. 0 Shares",

    "text": "The parents of an Ottawa man who died while at school in Toronto in 2001 are suing Toronto police over their investigation, claiming they mishandled evidence that could have proven he didn't kill himself.\nJohn Kevin Connelly, 22, was a third-year pharmacy student at the University of Toronto whose body was found outside his Walmer Road apartment building Dec. 9, 2001.\nIn their statement of claim, John and Gloria Connelly said police concluded their son killed himself by jumping off the building's roof after leaving a suicide note on his desk because he was upset over his breakup with his fiancée​.\nToronto police confirmed Tuesday they have been served with the lawsuit and are putting forward a statement of defence.\nThe family's main points The Connellys claim police \"consistently obstructed and hindered the death investigation by destroying, ignoring, changing and replacing death scene evidence,\" including:\nInitially saying John Connelly's body was found 10 metres from his apartment building, supporting the theory he took a running jump, then years later confirming he was found five metres away. Failing to take photos of a bloody pillow case in his apartment until several months after his death, then losing or misplacing the bedding. Failing to explain adequately how Connelly sustained \"a cluster of large bruises\" on his forehead even though their theory was that he'd landed on his feet and fallen backward. Failing to investigate a neighbour's report of two \"miserable looking\" men using keys to get into Connelly's apartment in the days before he died. Paramedics found pulse The Connellys are also claiming police could have contributed to their son's death because officers reported finding him without vital signs, only to have paramedics find a pulse 12 to 13 minutes later.\n\"In the past 15 years we've appealed to at least 10 provincial oversight bodies , without success. So the responsibility of police oversight has fallen on our shoulders,\" the Connellys said in a statement.\n\"We're suing the police because this is a matter of accountability and public safety that affects all of us.\"\nThe Connellys are suing the Toronto Police Services Board for $5 million for negligence, $5 million for wrongful death, $2 million in special damages and punitive and/or aggravated damages of $500,000, plus costs.\nThey also want Toronto police to admit they should have conducted a homicide investigation at the time and to begin one now.",

    "text": "Philippines Kerwin Espinosa: Albuera top cop introduced me to Ronnie Dayan (UPDATED) Kerwin Espinosa testifies at the Senate inquiry into the death of his father, Albuera mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr Published 11:08 AM, November 23, 2016 Updated 3:53   SENATE PROBE. Alleged drug lord takes his oath before testifying at the Senate inquiry into the death of his father, the late Albuera mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr on November 23, 2016. Photo by Cesar Tomambo/PRIB \nMANILA, Philippines (UPDATED) – He was the police chief who relentlessly chased after an alleged drug lord and his father-protector but according to Kerwin Espinosa, it was Chief Inspector Jovie Espenido himself who apparently acted as his supposed link to Senator Leila de Lima. ‬‪In a 27-page affidavit executed before the Philippine National Police (PNP), alleged Eastern Visayas drug lord Espinosa said that in the first or second week of August, Espenido contacted him to say that a “driver/security aide” of De Lima, then justice secretary, wanted to talk to him. ‬ \n‪In the affidavit, however, Espinosa is not asked to confirm if the \"Juvi Espinido\" named in the affidavit is the same Espenido who now heads the Albuera police office. ‬‪ \nEspinosa is the key witness in a Senate probe into the death of the late Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa Sr, father of Kerwin Espinosa. ‬‪De Lima allegedly received election funds from the Espinosas through her driver, Ronnie Dayan. \nMissing CCTV \n‪Espinosa further pinned down Espenido, claiming that the Albuera police chief took CCTV footage that would prove he transacted with another cop, Superintendent Marvin Marcos. He said the handed over the money to Marcos just outside his hotel in Albuera. ‬ (READ: Kerwin Espinosa: Cop who led operations vs dad asked for P3M )‪Espenido was assigned to head the Albuera police office mid-July, or weeks after PNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa was appointed the country’s top cop. Assigning “tough” police chiefs, said Dela Rosa, was part of the PNP’s strategy to catch local chief executives who were involved in illegal drugs themselves. ‪It is unclear, however, if Dela Rosa handpicked Espenido. ‬‪Speaking to media on the sidelines of the hearing, Dela Rosa said he got “advanced info” of Espenido’s supposed involvement in illegal drugs, after police officials first went to Abu Dhabi to facilitate Espinosa’s arrest. ‬‪“ Nagulat kasi kasama siya doon sa… siya ang agresibo sa anti-drug operation natin sa Region 8 (I was surprised because he was aggressive in our anti-drug operation in Region 8),” said Dela Rosa. ‬ \nPersonal grudge \nEspinosa said his father was \"innocent\" and had no links to the drug trade but Espenido allegedly included him in the local drug list because of a personal grudge. He said that his father eventually learned about his illicit trade but \"could not control\" him.‪In his affidavit, Espinosa said that Espenido had an ax to grind against him. Back in 1999, Espinosa said he worked for the Locsin political clan in Leyte. Espinosa said his job was to convince barangay captains to shift loyalties to the Locsins. Espenido, said Espinosa, was working for a rival political clan, the Codillas. ‬‪“ Binalak akong patayin ni Espenido noon at ang balak niya na iyon ay naikwento sa kay Barangay Abondio Magno na naikuwento naman niya sa akin (Espenido planned to kill me and Barangay (official) Abondio Magno told me about this plan),” said Espinosa in his affidavit. But Espenido supposedly shot the wrong person, was sued, then went into hiding. ‬‪“ Hanggang ngayon ay nagtatanim siya ng galit sa akin at sa aking pamilya (Until now, he is angry at me anf our family),” added Espinosa. ‬ \nEspinosa is a key resource person of the Senate Committees on Dangerous Drugs and Public Order and Justice and Human Rights, which are jointly conducting the inquiry. (READ: Senate probe: What secrets will Kerwin Espinosa spill? ) \nThe alleged drug lord had been in hiding abroad for several months until he was nabbed by authorities in Abu Dhabi , in coordination with Philippine police, in October. He was brought back to the country on November 18. \nPhilippine National Police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa earlier said that Espinosa – said to be the top drug lord in Eastern Visayas with operations in Central and Western Visayas – was the “ missing piece in the puzzle ” of the illegal drugs trade not only in Eastern Visayas.",

No charges or lawsuits had been filed as of Tuesday. \nREAD MORE: 10-year-old boy who died on Kansas waterslide was decapitated: report \nMichael Rader, an attorney for the Schwabs, told KMBC-TV that he had been working with Schlitterbahn and its legal team on a plan to eventually remove the slide, but said it “cannot be torn down until all investigations and potential litigation has concluded.” Scott Schwab didn’t respond to a text message seeking comment Wednesday. \nLynn Johnson, an attorney for the women, said in August that his clients “want answers and assurances from Schlitterbahn that that slide will be corrected or not continue to be in operation,” saying there would be litigation, if necessary. He didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday. \nWATCH: 12-year-old boy dies on ‘world’s largest’ water slide in Kansas \nVerruckt, which is German for “insane,” featured multi-person rafts that made a 17-story drop at speeds of up to 70 mph, followed by a surge up a hump and a 50-foot descent to a finishing pool. \nRiders were required to be at least 54 inches tall. They were harnessed with two nylon seatbelt-like straps, one crossing the rider’s lap, the other stretching diagonally like a car shoulder seatbelt. Each strap is held in place by long straps that close with fabric fasteners, not buckles. Riders hold ropes inside the raft. \nREAD MORE: Father of Kansas boy killed on waterslide thanks supporters \nRiders are weighed to ensure that each raft carries between 400 pounds and 550 pounds. \nThe regulation of waterslides and other amusement rides has drawn scrutiny since Caleb’s death.

A document released by the state Department of Labor after Caleb’s death showed that all of Schlitterbahn’s rides passed private inspections in June. \nSchlitterbahn Waterparks and Resorts said in its statement Tuesday that it has been cooperating with investigators and the victims’ families and attorneys, noting that “the safety of our staff and our guests is our top priority.” \n“In our 50 years of providing an environment for families and friends to gather,” the statement read, “we’ve never experienced this kind of devastating event.” © 2016 The Canadian Press ",

Unesco doesn't give out such awards. \nBut this is not India's first Unesco hoax. A widely-circulated mail in 2008 said it had called the Indian national anthem the \"best\" in the world. \nThe news became so widespread that Unesco had to issue a clarification that it had not given out any such award. \n\"We are aware of several blogs in India reporting this story, but can assure you that Unesco has made no such announcement concerning the anthem of India or any country,\" a Unesco official told the India Today website in 2008. \nThen a more recent hoax said that the agency had announced Narendra Modi was the \"best prime minister in the world\". \nSuch hoaxes are frequently circulated, but the latest one about the 2,000 rupee note has made headlines because of India's currency crisis. \nThe government's surprise decision to ban the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes overnight in a crackdown on corruption has impacted 86% of the money circulating in the country's largely cash economy. \nLong queues have become a familiar sight in front of ATMs and banks as people struggle to withdraw money.",

Is Set to Take Its Place on the Las Vegas Strip By NAILA-JEAN MEYERS Continue reading the main story Photo At the new T-Mobile Arena, home of the N.H.L.’s expansion team in Las Vegas, an image of a blackjack table was projected onto the ice before a preseason game between the Los Angeles Kings and the Dallas Stars last month. Credit Isaac Brekken/Associated Press In an office building in suburban Las Vegas, an N.H.L. franchise is taking shape. It has been five months since the N.H.L. awarded Las Vegas an expansion team on June 22. It will be about 11 more months before the team plays its first regular-season game. But as the N.H.L’s other 30 teams settle into the rhythms of a long season, the Las Vegas franchise, the N.H.L’s first expansion team since the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild were added in 2000, is building its staff and expanding its local footprint. The team will check a big item off its to-do list on Tuesday night, when its name and logo will be revealed in a ceremony outside the new T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip, where the team will play. The team is expected to have Knights in its name, either of the Desert, Golden or Silver variety. Bill Foley, the team’s owner and a graduate of the United States Military Academy, had hoped to call the team the Black Knights but encountered resistance, including some from West Point. He said he settled on a name by the end of August, and team representatives have been working with Adidas on a logo since mid-July. It was not ready until late October. Photo N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman, third from the left, at a news conference in February 2015 in which Las Vegas officials announced a season-ticket drive to gauge interest for an expansion team. Credit Ethan Miller/Getty Images “Everyone has an opinion, I can tell you that,” Foley said in an interview this month. “I was trying to do consensus-building for a while; then I stopped.” If people do not like the name, he added, “it’s going to be on me.” Foley at least has some company in decision-making now. After the Las Vegas ownership group, which includes the Maloof family, the former owners of the Sacramento Kings, received permission from the N.H.L. to conduct a season-ticket drive to gauge interest in December 2014, Foley worked with a small group of advisers and ticket representatives. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Now Foley has cleared out a floor in an office building in Summerlin, a suburb 15 miles from the Strip, for his growing staff, which he described as around 20 “poor people living in little cubes.” He said he had not wanted to spend money or risk capital before the team was awarded, so the past five months have been a sprint. The first major hire was that of General Manager George McPhee, who was the Washington Capitals’ general manager from 1997 to 2014. After assuming his position in July, he put together an hockey operations staff of nearly 40 people, including scouts, video specialists and an analytics department, in 60 days. Photo George McPhee, left, being named general manager of the Las Vegas expansion franchise in July, with Bill Foley, the team’s owner. Credit John Locher/Associated Press The franchise has just started building its business side. Kerry Bubolz, a longtime executive with the Cleveland Cavaliers, was named team president on Oct. 3. A chief marketing officer, Nehme E. Abouzeid, came aboard on Nov. 7. The infrastructure of a major professional team also is becoming more visible in Las Vegas. The first ice sheet was installed at T-Mobile Arena on July 30 — a 110-degree day. In early October, the arena, which seats 17,368, hosted a fan festival and its first two N.H.L. games, preseason contests featuring the Los Angeles Kings. In October, the team broke ground on a practice facility in downtown Summerlin that is expected to be completed in August in time for training camp. The team website changed from VegasWantsHockey.com to VegasIsHockey.com . The team’s Twitter feed has been humming with updates, counting down the days until the name announcement, sharing hockey history and promoting local hockey scene, including Nevada-Las Vegas games. Todd Pollock, the vice president for ticketing, and his staff spent most of the past six weeks trying to convert the nearly 16,000 season-ticket deposits into actual season-ticket holders, and managing online seat selection. Photo Foley accepted a silver hockey stick from the Kings before a preseason game last month that was part of a fan festival at T-Mobile Arena. Credit David Becker/Associated Press “Phones are ringing nonstop,” he said. For a brief period, Pollock constituted the team’s entire ticket sales staff. Pollock, who has worked for the Los Angeles Kings and the San Francisco 49ers, has been part of the operation since Foley obtained approval from the N.H.L. for the ticket drive. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “It’s an education process for some of them,” Pollock said of Las Vegas residents. “They love hockey. They just don’t know much about it.” Pollock’s ticket-sales staff has grown to 10 people. They have come a long way from cold-calling bars, restaurants and community centers to “invite themselves over” to sell residents on the team, Pollack said. Foley said that sometimes only 15 to 20 people would show up at a bar. But when 4,000 deposits were made on the first day of the drive, Foley said he thought, “Wow, people really want this.” The team converted a strong majority of deposits into season tickets, selling about 13,800 season tickets, Foley said. Photo The Las Vegas team’s name and logo will be revealed in a ceremony outside T-Mobile Arena on the Las Vegas Strip. Credit Ethan Miller/Getty Images “Las Vegas is so ready to have its own thing other than the Strip,” he said. While he acknowledged his team may have to share the city with the Oakland Raiders after they recently reached a stadium deal with the state , Foley noted that the Raiders are not owned by local residents and come with a pre-existing fan base. While others try to build a fan base, McPhee is try to build a team, with the expansion draft scheduled for June 17 to 20 and the amateur draft three days later. He expects to spend the next several months dividing time between Las Vegas and the road, getting his staff together once a month to review nuts and bolts. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story McPhee’s analytics group is pouring over statistics of every professional team and every minor league team to rate players and build a database. His crew of scouts are watching 25 games a night, canvassing all the N.H.L. teams and determining the best prospects in the amateur ranks. “We do feel like we are in a good rhythm right now,” McPhee said. McPhee and his staff are trying to do a mock expansion draft each month after doing their first in November, which produced questions for the league about the rules of the expansion draft.

    "text": "Continue reading the main story “That was invented by enemies of the people, enemies of our state, who know that as long as I am in the Caucasus, the Western, European special services will not manage to change the situation here,” he says, riffing on the official conviction that the West seeks to engineer regime change in Russia. “That is why they want to make the Russian people have a bad attitude toward me. They want to make an enemy of the people out of me. On the contrary, people run to me. They hug me.” \nAdvertisement Mr. Kadyrov, 40, is clearly getting a hug from the Kremlin, with state-run television running what amounts to a weekly infomercial. The reason for it is less obvious. The first possible reason is economic. Chechnya, with a population of 1.4 million, costs the Kremlin about $1 billion in annual subsidies, the RBC newspaper calculated. Moscow recently announced that persistent economic problems meant the republic would face federal budget cuts like all government entities. The show appears aimed at persuading more investors and Russian tourists to open their wallets in Chechnya so that Moscow will not have to. “I thought soldiering was the most difficult part, but attracting investment is,” Mr. Kadyrov laments in one episode, bragging about his role in fighting Russian forces before his father led the clan to switch sides. The show may also be an attempt to groom Mr. Kadyrov for a national role. “They are aware of the experience of Trump; they are aware of the experience of other people who have used media stereotypes for their political careers,” said Grigory S. Shvedov, the editor of Caucasian Knot , a web-based news service. “This is clearly political P.R.” “The Team” depicts Mr. Kadyrov, often dressed in various shades of camouflage, as a kind of cuddly teddy bear. He expounds on all manner of village traditions and his own biography: what he learned at his father’s knee, how he wooed his wife, why he loves trees. At the same time, speaking in staccato, heavily accented Russian, he dispenses a stream of action-hero philosophy, like the belief that any man should be able to ride a horse, shoot a weapon and swim. With Russia marketing itself globally as the anti-Western beacon and the home of conservative values, Mr. Kadyrov is portrayed as a charismatic man rooted in family, nature and tradition. He is “absolutely not a radical,” gushes a contestant named Andrei, a 31-year-old businessman from Moscow. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In many ways, “The Team” follows a standard reality show format. The contestants, mostly Russians with marketing experience, are divided into two teams and compete in every episode to fulfill a task, like producing a video promoting Chechnya. They make scathing remarks about one another, and Mr. Kadyrov sends at least one packing weekly, scrawling the person’s name with a gold pen. Various Russian politicians and pop stars make cameo appearances, developing a side competition in praising Mr. Kadyrov. What distinguishes the show is that it stars a compelling character working hard to drown his brutal reputation in a tidal wave of charm. Persistent Islamic militancy and Mr. Kadyrov’s own Islamization campaign are glossed over. Here he is releasing a herd of deer into the wild; there, collecting a wildflower bouquet . When not showing various gilded, marbled meeting rooms, the producers intersperse gorgeous shots of Chechnya, using drone footage that caresses glittering new skyscrapers, soaring mountains, pristine lakes and historic stone towers. All that is missing is Mr. Kadyrov bursting into the theme song from “The Sound of Music.” “It creates an image of a person and a republic that does not exist,” said Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, who analyzes the Caucasus for the International Crisis Group. “The business, political and social environment that we are being shown is just shocking compared to the reality.” Chechens are accustomed to seeing Mr. Kadyrov on local television. First, he uses it to flaunt his daily doings. Second, in a far grimmer reality, he seeks to stamp out dissent by publicly humiliating anyone who dares utter even vague criticism of his rule. are Abuse is rife, as a recent Human Rights Watch report detailed. Worse happens off camera: Critics disappear, and some turn up dead. Bloodshed is not limited to Chechnya. Chechen security forces have been linked to assassinations in Russia and abroad. The most recent was the killing of Boris Y. Nemtsov , a leading Putin critic gunned down near the Kremlin in February 2015. The Chechen leader targets journalists in particular. In September, Zhalaudi Geriev, a reporter for Caucasian Knot, was jailed for three years for possessing marijuana. His lawyer said that the drugs had been planted and that a confession had been extracted under torture. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Some nongovernmental organizations no longer feel safe holding conferences in Chechnya, so they host them in Moscow, where critics can speak freely. “In the Chechen republic, there is an unwritten law: It is called ‘Ramzan said,’ and it is above all other law,” said one participant in a conference on women’s rights this year, not wanting to be named out of fear of violent retribution. Inevitably, some actual reality creeps into the show. The four women among the 16 contestants on “The Team” were quickly eliminated. “Women are natural housewives,” Mr. Kadyrov says. Mr. Kadyrov also supports polygamy in Chechnya, even though it is illegal in Russia. He communicates with the world mostly through Instagram, where he has more than two million followers. One way he drives traffic, opponents say, is by forcing every government entity to open an account and “like” all his posts. The show makes light of some sinister Chechen practices. Chechens have a reputation for using thugs with guns to seize lucrative businesses, for example, even in Moscow. At one point, the M.C. tells Mr. Kadyrov what a successful businessman Andrei is in Moscow. The contestant scoffs at the compliment. “Don’t worry, we are not going to take it away from you,” Mr. Kadyrov responds to widespread laughter. Television critics pan the show for treating Mr. Kadyrov with kid gloves. They accuse the boyishly handsome, blond M.C., Boris Korchevnikov, a Russia talk show host, of acting like a puppy. Similar comments pop up on social media, but there are also those who hail Mr. Kadyrov as a “hero of Russia.” The show is not among the 100 most-watched programs on Russian TV, but it does O.K. for its late-night slot. Rossiya 1, the channel that broadcasts it, declined requests to interview Mr. Korchevnikov or to witness any filming in Chechnya. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Whatever the purpose of “The Team,” most analysts will tell you that the barriers to Mr. Kadryov’s becoming the president of Russia are just too high for a Muslim and non-ethnic Russian. Mr. Putin has no anointed heir, however, and some imagine that if a succession proves chaotic, Mr. Kadyrov could swoop in with his 20,000-strong Praetorian Guard and claim to impose order for the good of all Russia. Repeated wars in the North Caucasus have inspired generations of Russian artists, from Mikhail Lermontov to Leo Tolstoy to the modern writer Zakhar Prilepin. They helped to typecast the region in the Russian psyche as eternally violent, and it is not clear that one reality show can erase that. The more lasting impression might be summarized by a Lermontov poem titled “To the Caucasus,” which begins: “Caucasus! A land far away! Home to a simple freedom! And you are full of sorrows and stained with the blood of war…” \nFollow Neil MacFarquhar on Twitter @NeilMacFarquhar . \nIvan Nechepurenko and Oleg Matsnev contributed reporting. ",

Dunes and sand ripples of various shapes and sizes display the natural beauty created by physical processes. The area covered in the image is about six-tenths of a mile (1 kilometer) across. Sand dunes are among the most widespread wind-formed features on Mars. Their distribution and shapes are affected by changes in wind direction and wind strength. Patterns of dune erosion and deposition provide insight into the sedimentary history of the surrounding terrain. This image obtained by the framing camera on NASA's Dawn spacecraft shows the south pole of the giant asteroid Vesta. Scientists are discussing whether the circular structure that covers most of this image originated by a collision with another asteroid, or by internal processes early in the asteroid's history. Images in higher resolution from Dawn's lowered orbit might help answer that question. The image was recorded with the framing camera aboard NASA's Dawn spacecraft from a distance of about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers). The image resolution is about 260 meters per pixel. This undated photo shows a classic type 1a supernova remnant. Researchers Saul Perlmutter and Adam Riess of the United States and US-Australian Brian Schmidt won the 2011 Nobel Physics Prize on October 4, 2011 for their research on supernovae. A quartet of Saturn's moons, from tiny to huge, surround and are embedded within the planet's rings in this Cassini composition. Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is in the background of the image, and the moon's north polar hood is clearly visible. See PIA08137 to learn more about that feature on Titan (3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers across). Next, the wispy terrain on the trailing hemisphere of Dione (698 miles, or 1,123 kilometers across) can be seen on that moon which appears just above the rings at the center of the image. See PIA10560 and PIA06163 to learn more about Dione's wisps. Saturn's small moon Pandora (50 miles, or 81 kilometers across) orbits beyond the rings on the right of the image. Finally, Pan (17 miles, or 28 kilometers across) can be seen in the Encke Gap of the A ring on the left of the image. The image was taken in visible blue light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 17, 2011. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers) from Dione and at a Sun-Dione-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 27 degrees. Image scale is 8 miles (13 kilometers) per pixel on Dione. Combining almost opposite ends of the electromagnetic spectrum, this composite image of the Herschel in far-infrared and XMM-Newton's X-ray images obtained January 20, 2012, shows how the hot young stars detected by the X-ray observations are sculpting and interacting with the surrounding ultra-cool gas and dust, which, at only a few degrees above absolute zero, is the critical material for star formation itself. Both wavelengths would be blocked by Earth's atmosphere, so are critical to our understanding of the lifecycle of stars . (AFP / Getty Images) Resembling looming rain clouds on a stormy day, dark lanes of dust crisscross the giant elliptical galaxy Centaurus A. Hubble's panchromatic vision, stretching from ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths, reveals the vibrant glow of young, blue star clusters and a glimpse into regions normally obscured by the dust. (NASA / ESA / Hubble Heritage) A bubbling cauldron of star birth is highlighted in this image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. Infrared light that we can't see with our eyes has been color-coded, such that the shortest wavelengths are shown in blue and the longest in red. The middle wavelength range is green. Massive stars have blown bubbles, or cavities, in the dust and gas--a violent process that triggers both the death and birth of stars. The brightest, yellow-white regions are warm centers of star formation. The green shows tendrils of dust, and red indicates other types of dust that may be cooler, in addition to ionized gas from nearby massive stars. This composite image shows the central region of the spiral galaxy NGC 4151. X-rays (blue) from the Chandra X-ray Observatory are combined with optical data (yellow) showing positively charged hydrogen (H II) from observations with the 1-meter Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope on La Palma. The red ring shows neutral hydrogen detected by radio observations with the NSF's Very Large Array. This neutral hydrogen is part of a structure near the center of NGC 4151 that has been distorted by gravitational interactions with the rest of the galaxy, and includes material falling towards the center of the galaxy. The yellow blobs around the red ellipse are regions where star formation has recently occurred. (NASA / CXC / CfA / J. Wang) \"These tidal tails are thin, elongated streams of gas, dust and stars that extend away from a galaxy into space. They occur when galaxies gravitationally interact with one another, and material is sheared from the outer edges of each body and flung out into space in opposite directions, forming two tails. They almost always appear curved, so when they are seen to be relatively straight, as in this image, it is clear that we are viewing the galaxies side-on.\" This image provided by NASA shows the Solar Dynamic Observatory's ultra-high-definition view of Venus, black dot at top center, passing in front of the sun on Tuesday, June 5, 2012.

(NASA/Solar Dynamic Observatory/AP) WISE, NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, has a new view of Barnard 3, or IRAS Ring G159.6-18.5, that is awash in bright green and red dust clouds. Interstellar clouds like these are stellar nurseries, where baby stars are being born. (UCLA / JPL-Caltech / NASA) Feel like you are being watched? This infrared image from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope shows the Helix nebula, a cosmic starlet notable for its vivid colors and eerie resemblance to a giant eye. In visible light, the star-forming cloud known as NGC 281 in the constellation of Cassiopeia appears to be chomping through the cosmos, earning it the nickname the \"Pacman\" nebula after the famous Pac-Man video game of the 1980s. This undated handout image provide by NASA combines data from four different space telescopes to create a multi-wavelength view of all that remains of the oldest documented example of a supernova, called RCW 86. NASA announced the findings Monday, Oct. 24, 2011, and said the exploded star was observed by the ancient Chinese in the year 185, and visible for eight months. This image provided by NASA shows a night time image photographed by the Expedition 29 crew from the International Space Station on Oct. 16, 2011. It features airglow, Earth's terminator, Rocky Mountains, Denver-Colorado Springs (center-right), Santa Fe-Albuquerque (low-center-right), US Great Plains cities: Dallas-Oklahoma City, Kansas City and Chicago. This image provided by NASA shows the image captured by Hinode on June 5, 2012 of the transit of Venus -- the last instance of this rare phenomenon until 2117. Hinode is a joint JAXA/NASA mission to study the connections of the sun's surface magnetism, primarily in and around sunspots. NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., manages Hinode. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., is the lead U.S. investigator for the X-ray Telescope.

Messier 78 Nebula brings into focus a murky region of star formation. NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope exposes the depths of this dusty nebula with its infrared vision, showing stellar infants that are lost behind dark clouds when viewed in visible light. Messier 78 is easily seen in small telescopes in the constellation of Orion An image released on October 3, 2011 show the Antennae Galaxies (also known as NGC 4038 and 4039) are a pair of distorted colliding spiral galaxies about 70 million light-years away, in the constellation of Corvus (The Crow). This view combines Atacama large milllimetre/submillimetre array (ALMA) observations, made in three different wavelength ranges during the observatory's early testing phase, with visible-light observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. Most of the ALMA test observations used to create this image were made using only twelve antennas working together -- far fewer than will be used for the first science observations. The first phase of operations at the ALMA complex in Chile's Atacama desert are underway on October 3, 2011 following ten years of construction. Alma's purpose is to study processes occurring a few hundred million years after the formation of the Universe when the first stars began to shine. Alma consists of an array of linked giant antennas on top of the highest plateau in the Atacama desert.

In visible light, the region resembles North America, but in this image infrared view from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, the continent disappears. In this undated image taken by the WISE telescope a massive star is shown plowing through space dust. The result is a brilliant bow shock, seen here as a yellow arc. At 5:20 a.m. EDT on March 29,2011, the Messenger probe captured this historic image of Mercury. The image is the first ever obtained from a spacecraft in orbit of the solar system's innermost planet. (NASA) The full moon rises near the Lincoln Memorial on March 19 in Washington. The full moon was called a \"Super Perigee Moon\" since it was at its closest to Earth in 2011. The last full moon so big and close to Earth occurred in March 1993. (Bill Ingalls, NASA / AFP / Getty Images) This image from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, or WISE, features a region of star birth wrapped in a blanket of dust, colored green in this infrared view. Designated as LBN 149.02-00.13, this interstellar cloud is made up of a shell of ionized gas surrounding a void with an extremely hot, bright star in the middle. (UCLA / JPL-Caltech / NASA) This image from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows portions of the Martian surface in unprecedented detail. The photo shows many channels from 1 meter to 10 meters wide (approximately 3 feet to 33 feet wide) on a scarp in the Hellas impact basin. Some larger channels on Mars that are sometimes called gullies are big enough to be called ravines on Earth. (NASA / AFP / Getty Images) Saturn's largest moon, Titan, center, is 3,200 miles in diameter. The smaller moon Enceladus, far right, just over 300 miles across, appears just below the rings. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera at a distance of approximately 524,000 miles from Titan. (SSI / JPL / NASA) The space shuttle Discovery is seen from the International Space Station as the two orbital spacecraft accomplish their relative separation. During a post undocking fly-around, the crew of each vessel photographed the opposing craft. (NASA) This NASA image shows what the Hubble Space Telescope revealed in a majestic disk of stars and dust lanes in the spiral galaxy NGC 2841. A bright cusp of starlight marks the galaxy's center. Spiraling outward are dust lanes that are silhouetted against the population of whitish middle-aged stars. Much younger blue stars trace the spiral arms. NGC 2841 lies 46 million light-years away in the constellation of Ursa Major (The Great Bear). (Hubble Heritage / ESA / NASA) This image obtained by NASA's Stardust spacecraft shows Comet Tempel 1 at 11:39 p.m. EST on Feb. 14, 2011. The NASA spacecraft's flyby of the comet showed erosion on Tempel 1's surface since it skimmed by the sun in 2005 and revealed the first clear pictures of the crater made by a Deep Impact probe. (Cornell / JPL-Caltech / NASA) A pair of active regions on the sun were captured in extreme ultraviolet light from the Solar Dynamic Observatory spacecraft over a three-day period. The magnetic field lines above the regions produced fluttering arcs waving above them, as well as a couple of flares. Another pair of smaller active regions emerges and trails behind the larger ones. (Solar Dynamics Observatory / NASA) This view of the North America nebula combines both visible and infrared light observations, taken by the Digitized Sky Survey and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, respectively, into a single vivid picture. The nebula is named after its resemblance to the North American continent in visible light, which in this image is represented in blue hues. Infrared light, displayed here in red and green, can penetrate deep into the dust, revealing multitudes of hidden stars and dusty clouds. This still caught the action in freeze-frame splendor when the sun popped off two events at once. A filament, left, became unstable and erupted, while an M-1 flare and a coronal mass ejection, right, blasted into space. Neither event was headed toward Earth. This image shows a dramatic view of the spiral galaxy M51, dubbed the Whirlpool Galaxy. Seen in near-infrared light, most of the starlight has been removed, revealing the Whirlpool's skeletal dust structure. This image is the sharpest view of the dense dust in M51. The narrow lanes of dust revealed by Hubble reflect the galaxy's moniker, the Whirlpool Galaxy, as if they were swirling toward the galaxy's core. While searching the skies for black holes using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, astronomers discovered a giant supernova that was smothered in its own dust in this image released on Jan. 14. In this artist's rendering, an outer shell of gas and dust -- which erupted from the star hundreds of years ago -- obscures the supernova within. This event in a distant galaxy hints at one possible future for the brightest star system in our own Milky Way. Mars' two moons have been photographed in the same frame for the first time. The European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter snapped this image, which was released Dec. 11, 2009. The larger moon is Phobos. The much smaller one is Deimos. Scientists said Dec. 8, 2009, that the Hubble Space Telescope spotted several thousand never-before-seen galaxies that were formed 600 million years after the Big Bang. Here, a photo shows some of them. They appear in the image as the faintest and reddest objects. This is one of the most detailed images to date of the heart of the Milky Way. The galaxy's center is within the white spot near the right edge of the photo. NASA released the image Nov. 10 to mark the 400th anniversary of the telescope. It is a composite of images from three observatories: the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. This Hubble Space Telescope image shows an object known as both NGC 2623 and Arp 243, which was formed by a collision of two galaxies. The galaxies' cores have merged into one; the tails streaming from the object are full of young stars. NGC 2623 is about 250 million light-years away in the constellation of Cancer. This portrait of Barnard's Galaxy, one of the Milky Way's closest neighbors, was taken by a telescope at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile. The red features in the photo are nebulae where new stars are being born. The galaxy has about 10 million stars; the Milky Way has an estimated 400 billion. The Cassini spacecraft became the first to photograph an equinox on Saturn, a 15-year event that took place Aug. 11. This photo is a composite of images that Cassini shot over eight hours. New equinox images of the planet show strange formations in its rings and suggest that in some places, the rings are much thicker than expected. Clumps of debris cast shadows that are visible in the middle of this image of Saturn's A ring. The shadows suggest that the clumps are about 2,000 feet tall. Scientists have believed for years that the rings were about 30 feet thick, but based on the new images, scientists now think that they're more than 2 miles deep in some spots. \"Isn't that the most outrageous thing you could imagine? It truly is like something out of science fiction,\" said Carolyn Porco, leader of the Cassini imaging team. This composite image of Arp 147, a pair of interacting galaxies located about 430 million light-years from Earth, shows X-rays from the NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory (pink) and optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope (red, green, blue) produced by the Space Telescope Science Institute. Arp 147 contains the remnant of a spiral galaxy, right, that collided with the elliptical galaxy on the left. This collision has produced an expanding wave of star formation that shows up as a blue ring containing an abundance of massive young stars. These stars race through their evolution in a few million years or less and explode as supernovas, leaving behind neutron stars and black holes. A new photo released in July from the Hubble Space Telescope is the clearest yet of what astronomers are calling a scar on the surface of Jupiter. An object, possibly a comet, struck the planet recently, creating the strange dark patch. It happened on the 15th anniversary of another comet strike. This planetary nebula, named Kohoutek 4-55, was photographed May 4 by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. The nebula, dubbed a \"giant eye,\" contains the outer layers of a red giant star that died. The camera, which is the size of a baby grand piano, has captured several memorable images since it was installed in 1993. In this sequence of photos released in April, a jet of gas spews from a massive black hole in the center of the M87 galaxy. The gas fades and brightens, with a peak that even outshines the galaxy's core. The outburst is coming from a blob of matter, dubbed HST-1, and scientists are so far at a loss to explain its weird behavior. This photo was snapped by the Hubble Space Telescope after winning a public competition to determine what the next space portrait should be. It shows Arp 274, a system of three galaxies -- two larger ones on the right, and a smaller and less intact one on the far left. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of three galaxies playing a game of gravitational tug-of-war that could destroy one of them. The galaxies -- NGC 7173, middle left, NGC 7174, middle right, and NGC 7176, lower right -- are about 100 million light-years away. The photo was released March 3. Our solar system is in the middle of a cosmic dust storm, and some astronomers said they've zeroed in on the possible source: the Red Rectangle nebula, which is 2,300 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros. A double star system there is spewing the dust, according to findings announced in February. After transmission problems on the Hubble Telescope weren fixed, NASA in October 2008 provided this undated photograph showing the aftermath of galaxies colliding. In the pair known as Arp 147, a reddish-colored galaxy has passed through an O-shaped galaxy glowing blue. Photographs taken of Mercury by the spacecraft Messenger in January 2008 were analyzed in the journal Science seven months later. Images like the one above show that volcanic activity played a part in forming plains on the planet. Even galaxies get bullied. Here, a so-called \"death star galaxy\" blasts a nearby galaxy with a jet of energy. Scientists said that if this happened in the Milky Way, it would likely destroy all life on Earth. In 2005, NASA's Hubble Telescope captured this image of the Crab Nebula, a six-light-year-wide expanding remnant of a star's supernova explosion. Japanese and Chinese astronomers witnessed this violent event in 1054. US National Reconnaissance Office unexpectedly transferred control of two Hubble-quality satellites to NASA in June of 2012.

    "text": "Home / Product Round-ups / Mobile Phones / Best Cheap Mobile Phones and Budget Smartphones 2016 Best Cheap Mobile Phones and Budget Smartphones 2016 \nby Max Parker Read Comments \nIf you're looking for a cheap mobile phone best budget smartphone or cheap Android phones, you've come to the right place. Our round-up features only the top examples, so you can choose in confidence. \nOver the last year we’ve tried some of our favourite phones ever. From sublime all-rounders like the Samsung Galaxy S7 to the gorgeously crafted HTC 10 , to interesting beasts, like the modular LG G5 and Leica camera-equipped Huawei P9 . There's also the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 , which is great but prone to exploding, and of course the recently announced Pixel phones direct from Google. \nBut, these high-end phones naturally come with wallet-busting price-tags and that instantly means they’re not for everyone. But fear not, even though the high-end market is better than ever, so is the budget range. In stores today there are a variety of great value for money smartphones that will meet 99% of people’s needs. We’ve got the latest stunner from Moto, a couple of bargains from China and even a few surprises along the way. \nWATCH: Is the Moto G4 the best budget phone? This week's best budget smartphones deals \nXiaomi Redmi Note 3 at Amazon.com | Was $220 | Now $194 \nHere to help buyers on a budget pick which is best for them, we’ve created the definitive list detailing the best value for money smartphones currently available. \nHit the 'Next' arrow or use the dropdown to start viewing the list, or read on for more buying advice. CHEAP SMARTPHONES VS FLAGSHIP PHONES: What’s the difference? \nFlagship smartphones are becoming more expensive by the year, but finding a good mobile is actually cheaper than ever. What’s more, cheap phones aren’t anywhere near as basic as they used to be. That said, what are the real differences? \nRelated: Best Mobile Deals: Top Smartphone offers this month \nDesign isn't necessarily one of them. Thanks to design and build quality improvements, you won’t feel like you’re carrying a brick around with you. Manufacturers such as Huawei, Motorola, Asus and ZTE have really raised the bar in this regard. You also don’t have to sacrifice features like 4G and NFC when buying a budget phone. \nThere’s a lot to smile about in the photography department too. Several of the smartphones in this list are equipped with HDR-enabled cameras, which could previously only be found on more expensive models. Cheap mobile phones tend to struggle more in challenging conditions, such as low light and in action scenes, but the ones in our round-up are all good general-purpose camera phones. \nHowever, there are certain things you'll have to make do without, like a QHD display, for instance. Instead, 1080p and 720p screens are the order of the day. They're not as sharp as what you’ll find on the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge or similar, but they’re still a big improvement over the display we had a few years ago. \nProcessing power is another department that usually takes a hit, but several of the smartphones in this round-up are still great for playing high-end games on. \nRead more: Mobile Phone Buyer's Guide \nCrucially, cheap smartphones get access to the same app stores as their more expensive counterparts, so you can download as many apps and games as your hardware can handle. If you do plan to download lots of apps, though, make sure you get a phone with a microSD card slot as many cheap phones have limited built-in storage. \nThe one thing you won't find, however, is a cheap iPhone – not unless you buy second-hand. If you must have an iPhone, we'd recommend getting an iPhone 5S or the iPhone SE. How cheap? \nAll the phones on the list are priced below £200, with a couple coming in sub-£150 and even less than £100. Be warned though: A lot of phones we review under £100 are basically unusable thanks to meagre amounts of RAM, slow write speeds and low internal storage. If you can spend a little more, you’ll get a much better experience that’ll most likely last longer. What should I avoid? \nDon’t even bother with anything with less than 1GB RAM and 8GB storage, and try to go for something with 2GB RAM at least. Without this, you’ll notice far more app crashes and slow performance. The higher the internal storage the better, too, especially if you want to install apps and games. High-end and graphically intensive games like Asphalt 8 takes up about 2GB, so you’ll barely be able to fit that on to an 8GB phone. xtvst May 16, 2015, 5:27 pm \nMoto G has an incredibly fragile display. Mine fell off of my pockey while I was sitting for dinner. The lcd display inside cracked. I had never dropped the phone before. Although there are tons of users facing the same problem, Motorola wont take responsibility by their faulty project and warranty won't cover it.Wont fix it because 1. it will still be fragile and will obviously crack again at any smaller impact, 2. Theres a big chance I will get a chinese quality lcd display/touchscreen replacement while paying half of the phone's price for the fix up.Is it a good device? Absolutely. But only buy it if you're Neil Armstrong (RIP) planning to use it in mission. Otherwise the budget you invested for the lots-of-benefits provided by MotoG turns to nothing. leadpb May 18, 2015, 3:20 pm \nGot my Moto G last September. Thought it was excellent until charging problems occurred. had to go through a process of holding power and volume buttons to resume charging. This kept on happening over a couplle of weeks. Customer services were good but told to run phone down to zero power which I did. Phone died completely. Online comments reveal that others have suffered similar problems so maybe mine is not an isolated problem and a fault with the phone which others had complained about. Maybe updated models wouldn't have this flaw but shame as its ruined what I thought was an excellent and good value phone. ElectricSheep May 27, 2015, 2:43 pm \nI think that at £200, the Nokia 830 should be considered. I've been using one after my Nexus packed up. Whilst I still dislike the WP8.1 tiles look (vastly improved with active tiles and folders), the OS is excellent these days and the hardware and build quality are second to none. The camera is superb. I thought i'd hate it and go back to Android in days, but I actually like it! Phil_C May 29, 2015, 11:44 am \nSeriously, you guys need to check out the Prestigio 8500 duo. We have 3 of them in my household. They are £100 each, battery lasts 2 days plus and down slow down or break down in our experience. I had never heard of them before a Windows Server offer from ebuyer, but now they are a firm favourite. ichuck7 June 1, 2015, 5:17 am \nWhere would the Sharp Aquous Crystal fit on this list? It's one of the only budget smartphones that looks really cool. Amy June 21, 2015, 5:40 pm \nMy daughter got that phone she said it was crap and took it back ichuck7 June 21, 2015, 6:21 pm \nWhy did she say it was crap? I'm genuinely curious. Were her expectations too high? Did she compare it to a $700 iPhone? Robert Daniels June 24, 2015, 3:20 pm \nMy general advice for budget devices is to buy last year's flagship on the secondhand market. You can pick up something like the DROID Turbo or HTC M8 for ~$200. Much better values, in my opinion. \nEDIT: and maybe even a two year old flagship for the ultra budget conscious, but only if the battery is replaceable. Jared Jeanquart September 9, 2015, 5:06 pm \nIt runs well and holds a huge sd card, and has more ram than usual for stuff in its class. Earpiece Phone calls sound slightly tinny, and you have to mash the phone to your ear; a problem for old people. I know someone who has one, and I've sold a few. One was returned. \nBattery's unexceptional. \nIt's a very serviceable phone for the budget-conscious. The huge SD card potential is a big deal; you could fit a huge music/video library on it. \nIt's intended for the Asian market. The components are very reliable; needs a screen protector, but will last for a LONG time. iFrank March 19, 2016, 1:04 pm \nMay be referenced in the full review but the Honor 5X has a rare attribute, that is a Micro SD slot as well as dual sim provision.I didn't find the overlaying skin a problem but an asset, just like Touchwiz is on some older Samsung's despite reviewers, who mostly do not live with these phones constantly declaring their love for naked android. \nI returned mine because of not having NFC and the bother of two sizes of sim card being needed. One micro, one nano. \nI hate nano even more than C type plug leads.Apart from being smaller (a probable DIS advantage) there are no discernable advantages for the existence of nano sim cards. Unless you think the blessings by Apple is a Pro.Cat- pidgeons. April 18, 2016, 4:25 pm \nBest budget phone is Huwaei Honor 5X from amazon £160. fcabanski May 8, 2016, 10:32 pm \nThese are expensive. Oh well, what can be expected from RT euros? H Baker May 31, 2016, 1:55 pm \nPersonally I would recommend a Ulefone Paris. Cosmin Dinu June 21, 2016, 3:38 pm \nCubot, Xiaomi, Umi those phones are cheaper and better. Where are they?Moto G phones are awesome indeed, but a bit too expensive imo. Awesome Bryner July 11, 2016, 3:35 am \nPeople do not know what cheap is. Cheap is not expensive. Some people like me can't pay more than $50. How stupid. Dorothy Skoland August 1, 2016, 6:29 pm \nI had the same type of problems Only had phone 3 months apuk101 August 8, 2016, 9:28 pm \nThe Moto G4 Plus is a lovely phone, but the battery life is unbelievably poor. I've returned mine because of this. Staring with a full charge, all background activity off and it being left for 24 hours (i.e. not used for ANYTHING), it had only10% battery left after the 24 hours. My old iPhone 5s - and no, I'm not an Apple fan - will do the same for 8 days,, and my iPhone SE - which I actually use as my main phone - lasts 2 days between charges. \nSo the Moto G4 Plus is fatally flawed, in my opinion, which came as a real disappointment to me. Kent Bayley September 9, 2016, 12:51 am \nThis presenter cannot speak properly and rushes his words so he is almost incomprehensible. I strongly suggest he gets some on camera tyraing.

Loganberry October 31, 2016, 1:29 am \nI hear you -- it's so frustrating when you're looking to see what you can get for £50 (I'm in the UK) and 90% of roundups say something like \"going for the [whatever] at £150 really is worth it\". Well, yeah, I'm sure -- but that's precisely zero use if you need a phone quickly and don't have £150! If a site did a \"What's the best phone for £50?\" roundup that didn't repeatedly hammer you with how you need to spend more to get anything usable, I'd be all over it. \nI mean, I bought a ZTE Blade Q Mini back in 2014 for £50 from Argos, largely because it was the only phone I could find at that price that had an IPS display. For my needs (simple browsing, Google Maps, Twitter, MP3s, the odd video or casual game) it was absolutely fine once unlocked. I want a roundup comparing the 2016 equivalents of that phone, not one telling me I should be spending three times as much! rastech November 10, 2016, 3:00 pm \nI lost my BlackBerry phones when my boat went down (along with everything else) and needed to get two usable phones fast (one in America, an LG flip from K-Mart, another as soon as back in the UK) and ALMOST in your price range, I managed to get a SIM free Moto E 2nd gen from Tesco on offer. It was £79.99 if I had it with a Tesco sim (and locked to Tesco), and £57 SIM free (grins).This has turned out to be a cracking phone, well built, great battery life if you turn off unnecessary power hogs, and I easily get 2 days with wifi constantly on. It's also small enough to be good in the pocket, and has an excellent screen with gorilla glass. It auto updated to Android 6.0.1 as soon as I got it, and runs it smoothly. Batteries are removable (I later bought a spare, but have never run out of power and needed to use it), and it has a microSD card slot.Good cheap phones ARE out there, around the £50 mark, and it would be really nice to not have to stumble over them by accident. I think at the time, the Moto E 2nd gen list price was £109 though, so having guide prices may be a really tough challenge on being able to find what we need. Audio with it is very good too (I am almost completely deaf, so this is important), and, it has REAL GPS (also very important to me for Sailsafe anchor watch software and backup Navigation software).My only actual real dislike with the Moto E 2nd gen, applies to all Android and Apple phones though - their touchscreen keyboards really suck big time,especially if you have finger joint problems. So when I am back in a position to get a much better spec phone again, I'll be getting a BlackBerry DTEK 60, to get that fantastic touchscreen keyboard again. With luck, it'll perhaps be a Christmas present.Good luck finding a good phone. Loganberry November 10, 2016, 4:40 pm \nThanks! That Moto E is one I've considered -- annoyingly, I missed a very brief window in which a local Asda had it for £59. Sadly, I haven't seen it for anything like that price since.",

    "text": "By Lindsay Denninger 7 hours ago \nChoosing what boyfriend you wanted Rory to end up with on Gilmore Girls is as personal as who you vote for or what deodorant you use. It’s something that every person has to decide for him or herself. Me? I’m Team Logan . But I have many friends that are Team Jess, and even one or two that are Team Dean (though I don’t know why), and we manage to live happy, healthy lives together. The big question of the Gilmore Girls revival was: who does Rory end up with in the Gilmore Girls revival ? Lucky for you, I have your answer. MAJOR GILMORE GIRLS REVIVAL SPOILERS AHEAD. SERIOUSLY, DON'T KEEP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW. \nBut, before I reveal it, let’s take a short walk down memory lane. Rory started the show dating Dean. Then, there was a very, very short Tristan moment (remember Tristan? Ha.), and then Dean again. Then, Jess came to down and blew everything to crap, because what teenage girl could resist a brooding bad boy? Not me, that’s for sure. After Jess and Rory broke up, Dean popped in for a millisecond (long enough for Rory for drop her v-card), but it wasn’t long before Logan came into her life and stayed there through nearly the end of Season 7. \nLogan and Rory broke up toward the end of the series because he proposed, completely out of the blue, and she wasn’t ready to get married. I side with Rory on this one — Rory and Logan were never seen discussing marriage, and I think it’s bizarre to just pop the question to someone when you’ve never said the word “marriage” to them before. Newly single, Rory graduated, only to find herself with a new man — Barack Obama. Rory nabbed a job working on his campaign bus. I always think that she chose herself at the end of Gilmore Girls , but whom did she choose on Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life ? (Don’t worry — it’s not Paul, her new boyfriend who we see once.) \nWell, this is where things get complicated. Rory and Logan had a friends-with-benefits relationship through the revival, even though she had a boyfriend and he was engaged. Not great. Every time she was in London, she would stay there, and they would pretend they were a couple on that continent and not when she was in the States. Eventually, though, Rory and Logan broke their arrangement off, but not after one last night together in a bed-and-breakfast in New Hampshire. [Embed] \nAnd what of Dean and Jess? Rory and Dean saw each other in Doose’s Market, and he has a mess of kids and a wife and lives in Scranton. They had a nice moment, but Dean and Rory are not getting together. Jess, though? Jess gave Rory a lovely pep talk or seven over the course of the revival, and there was definitely a look that said, “I’m not over her” as he gazed at Rory longingly through a window. [Embed] \nBut that’s not it either! Rory ended up with… herself. Oh, and the unborn child she has growing inside of her. Yep, that’s right — Rory Gilmore is pregnant, presumably with Logan’s baby from their last tryst. The show has always been about the mother/daughter relationship, so it does make sense to me (although it is shocking) that Rory would begin to forge her own mother/daughter relationship. As Christopher told Rory, the bond between Lorelai and Rory was always unbreakable, and now Rory will hopefully have the same thing. \nImages: Saeed Adyani/Netflix; Giphy ",

Subsequent versions, like the Game Boy Pocket or the Game Boy Micro, have improved on the original design in smaller and smaller form factors. But hacker Sprite_TM may have all of Nintendo's efforts beat, with a keychain-sized functional Game Boy that he built for the 2016 Hackaday SuperConference . \nAs Hackaday reports , the build was inspired by a tiny Game Boy keychain. But while the original version was only a clock, Sprite_TM was determined to make a fully functional version on that scale. And until someone else comes along with an even smaller version, the hack is probably the smallest functional Game Boy ever built. \nHackaday The screen is a little off, since the original Game Boy has a resolution of 160×144, while the hack uses a 96×64 color OLED display. It runs off a ESP32 chip with integrated Wi-Fi to transfer ROMs to the Game Boy, and even has a speaker built-in, all housed in a custom 3D-printed case. Sprite_TM also had to do some software hacking to get the GNUboy emulator to run on such limited hardware, but at the end of the day, it not only runs Game Boy games, but even Doom. \nThe complete details of the build can be be found on Hackaday 's full video of Sprite_TM's talk describing the project at the Hackaday SuperConference. And if you're interested in building your own, Sprite_TM will be releasing more information on the code and build process on his website soon.",

    "text": "Leah Remini Sheds A Light On Scientology Horror Stories In 'Aftermath' \"We’re hearing the same story over and over again.\" 11/29/2016 05:22 pm ET Stephanie Marcus Senior Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post AE \nLeah Remini has been “making trouble” for the Church of Scientology since she left the controversial religion in 2013 . The former “King of Queens” star outwardly slammed the church before releasing her memoir , Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology, in November 2015, in which she dropped bombshell allegations against high-ranking officials and celebrity members alike. \nAfter telling her own story, the actress still isn’t done speaking out. She’s back with an eight-part docuseries on A&E called “Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath,” which gives a voice to those like her who want the world to know why they no longer call themselves Scientologists. \nNot that the church wants anyone to hear those voices. The church’s opposition to the show is strongly felt via the multiple disclaimers that appear throughout the first episode, disputing many of the statements made by former members. The opposition is one thing, but the way the Church of Scientology expresses its fervent displeasure sets it apart from other religions. \nA preview for the series features Remini reading a letter penned by church spokeswoman Karin Pouw that includes personal and petty jabs at Remini’s celebrity status and the state of her career. “A program about our religion, hosted by Miss. Remini is doomed to be a cheap reality show by a has-been actress now a decade removed from the peak of her career,” the letter reads. “Miss. Remini is a bitter ex-Scientologist she needs to move on with her life instead of pathetically exploiting her former religion, her former friends and other celebrities for money.” \nThe premiere episode, debuting Tuesday, recalls Remini’s own story of growing up in the church, explaining that the “promise of Scientology is that you will reach your full potential in all areas of your life ... Not only are you fixing yourself, but you’re also helping mankind.” \nIt’s an attractive promise, and for years Remini was an active member who publicly promoted the church, this is, until she attended Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’ wedding in 2006. By all accounts, including Remini’s, Cruise and Holmes’ nuptials were “a big deal” and heralded as “the wedding of the century” for the church. That’s why it struck her odd that Shelly Miscavige, the wife of church leader David Miscavige, wasn’t in attendance. She found it even stranger that she was told she shouldn’t be asking about Shelly’s whereabouts. That incident prompted Remini to start questioning the church and researching allegations of abuse from former members, before finally leaving in 2013. \nRemini expected that she’d be able to move on after she wrote her memoir, but said the response from others who had also left the church was overwhelming. Those who’ve seen Alex Gibney’s “ Going Clear ” or Louis Theroux’s “ My Scientology Movie ” will be more than familiar with the onslaught of allegations of physical and sexual abuse and fraud against the church (all of which the organization denies). “Aftermath” invites viewers to hear more of those allegations from people the Church of Scientology now call “heretics.” What’s more, there’s no shortage of them. \n“We’re hearing the same story over and over again,” Remini says in a teaser for future episodes. Under normal circumstances, the same story over eight episodes would make for a tedious and boring show, but “Aftermath” is telling a horror story, and the repetition is powerful. \n“Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath” premieres Tuesday at 10 p.m. EST on A&E. Also on HuffPost",

    "text": "A s a jobcentre adviser I was once told to call in a “customer” to get them on to the Work Programme . I explained that he was about to be admitted to hospital for major surgery, but I was told he must be called, otherwise he would face a sanction that could stop his benefits for four weeks.\nAfter a year in the job, in Braintree, Essex, a demonstrable shift had taken place once the coalition government had settled in. Advisers were encouraged to see every interview as an opportunity to begin the process of sanctions that might suspend or cancel claims, thereby reducing the number of claimants. We were repeatedly told that such extreme measures were used as a benign incentive, to remind people of an alternative to life dependent on benefits. But we weren’t given any evidence that they actually worked.\nNo evidence welfare sanctions work, says National Audit Office Read more \nAnd according to Tuesday’s National Audit Office report , that’s because the Department for Work and Pensions never had any evidence. So it’s been dishonest all along about the reasons for enforcing sanctions. Moreover, it has failed to monitor the devastating effect on thousands of people whose benefits have been withheld. My primary experience was with people on health-related benefits, so I was expected to apply aggressive targets to some of the most vulnerable people in society if they were five minutes late for an interview or failed to apply for enough jobs. Some were literally without food and couldn’t afford heating. Whereas I used to feel I was doing something for clients, I increasingly felt I was getting “ brownie points” for cruelty .\nThe bureaucracy itself seemed deliberately contrived to confuse and distress claimants. This didn’t just affect those dealing with literacy or mental health issues. Many clients, often high-achieving professionals, or people who’d worked all their life – like the eponymous hero in Ken Loach’s film I, Daniel Blake , who suddenly through redundancy or injury for the first time in their lives were forced to claim benefits – found the process just as daunting and humiliating.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest I, Daniel Blake: the trailer for Ken Loach’s Palme d’Or-winner \nPressure on staff to achieve targets was intense. Team meetings often left colleagues in tears. As sickness absence also contributed to office statistics, this increased the stress on staff performance. I was managing a caseload of about 200 customers. However, rather than supporting them into work or training, I was forced to concentrate on trying to find resourceful ways of meeting targets. One colleague was so distressed by the work that she spoke of suicide as a means of protest. I have worked in many stressful jobs, including in education and the NHS, but I had never heard a colleague openly say they had been driven to contemplate suicide. When I was made redundant three years ago due to my own health issues, I was relieved to be out of such a callous system.\nI felt compelled to provide an honest account of issues consistently sensationalised by the popular media. I worked with my friend Angela Howard and writer Jackie Bartlett on a play , about our experiences of the welfare system, called Can This Be England? We wanted it to show how tendencies in wider society and the media to stigmatise and vilify benefits claimants needed to be challenged. The title of the play alluded to our disbelief at how people on benefits were being treated.\nWhy sanction benefits when there’s no proof the harsh approach works? | Anne Perkins Read more \nIt opens with a scene where nosy neighbours spot someone on sickness benefits in the street and assume they must be skiving. Sometimes I think we are turning into a really mean, spying-on-our-neighbourhood, type of society.\nWe performed the play several times last year, and each performance was followed by a discussion when the audience could ask questions about the issues involved and, importantly, to share their own experiences. We’ve since recorded a radio adaptation so more people will be able to hear the characters and their stories. Can This Be England? seems to have affected people by reflecting their own lives, or by making them much more aware of the impact of benefit sanctions.\nI have recently spoken to former colleagues who remain working for the jobcentre and I am in no doubt that the system of earning brownie points towards targets still exists. The reality is that sanctions are used as one-size-fits-all in a system driven by financial and political targets regardless of entitlement and eligibility.\nWe can’t easily stop this, but we can do all we can to bring this inhumanity to light.",

    "text": "GUWAHATI: BJP led Assam government suddenly stumbled upon a fact that High Madrassa teachers in some districts of Assam observe holidays on Friday, despite Sunday being a declared weekly holiday. \n\nAssam education minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Monday, “Recently during a meeting with education officers I found strange thing that government run High Madrassa in three districts which include Lakhimpur, Naogaon, Morigaon observe holiday on Friday, which is unacceptable.” \n\nHe added, “I know that government allows one or one-and-half-hour break to Muslims to offer Namaz on Friday but it is not a holiday. Even when assembly is in session we follow the same practice.” \n\nThe education department has instructed that this practice will be discontinued and there will no holiday on Friday as Sunday is the official holiday. The notice says erring headmasters will be suspended. \n\nSarma said, “There cannot be two laws in this country. In Pakistan and Bangladesh the official holiday is on Friday while in India , United States and Europe Sunday is the weekly holiday.” \n\nFormer minister and Congress leader, Siddique Ahmed reacted and said, “Sarma is saying that Assam is not Pakistan or Bangladesh, meaning Muslims are second class citizens in India. Therefore, Assam's Muslim community will boycott sarma.\" \n\nHe added, \"Himanta is dividing people on religious lines and pitting one community against the other.\" \n\nThe education minister however added no one will be allowed to dishonour the law. “We will reinforce the law and no religious considerations will be allowed to come in the way of implementation of the law.”  ",

    "text": "By Dirk Libbey 21 minutes ago \nOne of the biggest questions coming out of Captain America: Civil War was, exactly what's going to happen to Captain America now that Steve Rogers has essentially turned his back on it? Will there be a new Captain America? If so, who will pick up the mantle? This is not what we expected the answer to be. A photo posted by Sebastian Stan (@imsebastianstan) on Nov 28, 2016 at 12:01pm PST \nThe above image comes from Sebastian Stan's Instagram account and apparently shows the Winter Soldier with his own Captain America style shield. It's mostly metallic in color, which is clearly designed to match Bucky's metal arm. He says it will come in handy, but for what? \nTo be clear, the creator of this shield, Casey McBroom isn't somebody who designs props for Marvel movies. Instead, he produces the shields for cosplayers and people who just want to own screen ready replicas of film props, so Sebastian Stan isn't walking around with an actual prop that we're going to see in Avengers: Infinity War . Having said that, this doesn't mean that there isn't a story reason that the shield wouldn't \"come in handy.\" \nOf course, the idea that the Winter Soldier is going to become the new Captain America seems completely bizarre as things currently stand. Right now Steve Rogers is in hiding to some degree after breaking half the Avengers out of prison. Bucky Barnes is in cold storage in Wakanda as scientists attempt to deprogram him. Even if the latter issue changed, The Winter Soldier is currently persona non grata among the Avengers thanks to that whole killing Tony's Dad thing. \nStill, it's certainly possible that down the road things could end up exactly here. Bucky Barnes has certainly picked up the shield and fought as Captain America in the comics for various reasons. While this change taking place in the short term is unlikely, seeing this change happen down the road is much more possible. We have no idea what the future holds for most of the MCU once the Infinity War concludes. If Steve Rogers is not in a position to take up the shield at that point, it's entirely within the realm of possibility that Sebastian Stan could become the new Captain America. \nOf course, there's also another strong contender for a new Cap if and when that moment happens. Sam Wilson, played by Anthony Mackie in the films, has also been Captain America in the comics. Both actors have been asked about possibly taking on the role in the MCU and both have done an admirable job of avoiding the question . It appears neither would have a problem taking a more prominent role in the franchise, though both have also stopped short of saying they want the job. Unless Sebastian Stan's new toy is his way of saying that now he's ready. Subscribe To Topics You're Interested In close \nSubscribe To Topics You're Interested In I've already subscribed",

    "text": "This is how Black Friday began When it comes to Black Friday shopping, there tend to be two camps: those who can't wait to hit the sales, and those who want nothing to do with the shopping frenzy. For Tracie Fobes, shopping Black Friday is a mother-daughter tradition that starts way before the sun comes up and goes back more than a decade. \n\"We get up and ready to go, and don't get home until we feel like it,\" said Fobes, who lives in a suburb of Kansas City with her husband and three kids. \nThe tradition started in 2003, after Fobes got married and moved to a different city. Her mom would come visit for Thanksgiving, so Black Friday was a chance to spend quality time together. \n\"It's time I just get to spend with her. I get to take my 'mom' and 'wife' hat off, and be the daughter and friend.\" \nRelated: Here's what Amazon is doing for Black Friday \nBlack Friday is one of the biggest shopping days of the year for retailers, but the event has expanded over the years, spilling over into Thanksgiving Day. This year, Macy's ( M ) will open at 5:00 p.m. on Thursday . Toys R Us stores will stay open for 30 hours starting at 5:00 pm on Thanksgiving. \nWhile deals abound on Black Friday, for many shoppers the day is more about spending time together. \n\"It's not the deals that make the day, it's our chance to kick off the holiday season and it's a chance for us to bond and spend time alone,\" said Fobes. \nShe and her mom aim to be out the door around 3:30 in the morning to avoid the large crowds. \"We get the store to ourselves.\" \nTo keep their stamina up for their often 11-hour shopping marathons, they fuel up on the same breakfast each year: a salted caramel hot chocolate and a slice of lemon pound cake from Starbucks. \nFor Christina Strupek, and her daughter, Samantha, shopping on Black Friday is more about bonding than bargains. \"My goal is to get 75-80% of my shopping done by Friday afternoon.\" The pair strategizes their shopping plan the night before, reviewing the ads and how to best tick off the items on their shopping list. \nTo help stay on budget, Fobes sticks to cash. She and her husband save for the holidays for the entire year, and then set a budget. \nRelated: Mall of America will be closed on Thanksgiving (sorta) \nChristina Strupek used to have zero interest in shopping on Black Friday. But this year marks the seventh year she'll hit the sales with her daughter. \n\"I never cared to do it ... I don't like to get up early as it is,\" the mother of two said. \"But she wanted to try it, so I said, ok. The things you do for your kids.\" \nShe and her daughter, who is 20, are firming up this year's plans. \n\"It is a tradition, a bonding thing,\" Strupek said. \"I am not doing this to get out there for the bargain. It's more of a bonding, fun thing for us.\" \nSince snagging deals isn't the priority, Strupek said she doesn't make a shopping list. She barely gets any of her actual holiday shopping done on Black Friday. \n\"It's the start to the holiday season,\" said daughter Samantha. \"It gets us both into the spirit of things. We both love shopping, it's our time. Now that I am away at college, when I come home this is something just the two of us can do together.\" \nHere's how far parents will go to pay for holiday gifts for their gifts \nFor Fobes and her mother, their tradition could be gaining a new member soon. Her 12-year-old daughter has expressed interest in joining the shopping event. \n\"It's a rite of passage.\" \nCNNMoney (New York) First published November 23, 2016: 9:00 AM ET",

By Ryan Rosenblatt Nov 22, 2016 at 2:42p ET 0Shares \nThe United States have hired Bruce Arena to be their new manager (again), but only through the 2018 World Cup. \nThe Americans' previous three managers -- Arena from 1998-2006, Bob Bradley from 2006-2011 and Jurgen Klinsmann from 2011-2015 -- all managed the team for more than one World Cup cycle and all had issues in the second cycle. Arena's team crashed out of the 2006 World Cup group stage, Bradley's team was beaten in the 2011 Gold Cup final and he was fired, and Klinsmann's team had an embarrassing 2015 Gold Cup then lost their first two Hex matches before he was let go. \nOf those three, only Klinsmann was handed a contract through a second World Cup before managing the first World Cup. So in Arena and Bradley's cases, they had to earn a second World Cup and that could happen with Arena in his second stint. But at least for now, he will only be on through 2018. \nThat is welcome news for some fans who thought that Arena may be given a longer contract because he was taking over so late in a World Cup cycle. That could set him up for a problematic second cycle, as the last three U.S. bosses had. But that won't be the case for now. \nMORE FROM FOX SOCCER:",

    "text": "“We learned the hard way after the Carmel fire disaster.\" Fire damage in Halamish.. (photo credit:ANNA AHRONHEIM) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nOne week after brush fires destroyed hundreds of homes and displaced tens of thousands of families in the north and central regions of the country, police on Monday said the most deadly blazes have been extinguished.Since last Tuesday, more than 3,035 hectares (7,500 acres) of forests and 1,090 hectares (2,700 acres) of urban areas have been destroyed by fires in Haifa, Zichron Ya’acov, Neveh Shalom, Modi’in, Neveh Ilan, Nataf and other areas throughout the country, according to Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund’s firefighting services. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Speaking Monday morning at a memorial ceremony at Mount Herzl for soldiers killed in the 1956 Sinai Campaign, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to rebuild the homes that were lost in the fire and replant the forests that were burned.“In the place of every tree that was blackened, another 10 green trees will bloom,” he said. “That is what our predecessors did since the establishment of the Zionist enterprise, and that is what we will do as well: plant, build and deepen our roots.”Netanyahu also spoke of the phone call he had a few days earlier with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, thanking him for sending firefighters to help battle the flames.“This is the right thing to do and I appreciate it,” he said he told Abbas. “Let us not light fires, let us put them out and march together toward peace.”Speaking in the Likud faction meeting on Monday, Netanyahu said Israel knows for certain that some of the fires that have ravaged the country are the result of “criminal and intentional” arson, and repeated that Israel views these acts of arson as acts of terrorism for all intents and purposes, and will deal with them accordingly.There are increasing signs the wildfires were politically motivated, although there is no evidence yet the blazes were coordinated or planned in advance. Multiple police units, aided by the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) have arrested 30 Arab suspects since Thursday on suspicion of arson, or inciting arson, for their alleged roles in starting at least 17 of the 110 fires, which spread rapidly from the strong winds and arid conditions.Since the fires broke out, the Israel Air Force used several unmanned aerial vehicles, including the Shoval and Eitan drones, to conduct reconnaissance flights.According to Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman, “There have been 334 hours of reconnaissance work by drones, gliders and the like.”Speaking in the settlement of Halamish, northwest of Ramallah, on Sunday, Liberman said 3,500 soldiers (eight battalions in the West Bank) – including 750 reservists, 500 firefighters from the Home Front Command, and another 23 firefighters in the air – took part in battling the fires. According to the IDF, while the majority of the fires have died down, reservists have still not been released from duty.Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said Monday that several detonated petrol bombs have been taken as evidence, as hundreds of officers continue to work with the Shin Bet on investigations that are ongoing.“Out of those arrested, 16 are Arab-Israeli and 14 are Palestinians, or illegal workers from the West Bank,” said Rosenfeld, adding that six of the suspects have been released without charges. “Police units and security personnel continue to carry out investigations and make arrests as they search for suspects responsible for the fires, using concrete evidence that we gathered from each of the different fires, which have been examined by forensics teams.”Still, Rosenfeld noted that weather conditions also played a major role in starting and spreading many of the blazes.“All of the fires were not arson,” he said.“Although, many of the suspects may have taken advantage of the weather conditions, which were perfect in order to carry out attacks.”While all the major blazes have been put out, Rosenfeld cautioned that high winds and dry weather remain problematic, allowing smaller fires to start and spread.Rosenfeld said the international aid received from multiple countries – including planes from the US, Russia, Greece, Croatia, and Turkey – was critical in helping thinly spread Israeli firefighters contain the blazes.The US Supertanker, which arrived on Friday and is the largest aerial firefighting aircraft in the world capable of carrying up to 19,600 gallons of flame retardant and water – generated criticism by some government officials who deemed it too costly and superfluous.However, during a Monday morning interview with Reshet Bet, Eyal Gabay, former director-general of the Prime Minister’s Office, defended the government’s use of the Supertanker, which critics argued came too late, and was little more than a PR stunt.Citing the importance of “risk management” amid the volatile conditions, Gabay emphasized that the government must continue to exercise extreme caution.“We know that there is a reasonable chance some of the fires are not accidental, so naturally, you want to have surplus power,” he said. “In the face of cost, let us remember what the extent of the damage is here with what the cost was to bring the Supertanker.”Moreover, Gabay cited 2010’s deadly Mount Carmel forest fire, which killed 44 people, as an important precedent and reminder of the need to ensure maximum resources are readily available when such conflagrations endanger communities.“We learned the hard way after the Carmel fire disaster,” he said, noting the tragedy as an example for the need to not allow financial concerns to hinder life-saving.

    "text": "Who's winning, who's losing, and why. Nov. 29 2016 6:35 PM We Can’t Afford to Ignore Donald Trump’s Tweets His 140-character spasms might be a distraction. But they are also too dangerous to dismiss. Donald Trump pauses during a campaign event on Sept. 6 in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Alex Wong/Getty Images \nOne important, if meta, story that has arisen since the election of Donald J. Trump is this one: How should the media cover the soon-to-be president in an era when neither truth nor shame hold any sway? A few indispensable pieces by James Fallows (“The news media are not built for someone like this“) and Jack Shafer (“Think three steps ahead of Trump! Improvise! We need to play our best game, not his”) show that, unless we figure this mess out swiftly, journalists—and more importantly, the American people—will continue to be played by Trump. Dahlia Lithwick \nDahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate , and hosts the podcast Amicus . \nThere is one strain of thinking that suggests, not at all unreasonably, that as journalists we must not take our eyes off the “real stories ” (conflicts of interest, violations of the Emoluments Clause, dangerous Cabinet appointments) to cover the craziness of Trump’s itchy Twitter finger. Jonathan Chait, for instance , warned us Tuesday morning not to pay too much attention to Trump’s latest threats to jail and strip citizenship from flag-burners, because it’s a deliberate distraction from the corruption and conflicts he doesn’t want probed. “Trump does not want coverage of his plans to enrich himself and his family or to strip the safety net,” Chait writes. “A fight over patriotism and citizenship frames the president-elect as the champion of American nationalism — giving a kind of legitimacy that overcomes his defeat in the national vote.” And Paul Waldman similarly cautions in the Washington Post that calling out every last awful and demonstrably false Trump tweet only serves to further reinforce his followers’ views about a biased press and will only spread his lies more widely. Advertisement \nChait, Waldman, and their brethren are probably right about why Trump tweets and the dangers of covering his 140-character spasms. They think we must try as journalists and readers to erect a kind of wall of sanity between Trump’s demented and perhaps deliberately distracting tweets and his actions—that we must try to draw a line between what is real enough to cover and what is noise. More and more I suspect we should ignore their advice. \nMan is it tempting to believe that we can create a rule that tells us when to write about a 3 a.m. Trump tweet. How sane and logical it could be if we could simply cordon off Trump’s real thoughts and deeds from his Dada rantings. Then maybe we in the press could still do at least some creditable work in covering that which we know to be real—secretary of transportation appointments and the dismemberment of Obamacare and Medicare. But the truth for journalists is that we cannot pick and choose which of Trump’s words matter, and the larger truth is that we shouldn’t try. All of his words matter, and none of us have any notion at this stage which threats are predictors of doom and which are mere burps and farts. Get Slate in your inbox. \nAs demoralizing and painful as it is to have to report and interpret the crazy Trump statements as seriously as we do the “legitimate” ones, that is necessarily going to be the work of the coming years. We don’t get to impose a hierarchy of our own chosen logic or meaning on a presidency constructed of lies and deflections. We must treat even the most deranged speech acts as dangerous, without giving Trump credit for only meaning some of the threats and floating the others simply to confuse us. Just because Trump’s ethical violations and Cabinet appointments appear to be more immediate and troubling than his inchoate assault on speech and protest, rest assured that he is capable of doing it all. We need to take the actual deeds and vague language as equally frightening. Processing only what appears rational or immediately threatening means not doing our job. All of Trump’s words matter, and none of us have any notion which threats are predictors of doom and which are mere burps and farts. \nWill this lead journalists to sometimes “take the bait” and let Trump dictate the terms of our coverage via what he decides to tweet about in the middle of the night, as some have suggested? I don’t think that’s the right question to ask. After all, agreeing to not cover his tweets also allows him to dictate the terms of discourse. Ignoring his more outlandish tweets during the campaign didn’t make them less real than his policy papers. Advertisement \nAs for his motivations: It’s irrelevant whether these tweets are the work of a cunning chess master or a damp TV-watching toddler who can’t control himself when his aides leave his side. Whether his rants are intentional or accidental distractions is between Trump and his own lizard brain. The fact that these tweets are destabilizing to the rule of law is all that matters. \nOne of the most compelling arguments for treating Trump’s madcap tweets as deathly serious comes from Masha Gessen’s long meditation on surviving an autocracy in the New York Review of Books , in which she puts forth, as her rule No. 1, “Believe the autocrat.” Gessen, who has the experience to know, writes that, despite the fact that the autocrat seems completely crazy or distracting, “he means what he says. Whenever you find yourself thinking, or hear others claiming, that he is exaggerating, that is our innate tendency to reach for a rationalization.” \nThe other truly necessary caution against sorting Trump’s statements into those that are terrifying but real and those that are terrifying but crazy comes from Ned Resnikoff , writing this week on ThinkProgress about Trump’s lies. His point is that even Trump’s biggest whoppers—like his recent statements about voter fraud—have a purpose: to create an alternate reality and to cause us to doubt our own reality. This goes beyond lying for manipulation. It is, as Resnikoff contends, a way to create a need for a strong-man presidency: “By attacking the very notion of shared reality, the president-elect is making normal democratic politics impossible. When the truth is little more than an arbitrary personal decision, there is no common ground to be reached and no incentive to look for it.” \nTempting though it may be to cherry-pick which portions of Trump’s sprawling alternate reality are real-real and which are distractions from what we think are real is its own form of insanity: It assumes that there is some underlying political truth that we as journalists can ferret out by consensus, but there is not. \nWhen Trump tells us in the English language that he intends to strip American protesters of their citizenship and overrule the Supreme Court’s holdings on protected speech, we in the press should not spend a lot of time agonizing over what he really means or what he’s trying to say. He just told us. Now let’s cover it, and cover it like he means it. I suspect he does. Load Comments",

    "text": "\nAn inviting looking geyser in Yellowstone National Park. Brocken Inaglory / Wikimedia Commons \nLast week, a young pair of tourists' holiday took a turn for the horrific when one of them fell into a boiling, acidic pool in Yellowstone National Park and \"dissolved.\" \nColin and Sable Scott, a brother and sister from Oregon, left the authorized area and walked around the Norris Geyser Basin in Wyoming to find a thermal pool to take a dip in. While Colin was leaning down to check the temperature in one hole, he slipped and fell into it. \n\"In a very short order, there was a significant amount of dissolving,\" Lorant Veress, a Yellowstone deputy chief ranger, told NBC affiliate KULR 8 last week. \nSince 1870, at least 22 people have died from injuries related to thermal pools and geysers in the park. It's alarming that a person can tumble into a pool of water and there to be nothing left but a flip-flop, but there are a few reasons why this can happen. The pools are really, really hot. \nFirstly, Yellowstone park sits on top of a geologically active supervolcano. With magma bubbling so close to the surface, geysers and hot springs can reach burning temperatures. \nThe Scotts happened to choose the hottest thermal region in the park, where temperatures can reach 237 degrees Celsius (roughly 456 degrees Fahrenheit). That's hotter than the temperature you cook most food at in an oven. They're also acidic — and unsafe. \nMost of the water in the park is alkaline, but the water in the Norris Geyser Basin is highly acidic. This is because of hydro-thermal vents under the surface emitting chemicals. Microorganisms also break off pieces of surrounding rocks, which adds sulfuric acid to the pools. This highly acidic water bubbles to the surface where it can burn anyone that is exposed to it. \nIn 2012, a study published in the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems examined water that came from the Heart Lake Geyser Basin. They found that safe and unsafe water originates from the same underground spot, but they separate as they reach the surface. Some microorganisms can live there, but humans melt. \nCertain microorganisms called extremophiles have evolved to live in extreme conditions such as very high temperatures and acidity. These are what make the water look milky in color. \nHowever, the conditions are deadly for humans, and the water can cause fatal burns and break down human flesh and bone. \n\"It is wild and it hasn't been overly altered by people to make things a whole lot safer, it's got dangers,\" Veress said. \"And a place like Yellowstone which is set aside because of the incredible geothermal resources that are here, all the more so.\" \nIn other words, stick to the trail.

    "text": "Soldier to sue Government and former Defence legal chief for 'malicious prosecution' Exclusive by Helen Grasswill and Sharon Davis Updated November 25, 2016 07:11:53 \nA former commando at the centre of one of Australia's most controversial and secret military cases has begun legal proceedings against the Australian Government and the former director of military prosecutions, Brigadier Lynette McDade, for malicious prosecution. Key points: David Millar had manslaughter charges — that were later dismissed — brought against him by director of military prosecutions (DMP) over deadly Afghanistan raid He claims allegations surrounding that case are demonstrably false but remain publicly available Legal proceedings by Mr Millar against the Australian Government and DMP believed to be the first in Australian military history \nThe former reservist, David Millar, filed a statement of claim in the New South Wales Supreme Court last month. \nIt is believed to be the first claim of its kind in Australian military history. \nThe claim alleges that the former director of military prosecutions (DMP) brought manslaughter charges against Mr Millar \"maliciously, and without reasonable and probable cause\". \nMr Millar, a lance corporal at the time, was the lead scout in a horrific commando raid on a family compound in Uruzgan province, Afghanistan, in which five children and a man were killed in 2009. \nBoth he and another commando, Sergeant J, were subsequently charged with manslaughter with criminal negligence by Brigadier McDade. \nAccording to the soldiers, when they entered the compound in the early hours of the morning of February 12, 2009, the Afghan man began continuously firing at them from a room and, due to the layout of the enclosure, they had no means of escape. \nOn orders from Sergeant J — the sergeant in command — Lance Corporal Millar threw two grenades into the room. \nMr Millar told Australian Story in May that it was only on entering the room after the dust had settled that they realised women and children were also inside . Video: David Millar tells Australian Story of his experience in Afghanistan (ABC News) \nThe manslaughter charges sent shockwaves through the military and were the subject of a sustained public outcry, with accusations of \"armchair\" ignorance of combat conditions. \nIn May 2011, the military's Chief Judge Advocate, Brigadier Ian Westwood, dismissed the case against the two men at a pre-trial hearing and a court martial did not eventuate. \nAccording to the statement of claim, there was insufficient evidence to warrant the laying of charges and Mr Millar's actions \"were in accordance with his Rules of Engagement and the orders given by Sergeant J\". \nIt is claimed that the DMP \"was aware or should have been aware\" that for a charge of manslaughter with criminal negligence to succeed, it was necessary to establish that Mr Millar had a duty of care to the civilian victims, however, forces of the Crown have no such duty of care in armed conflict for an offence of this type. \nThe statement asserts that the DMP \"knew or ought to have known\" that there was no reasonable prospect of a court martial being satisfied that Mr Millar knew there were non-combatants in the room into which he threw the grenades. \nIt is also claimed that the DMP \"knew or ought to have known\" that Mr Millar had no avenue of retreat without placing himself and other soldiers in the field of machine-gun fire coming from the building. \nIn the pre-trial hearing before Brigadier Westwood, no alternative course of action was put forward by the prosecution. Claim says allegations are 'demonstrably false' but remain public \nThe statement of claim also cites a ministerial submission that surfaced in May after a Freedom of Information request from Australian Story. \nThis document, a memorandum dated September 23, 2011, was sent by Brigadier McDade to then-defence minister Stephen Smith after he had requested a full account of the failure of the charges against the soldiers. \nBrigadier McDade stated that she charged the two commandos because they threw grenades into a room \"when they ought to have known\" that women and children were present and before posting the second grenade \"knew for certain that there were women and children in the room\" and that they both supplied statements to this effect, which the soldiers strongly denied. \nAccording to the claim, these allegations are demonstrably false but remain publicly available, including on a Defence website, which has caused Mr Millar \"additional anguish, distress and mental harm\". \nThe claim also states that the submission from the DMP was \"high-handed, malicious and oppressive and aggravated the injury to the plaintiff\". \nMr Millar is claiming general damages for harm to his reputation and professional standing, for mental distress and for significant dislocation to his life caused by the DMP's actions. \nThe document also outlines claims for aggravated and exemplary damages, and for past and future economic loss. \nNo claim figure has been raised. Lance Corporal Millar has DMP's 'greatest sympathy' \nMr Millar and other members of his regiment told Australian Story earlier this year that they were still angry that the Australian Defence Force had not formally exonerated them . A request for redress of this situation is expected to be renewed. \nThe ABC understands that the statement of claim has not yet been served on the defendants, but lawyers for Mr Millar have notified Veterans Affairs Minister Dan Tehan, in the hope that he can assist an early settlement with the relevant government agencies including the Directorate of Military Prosecutions and the Defence department, to avoid a full hearing and the associated trauma that this would involve for Mr Millar and other parties. \nIn a brief statement to Australian Story, when asked for a response to the claim, Brigadier McDade said: \n\"He has my greatest sympathy. However this litigation, if he has commenced it, will not assuage his guilty conscience. I wish him well in what must be a difficult time for him.\" \nWatch David Millar's story in Into the Fog of War Part One and Part Two on Australian Story.

(AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, November 21, 2016, 7:40 PM \nThe St. Louis man who shot an officer in the face was a teenage possible murder suspect afraid of being recognized, according to police. \nPolice say that George P. Bush III shot a sergeant twice Sunday evening before being found and killed hours later in a shootout with other officers. \nThe unidentified 46-year-old wounded officer was treated and released from the hospital Monday morning. \nSt. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said that 19-year-old Bush was wanted in connection to robberies, a carjacking and possibly a killing. \n“We believe he knew he was good for those crimes and that we were looking for him,” Dotson, who called the attack an \"ambush,\" said. \n“That’s why he aggressively attacked a police officer.” \nThe teen was also facing a resisting arrest charge from last year, when he allegedly fled during a traffic stop.

In the current currency chaos, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has discovered that babus and staff at the State Excise department and Regional Transport Office (RTOs) are surreptitiously trying to exchange their old, ill-gotten currency with new notes at their offices while conducting their daily business in order to avoid facing uncomfortable questions at banks.\nThe State Excise department and RTO are among those government departments that have daily monetary dealings with citizens. The excise department collects money for new permits, renewals, penalties and fines, while the RTO collects it for issuing licences, renewals, transfers, permits and other works. The daily collection at RTOs is around Rs. 5 crore.\nSources in the anti-graft agency said they have received information that the officers and staff at these two departments were using in-house funds to convert their illegitimate earnings. \n\nAll government offices that have daily monetary transactions have been instructed to accept old currency. Now, with flow of new currency being normalised, government offices have started getting new notes. Grabbing the opportunity, personnel at these two departments have started exchanging their old currency with the new ones and in smaller denominations of Rs. 100, Rs. 50 and Rs. 10. \n\nThe ACB suspects that the money is unaccounted for and generated through illegitimate means. \"Though the amount of funds involved is not very large, but because it has been occurring every day, it's a cause for concern,\" said a senior official. It has been observed that other government departm ents that have daily cash transactions are also indulging in such malpractice. Bank staff, loan sharks and money lenders have used this opportunity and influence with bank managers to convert their black money, officials said.\nOld notes? You bet! \nACB sources said many bookies at Mahalaxmi Racecourse are accepting old notes for betting. \"These are bookies who run 'dabba' betting schemes, a term coined for those who run unauthorised betting schemes at the racecourse. Weekends are big days for betting. Acting on the information that a large amount of black money for betting transactions had been brought to the racecourse, the ACB carried out searches at the place on Saturday, but the bookies managed to flee with the money,\" a senior ACB officer said",

But he said the dance was not an homage to the retired defensive back. \nRather, it was tribute to Mac Dre, a Bay Area rapper who was shot and killed in 2004. \n“It was for Mac Dre,” Edelman told reporters after the game, as aired on WBZ-TV’s “Patriots 5th Quarter.”“He’s no longer with us. It was something if you played football in the Bay Area, you know about it. If you don’t, that’s your fault.” ",

You look at what happened on election night. Our economic message clearly isn’t penetrating. I think we need to be focused on these folks who live in areas like mine where the median household income is $57,000 a year, which means a husband and wife are working and each making under 30 grand.\nThey don’t see the Democratic Party as a home for them, and they left us in droves on Tuesday night. And now we’re left to clean up the mess, and I think the issue really is, how do you connect to those voters?\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you saying the Democrats’ message has been the wrong one, or they just had the wrong messengers in Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi, among others?\nREP. TIM RYAN: Well, our party has become a coastal party, and that was revealed again on Tuesday, where the middle of the country is red and we have blue on the coasts.\nAnd that is no way to sustain a national party. And so I think it has been the messengers, it has been the message. The people in Middle America think that the Democrats are too close to the donor class, and that they care more about the donor class than they do about the working class.\nSo, we have to change that, or we’re never going to get back into the majority, Judy.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: We know that experts who look at the loss of blue-collar manufacturing jobs in this country over the past decade or more say that, yes, some of these jobs can come back, but many of them will not come back because of automation, because of robotics, because of globalization.\nIs there a danger in misleading voters about that?\nREP. TIM RYAN: I don’t think it’s misleading them at all. I think it’s being there with them, understanding their issues.\nYes, the low-end manufacturing, it is not coming back. And I think we’re lying to the American people if we say they are coming back. But there is a huge opportunity in advanced manufacturing with regard to aerospace or wind turbines, where the average wind turbine has about 8,000 component parts, gear shifts, hydraulics, bolts, aluminum.\nThose are things that we can make in communities like mine and other communities in the Great Lake states. So, a focus on renewable energy really is about a resuscitation of our manufacturing base, all the while trying to create those new high-tech jobs in the maker movement, in additive manufacturing, which is projected to grow at 25 percent a year for the next 10 years, but getting our work force in front of these areas of the economy that are going to grow, but, at the same time, recognizing, Judy, that there’s a lot of people in communities that don’t want to get retrained to run a computer.\nThey want to run a backhoe and they want to sling cement blocks. And so by rebuilding the country through a strong infrastructure program, we could put those people back to work, too.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned — you talked about the Democrats becoming a party of the coasts, that the rest of the country has been overlooked.\nIt’s also been said by Democrats themselves the party has been too much into what they call identity politics, paying attention to particular groups, African-Americans, Hispanics, the LGBT community, certain groups of women, and so on. Do you think that’s a problem for the Democratic Party? And if you do, what do you do about it?\nREP. TIM RYAN: I don’t think they’re mutually exclusive.\nI think we have a role and responsibility, especially after the kind of campaign we just came through, to make sure that we are going to vigorously fight for equality for all Americans. And those issues are very, very important to us.\nBut the heart of our party has to be a message that unites the entire party and unites independents and Republicans maybe to come our way. And that message is a strong, robust economic message. I mean, you look at Trump and why he won, he had all these issues that a lot of people maybe didn’t want to talk about or maybe didn’t agree with him on, but his economic message was so robust that it won the day, and it won the day big time.\nAnd so we better get back to a robust economic message about the future, what’s the future look like, what’s the future of work, where do we have to make investments, where are the public-private partnerships, where are the business incubators, where’s the research. Those are Democratic issues. We know how to do this much better than the Republicans.\nBut we have got to focus on it and let everyone know, whether you’re a millennial or a middle-class person in places like Youngstown, Ohio, that you’re going to have an opportunity in a Democratic economy.\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman Tim Ryan, running for minority leader in the House of Representatives, we thank you.\n  Democratic Party House minority leader nancy pelosi ohio Tim Ryan  ",

    "text": "Pinterest \nPC gaming: two beautiful words that represent freedom in framerates and quality. Unfortunately, as time passes by, more and more gamers are stereotyping PCs as a waste of money as it requires a relatively high cost of entry and look to more affordable options in the form of consoles instead. While this may be true initially PC gaming is actually cheaper than consoles in the long run…but that’s an argument for another day. \nBut how exactly can you begin your accession to the glorious world of PC gaming – without making their wallets and bank accounts cry collectively? After some discussions with the team, we found that while the word “budget gaming PC” is very subjective in terms of what value denotes “budget”, we agreed to work on a decent budget of around RM3,500 for the core hardware to get you going. \nWhen we searched for the components for this PC build, we had two main factors in mind: initial cost and upgradeability. So, here are the PC components that we recommend for our readers who are looking into building their first gaming PC or are simply looking for hardware recommendations to upgrade their existing ones: Processor / CPU (Central Processing Unit):Intel Core i5-6500 Image: Gecid.com \nChoosing a processor that is capable of annexing those used in ‘current-gen’ consoles wasn’t that hard actually. Come to think of it, the choices are almost endless. Of course, we had to settle for one processor which we thought would not only be significantly more powerful than console CPUs, but also affordable at the same time. \nBehold, the Intel Core i5-6500 quad-core CPU, which comes with a base frequency of 3.2GHz and a ‘Turbo’ frequency speed of 3.6GHz. In contrast, the recently released PlayStation 4 Pro uses an AMD Jaguar-based CPU that clocks in at 2.1GHz. Don’t even get us started on that 1.7GHz CPU on the Xbox One S. \nMore importantly, it balances price and performance really well, making it a fantastic choice for those looking for more than decent everyday performance when not gaming. Motherboard: ASRock B150M-HDV \nThe motherboard of choice for this build would be the ASRock B150M-HDV. Now, some might wonder, why have we suggested a B150 motherboard instead of a H170 or Z170? Again, our two core factors come into play: B150-class motherboards are not only very affordable, they are also more than capable of housing more-than-decent PC components. \nThere are, however, downsides to B150 motherboards. These include no overclocking, RAID, and PCIe storage support (fear not, as SSDs are supported). But if you’re not planning use any of those, then the ASRock B150M-HDV would be more than enough. That said, if you do plan to, say, one day upgrade to a PCIe-based storage device (M.2, U.2), then it’s best to consider getting a H170 motherboard instead. \nFor the purposes of our build (it being a budget proposition, after all), this is a great option. RAM (Random Access Memory): HyperX Fury 8GB DDR4 2133MHz \nKingston’s HyperX Fury lineup of RAMs may be popular with folks who have high-end X99-based systems, but they’re also suitable for B150 motherboards as well; just make sure you have a CPU that supports them. For this PC build, we went with the Kingston HyperX Fury 8GB DDR4 RAM, which has a frequency speed of 2,400MHz. That said, one can also opt for other brands as well, because most RAMs nowadays have very little to separate them from one another. \nSide note: we strongly recommend readers to purchase RAMs last, because unlike other components listed in this build, RAM prices tend to fluctuate a lot. In addition, it would be best for one to check the compatibility of their motherboard of choice before purchasing RAMs as well (some may support 2,133MHz only instead of 2,400MHz). Graphics Card: Gigabyte RX 480 G1 Gaming 8GB \nMost (especially my colleagues) would probably wonder I went for an AMD graphics card instead of an Nvidia graphics card. Personal preferences aside, it all comes down to the benefits that the RX 480 has to offer over the GTX 1060, which can be seen as a like-for-like competitor to the Radeon card. \nPerformance-wise, the Nvidia GTX 1060 may be a few percent faster when it comes to playing older DirectX 11 games, but most games that run on DirectX 12 and Vulkan play better on the Radeon RX 480. Obviously, DirectX 12 and Vulkan will be the go-to API in the near future, so the Radeon card has the advantage of being more future-proof. Moreover, the GTX 1060 only comes with a maximum VRAM capacity of 6GB, while the RX 480 has 8GB. Though it may not seem important now, PC games will soon be utilising more and more GPU memory, so it’ll be wise to pick the card with higher VRAM. \nSo, if you’re keen on getting a Radeon RX 480, I’d recommend the Gigabyte RX 480 G1 Gaming 8GB graphics card. It comes with a core clock speed of 1,290MHz and a memory clock speed of 8,000MHz. In addition, the graphics card is also rather small in size (40mm x 232mm x 116mm), which means that it can easily be placed in either an ATX or ITX case. PC Case: Bitfenix Prodigy Mini-ITX Image: Tested \nA neat-looking PC is one that is compact and easy to carry around – like a console, if you will. We think that the perfect PC case that fits all two aforementioned requirements would be the Bitfenix Prodigy Mini-ITX PC case. It comes with an internal dimension of 250mm x 310mm x 340mm, which, of course, is sufficient to fit all components listed in this article. \nNot only is the Bitfenix Prodigy Mini-ITX pretty to look at, it can also be easily carried around thanks to four ‘FyberFlex Composite’ handles found on the top and bottom of the PC case. This PC case also comes in six colour options, but we recommend you to get the ‘Fire Red’ colour scheme because Lowyat.NET = red. PSU (Power Supply Unit):Aerocool KCAS 500W \nThe most underrated and important piece of PC hardware that one must have is the PSU (power supply unit). The choice of a good PSU will ensure that your marathon gaming sessions has a low chance of low efficiency and overheating that may result in catastrophic consequences for your previous machine . To avoid this, our advice for you is to get a PSU with at least an “80 Plus Bronze” certification – just to be safe. \nFor this build, we have chosen the Aerocool KCAS 500W power supply which, thankfully, comes with an 80 Plus Bronze rating. It’s fitted with two 6+2-pin power connectors along with support for up to seven SATA connectors (for multiple HDDs). Best of all, the PSU also has a rather affordable price tag. There are cheaper PSUs out there, of course, but we strongly believe that PSUs are worth investing a little more on. Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Western Digital 1TB Caviar Blue Image: BlueRockYT (Youtube) \nThe final piece of for this PC build would be the hard drive, and we’ve decided to opt for the reliable Western Digital 1TB Caviar Blue HDD. Tthis HDD is equipped with a physical disc that spins at a standard 7,200rpm (5,400rpm is so 2010, am I right?). In addition, the Western Digital 1TB Caviar Blue HDD is also capable of a modest sequential read and write speeds of about 159MBps and 155MBps respectively. \nGaming performance shouldn’t be affected too much regardless of the speed (7,200rpm is the current standard after all) and capacity of a HDD. The only probable issue that one may face when using a standard 3.5-inch 7200rpm hard disk is slightly longer loading times in games that require a PC to read tons of data in a short amount of time. \nOn a separate note, you can always drop a few hundred Ringgit for an additional SSD to install Windows and your games on, while using the WD hard drive for storage. It instantaneously improves load times, so for those who are “allergic” to long load times, by all means, get an SSD with the HDD. Total Cost Photo for illustration purposes only. \nNow that we’ve wrapped up everything one needs to build a decent low-cost budget PC that is flexible enough for future upgrades, let’s take a look at one last important detail: cost. Below is the list of PC components used in this build along with their “best” prices (as of November 2016): \n– Intel Core i5-6500 = RM850 @ Ideal Tech– ASRock B150M-HDV = RM283 @ E Tech PC– HyperX Fury 8GB DDR4 2133MHz = RM256 @ E Tech PC– Aerocool KCAS 500W 80+ Bronze = RM186 @ Castle IT– Bitfenix Prodigy Mini-ITX = RM299 @ Tech View IT– Gigabyte RX 480 G1 Gaming 8GB = RM1,239 @ Kool PC– Western Digital 1TB Caviar Blue = RM196 @ ITCOM \nTotal cost = RM3,309 (excluding shipping charges and other miscellaneous fees) \nAs you can see, we’ve left out the other external hardware in this build and focused only on the core hardware. The monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers are a lot more subjective which makes it harder to recommend “the best” option – so we’ll leave that to you to decide when you build your PC. Final Words \nIt is important to note that this is a PC build recommendation , and we know it’ll likely stir some debate on our choice of “Hardware A” versus “Hardware B”. But the way we see it, that’s the beauty of PC building. There are just so many possible combinations, alterations and upgrades that can be done to a particular build, making it almost impossible to pinpoint a perfect one. \nAlso, you may have noticed that we did not actually build this PC. We actually had built one recently, but we needed one that’s more capable for photo and video editing (alongside some decent gaming). Our allocated budget was therefore a little higher, which we’ll also attempt to include the accessories we got with them. We’ll be publishing our final build in the coming weeks, so keep a look out! \nWe only have but one thing left to say in this build recommendation: may your framerates be high, and your temperatures low! 0",

Photo: Supplied ╳ exit \nDeputy Premier and NSW Nationals leader John Barilaro and his wife Deanna have been hiring out a palatial $2 million holiday house via Airbnb and other accommodation websites for thousands of dollars a night. \nWhile Mr Barilaro has declared ownership of the home to the Parliament for two years, he only declared the business use on Wednesday, via an amendment to his register of interests, after it was raised by Fairfax Media. \nQuestions are now being asked about whether Mr Barilaro had a conflict of interest when he became minister for regional tourism four months after the property was purchased and when cabinet discussed the regulation of the collaborative economy in NSW for businesses like Uber, Airbnb and Stayz. \nRecords show the Barilaros purchased the 94 hectare property, \"Dungowan Estate\", at Oallen near Braidwood, for $2.015 million on June 13, 2014. \nIn October that year Mr Barilaro became minister for regional tourism, a position he held until April 2015. He remains Minister for Small Business, Skills and Regional Development. \nFeaturing a lake, tennis court, boatshed, swimming pool and \"a fully equipped butler's pantry\" the six-bedroom, five-bathroom Dungowan Estate is described on its website as \"the ultimate vacation home\". \nA listing on Airbnb offers the property for $1750 a night, while the Stayz website gives the option of $10,500 for a week. The property has been listed on Airbnb since April this year and on Stayz since at least November 2014, according to user reviews. \nA listing description by Ray White real estate agents at Braidwood from 2014 states: \"Currently partially leased for executive holiday stays, the property generates an income of over $160,000 pa.\" \nIn January this year Better Regulation Minister Victor Dominello released a government position paper on the collaborative economy. It stated the government \"welcomes the positive impact of the collaborative economy for consumer choice, employment and productivity\". \nA government inquiry last month published a report into the regulation of short-term holiday letting in NSW, which examined businesses like Airbnb and Stayz. \nThe inquiry recommended the government amend state planning polices \"to allow short-term rental accommodation\". \nDeputy Opposition Leader Michael Daley said: \"Right now, the government is looking into regulations around Airbnb and Stayz. \n\"Did Mr Barilaro disclose to the Premier, to the cabinet or to the Parliament this potential conflict of interest?\" he asked. \"If not, why not?\" \nMr Barilaro's spokesman said the Deputy Premier \"has not been involved in the inquiry and if a government response is considered by cabinet he would, of course, raise any likely conflict of interest.\" \nAsked if Mr Barilaro declared a conflict of interest upon becoming regional tourism minister, the spokesman said: \"As per the declaration requirements the property in question was disclosed on the minister's parliamentary disclosures – any cabinet discussions remain in cabinet and, of course, are not made public.\" \nThe parliamentary rules require MPs to disclose any additional income, including from a partnership or trust. \nRecords show Mr and Mrs Barilaro established a family partnership with an Australian Business Number on June 20, 2014, which registered the Dungowan Estate website. \nMr Barilaro's spokesman said: \"The partnership owning 'Dungowan' made a loss during the return periods and so it has been interpreted as not requiring declaration.\" \n\"However, the Deputy Premier has now lodged a discretionary return with the clerk in the interests of full disclosure,\" he said.

    "text": "What to Expect from VICELAND's New Show 'Payday' By VICE Staff \nNovember 25, 2016  Share  Tweet  WhatsApp \nOver the years, Rollie Pemberton has built a career both writing about music for outlets like Pitchfork and making music under his rapper alias, Cadence Weapon. He's also the host of VICELAND's new show Payday , which follows young people across North America as they attempt to make a living amidst our modern-day economic realities and anxieties. In advance of tonight's new episode, we talked to Pemberton about what viewers can expect from the show.\nVICE: Tell me about the message and mission behind Payday .\nRollie Pemberton: Payday isn't just about the different ways people make money—it's also about how people make money today. It's a very contemporary view on the different kind of jobs people can have today. Some of the people we feature have jobs that I'd never thought of them holding. There's one guy who's a funeral director in his twenties—you wouldn't necessarily think of that as a young person's job. It's a show about the economic realities for young people in America today.\nWhat stigmas is this show trying to break when it comes to young people and money today? \nIn Canada, the Finance Minister recently said young people should get used to having temporary jobs—that's going to be the future. the way the economy is going now. Our government is telling us that we should rely on inherently unreliable jobs that don't have benefits. So it's important that a show like this shows the lengths that people will go to make a living, and how dynamic and creative people can get when they don't have the option of having a typical salary-based job. Some of these people are working multiple jobs. In the Baltimore episode, we follow a tattoo artist who's also picking up scrap metal. People are doing whatever it takes to survive.\nThe baby boomer generation almost has an aversion to the level of freedom that our generation has—they're mad that we get to take chances and choose different things, because that wasn't an option to them. I don't think we're necessarily that different from the previous generation, I just think that we have the option to make these choices.\nIf you had to give a young person advice on how to financially survive in North America, what would you tell them? \nOne of the first things that I would tell them is to be knowledgeable, figure out something that you're passionate about, and become an expert on it. The younger generation feels like it's a startup generation—all of these people who've come up with their own ideas and created their own jobs that didn't exist before, in fields that didn't exist before. I went to journalism school, but I knew that I wanted to make rap music the whole time. Everyone around me was telling me, \"Don't do it—you have to stay in college, because this is the way people have always done things.\" Follow your own vision. We have access to so much that you can become extremely knowledgeable about something in a way that wasn't possible when we were young.\nWhat do you think is the greatest economic barrier that this generation of young people currently faces? \nDebt is one of the major issues for young people—specifically student debt, which is one of the biggest issues for people today. You have to go to college and get a job, and then you're getting a job to pay for college. You're fighting a mounting fear of monetary control, and I find that a lot of people on the show are dealing with debt in various ways.\nWhat's the worst job you've ever had? \nI worked in the garden center at Canadian Tire—it was one of the first jobs I'd ever had. I didn't know anything about plants, and there was another person working there who was an expert and was my age. People would get mad at me daily for not knowing what I was talking about because I had no training whatsoever. \nYou can catch Payday on VICELAND.

    "text": "Muslim Somali refugee student unleashes Ohio State attack with a vehicle and a knife... 9 hospitalized... campus was gun-free zone \n  Tags: Ohio State , knife attack , radical Muslim terrorist (NaturalNews) A Somali refugee university student named Abdul Artan unleashed a mass attack on fellow students today at Ohio State. The Muslim radical, who entered the United States under a student visa, pulled a fire alarm then \"mowed down evacuating students and staff with his car,\" reports the UK Daily Mail .The lying mainstream media originally misreported this story as a \"mass shooting,\" but it turns out the gunshots were law enforcement officers shooting Artan, halting his reign of violence as he stabbed students with a butcher knife . The name of the police officer who shot and killed Artan is Alan Horujko, who has been active with the force since January of 2015.UK Daily Mail describes the incident as a \"ISIS lone wolf-style attack\" carried out exactly as ISIS called for earlier this year . Ohio State is a \"gun free zone,\" meaning the school entices terrorists to target the campus for mass killings of students, knowing that students are not allowed to defend themselves with firearms. Notably, it was finally a gun carried by an OSU law enforcement officer who used lethal force against the assailant and ended his stabbing spree.As PJ Media reports: In the new PDF issue distributed widely via social media and Google Drive, an article on terror tactics assures would-be jihadists that \"one need not be a military expert or a martial arts master, or even own a gun or rifle in order to carry out a massacre or to kill and injure several disbelievers and terrorize an entire nation.\"\"Many people are often squeamish of the thought of plunging a sharp object into another persons flesh. It is a discomfort caused by the untamed, inherent dislike for pain and death, especially after 'modernization' distanced males from partaking in the slaughtering of livestock for food and the striking of the enemy in war,\" the unbylined article states. \"However, any such squirms and discomforts are never an excuse for abandoning jihad.\"ISIS suggested a \"campaign of knife attacks\" in which the attacker \"could dispose of his weapon after each use, finding no difficulty in acquiring another one.\" Obama has brought radical Islamic terrorist \"sleeper cells\" into the USA and strategically placed them across the country As you read all this, consider the evidence that Barack Obama, a Muslim hater of America, has spent much of his presidency deliberately placing Muslim refugees in cities and schools across America. The strategy is to distribute radical Muslims across the country, then wait for a few of them to unleash \"lone wolf\" attacks to cause maximum chaos and terror among the American populace.\"A U.S. official identified the suspect as a man of Somali descent,\" reports local CBS News . \"The official identified Abdul Razak Ali Artan as the now-deceased suspect. He was born in Somalia and living in the United States as a legal permanent resident.\"\"Artan fled Somalia with his family in 2007 before landing in Pakistan,\" reports Daily Caller . \"He moved to the United States in 2014, where he was granted legal, permanent status.\"From Daily Caller: The Lantern  OSUs campus newspaper  ran an interview with Artan just a few months ago, in which he criticized the school for not having Muslim prayer rooms on campus.I wanted to pray in the open, but I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media, he stated. Im a Muslim, its not what the media portrays me to be. Apparently, he is exactly what the media portrays radical Muslims to be! He's a terrorist who unleashed mass death upon American students. This attack underscores the importance of campus carry and extreme vetting of immigrants Once again, this attack demonstrates the absolute lunacy of \"gun free zones\" on college campuses. Had students been allowed to legally carry self-defense weapons, they could have very likely stopped this attacker before he stabbed so many people .This incident also reinforces the importance of so-called \"extreme vetting\" -- a Donald Trump strategy for making sure we don't allow radical Muslim terrorists to immigrate into the United States where they are later activated as lone wolf terrorists.More news on this issue is being published every few hours at NewsTarget.com .Listen to my full podcast covering this at Health Ranger Report or listen below: Non-GMO, Certified Organic Survival Food from the Health Ranger \nThe industry's only clean, lab tested and certified organic instant meals.",

How did West Coast do at the AFL draft? UP NEXT VIDEO How did West Coast do at the AFL draft? \nCameron was Sydney’s fourth pick and No.48 overall last night after a breakout season in which he played 19 league games for Claremont. \nThe 21-year-old ruck-forward was also a member of the WA side which crushed Tasmania by 134 points at Steel Blue Oval on June 11. \n“I can’t stop shaking,” he said. \n“I wouldn’t care whatever team it was. I am just so stoked to finally have it done. To hear your name called out is just an an unbelievable feeling. \n“It’s been my dream ever since I was a kid and every time I was rejected, it just pushed me to go harder and further, so I am happy to have it done.” \nA relieved Cameron said he started to think about missing out again before his name was called out. \n“I don’t think I’ve slept over the past two days,” he said. \n“Sitting there, waiting for my name, I didn’t think it was going to happen again. \n“To see it finally happen, I am still pinching myself.” \nCameron paid tribute to people who had helped him at Claremont and North Albany. \nAt 204cm and weighing 104kg, Cameron has bulked up considerably since starting with the Tigers colts in 2012. \n“I played all my junior footy with North Albany Kangas,” he said. \n“They are the red and whites too, so I think it’s a good match. \n“Football manager Darcy Coffey and all the people at Claremont, they have had a long four years with me. I have built a lot of close relationships. There will be a lot of people down there so happy for me.” \nCameron, who planned to celebrate with family and friends last night, but “take it easy”, believed he was ready to make an impact with Sydney in 2017. \nAnother Claremont product, forward Timm House, was Geelong’s fifth pick and No.68 overall. The 21-year-old, who played 27 colts and reserves games for the Tigers in 2013 and 2014, kicked five goals on debut for the Cats VFL side in June.

    "text": "KOTA KINABALU: Sabah is piecing together a conservation area that will eventually become a key biodiversity zone about four times the size of Penang island. \nState Forestry Department director Datuk Sam Mannan said the Kuamut Forest Reserve would be expanded by 14,000ha as part of efforts to realise this massive conservation area that was an important habitat for orang utan and other wildlife. \n“It is like piecing together the parts of a jigsaw puzzle. It will eventually be assembled,” he said yesterday.\nOn Thursday, the Sabah state assembly passed an amendment to the Forests (Constitution of Forest Reserves and Amendment) Enactment 1984.\nThe amendment, tabled by Assistant Minister in the Chief Minister’s Department Datuk Ellron Angin, will see Class 1 totally protected forest reserves being increased from 1.26 million hectares to 1.35 million hectares.\nThe area for Class VI virgin jungle reserves has also been increased from over 106,000ha to more than 107,000ha as well as wildlife forest reserves from nearly 138,000ha to over 139,000ha. \nHowever, the amendment will also provide for the removal of over 19,400ha of land from the existing forest reserves. \nThe department, said Mannan, was assembling a complex of protected areas comprising Kuamut, Ulu Segama, Dermakot and Segaliud Lokan forest reserves as well as the existing Maliau Basin and Danum Valley conservation zones.\nThe addition of areas, he said, was aimed at protecting water catchment areas in Sabah’s interior Keningau and Tambunan districts.\n“We did this at the request of the villagers who wanted to ensure water supply to areas was sustainable by protecting the forests around them,” he said. \nWhile some of the areas to be added had been logged about 20 to 30 years ago, these had since been regenerated, such as that in the northern Kota Belud district, said Mannan. \nThe removal of over 19,400ha, he said, was to correct some anomalies such as village land gazetted in the past as forest reserves. \n“Some of the affected land were also titled properties and we had to remove these from the forest reserves,” he added.",

The outbreak was detected at a farm in Biddinghuizen, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) west of Amsterdam, where about 180,000 ducks were put down together with another 10,000 within a one kilometre radius, the Dutch food and safety watchdog NVWA said.\n\"There are three other poultry farms within a three kilometre radius and they are being monitored,\" the NVWA added in a statement.\nAuthorities have also imposed a ban on poultry and poultry product transport within a 10 kilometre radius, the statement said.\nTests indicated that the birds were killed by an H5N8 variant of the disease \"which is highly infectuous\" for poultry -- killing about 30 percent of infected birds -- but not \"very dangerous to humans\", public newscaster NOS said.\nEarlier this month the Netherlands shuttered petting zoos and banned duck hunting as it stepped up measures to stem a bird flu outbreak blamed for killing scores of poultry and more than a thousand wild birds in the country.\nIn the western port of Rotterdam, a park closed its animal section after several aquatic birds were found to have died from the H5N8 virus. Others still not affected have been penned in.\nAnd on the banks of Lake Markermeer, close to Amsterdam, about 1,250 wild birds were found dead earlier this month, local news reports said.\nThe H5N1 strain of bird flu has killed more than 420 people, mainly in southeast Asia, since first appearing in 2003. Another strain of bird flu, H7N9, has claimed more than 200 lives since emerging in 2013, according to World Health Organisation figures.\nAvian flu severely hit the Netherlands in 2003 with health authorities destroying some 30 million birds in an effort to quash an outbreak.\nAround 106 million chickens are raised on Dutch poultry farms, according to the latest Dutch statistics.",

HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE   Hindustan Times via Getty Images NEW DELHI, INDIA - OCTOBER 7: People standing in queue during the launch of new iPhone 7 at world showroom DLF promenade ADVERTISEMENT \nAfter Prime Minister Narendra Modi's historic demonetisation announcement on 8 November, sales of many high-value goods shot up. One such item was Apple's iPhone. Many black money hoarders were converting their cash, buying these smartphones even at a premium price. \nAccording to a report in the Economic Times , almost 1 lakh Apple iPhones were sold just within three days of the announcement that ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 would no longer be legal tenders. Shopkeepers were selling the smartphones with backdated bills so that the sale money could be exchanged later or deposited legally in banks. \nThe iPhone is the most popular and easily available among high-value smartphones, available for sale for cash in stores or in the gray market. The recently released iPhone 7 is priced at ₹60,000 and up, with the high-end variant selling for up to ₹92,000. According to the ET report, iPhone sales were up by 20-30 percent this month as a direct consequence of demonetisation. \nIt is estimated that smartphones sales will shrink in the October-December quarter in India because of the cash crunch as many phone sales, both online or offline, were transacted in cash. Notably, 70 percent of the transactions on Indian e-commerce websites are made through cash. \n\"There is still a novelty factor for iPhones amongst Indian consumers since it is the costliest handset, and people were buying multiple units for themselves and to gift,\" Subhash Chandra, managing director of southern India's leading cellphone retailer Sangeetha Mobiles, told ET. \nIt was recently also reported that Google's Pixel phone is making its mark in the premium smartphone market with a 10 percent share in phone shipments in the month of October. Apple is still at the top with a whopping 62 percent market share, followed by Samsung.",

If using the red food coloring, add it now.Place the pork in a shallow 9 X 13-inch glass baking dish. Pour the marinade over. Marinate the pork in the refrigerator, covered, for 3 hours. Remove the pork from the dish. Reserve the marinade.Preheat the oven (425 degrees Fahrenheit for pork tenderloin, 350 degrees for shoulder or butt). Fill a shallow roasting pan with 1/2-inch of water and place in the bottom of the oven. Place the pork on a rack above the water. Roast until golden brown, brushing 2 or 3 times with the reserved marinade (about 30 minutes total roasting time for the tenderloin, 45 minutes total roasting time for the shoulder or butt). The internal temperature of the pork should be 160 degrees F. Remove and cool.When the pork is cool enough to handle, cut across the grain into pieces 1/4-inch thick.

    "text": "I Think I Had an Emotional Breakdown to DJ Khaled’s New Book, ‘The Keys’ By Joel Golby \nStaff Writer \nNovember 30,   DJ Khaled is a very pure man with a very pure heart who exudes positive energy like the sun. I am not. I am not like this. In many ways I am the anti-Khaled: ornery, negative, bleak. I revel in schadenfreude while Khaled celebrates the wins of his friends. Khaled is a pure laser beam of self-confidence stuffed into the body of a soft-faced teddybear; I am doughy and full of doubt. Khaled is open about his struggles with anxiety; I put my metaphorical head in the metaphorical sand and refuse to acknowledge mine. So you could say – and this is a bold statement, I know – you could say that I am not DJ Khaled. This is because I am not DJ Khaled. \nBut how could I – a man who is not DJ Khaled, remember – how could I become more like DJ Khaled? How? How, how, how? How? How, though? \n\nBelieve in this for it is real. We howled to the heavens and asked for guidance, and they delivered it to us. DJ Khaled has written a book. \nI have read this book. I did this in a single afternoon because I want to be a better man. I put DJ Khaled's advice in my head like water and let it trickle through me like a mountain. Walk with me now on the journey, through the journey of more success. \n\nThe first thing we have to talk about is the opening line of this book, because this is the best opening line of any book ever written. How many times have you sat down and tried to write a book? I'll be honest with you, I'll say it: three. I've tried three times. And every time I open a blank Word document and I go to write the first line and: \nYou know, there is a lot of pressure on a first line. This goes for articles, too. I spend entire mornings in the office on opening lines. Editors walk slowly behind my desk. \"Joel,\" they say. \"We're worried you don't ever do anything.\" Shh, I say. Hush. I click through Twitter a few more times. Tap out a first draft. No. Back again. Try over. And then DJ Khaled comes and fucking blows the world apart by opening his book with \"WALK WITH ME NOW ON THE PATHWAY TO MORE SUCCESS,\" the most perfect sentence ever written – opening or not – and now, truly, is there ever any point ever trying? Will I – a writer – ever write a better opening line than DJ Khaled – a DJ – just did? No I will not. So everything I write from now on will, necessarily, be trash. So the pressure is off. \nDon't you see? The most I can ever shoot for now is second best. \nDon't you see how DJ Khaled permeates everything, changes everything? Don't you see now that this man is a gift? \nWe are on page one and I can tell you it is going to get a hell of a lot more real from now on. \n\nThe Keys is, ostensibly, a self-help book, a life guide. Through it are woven elements of Khaled's biography, sure – little vignettes where \"having self belief\" is the moral of every story, times in Khaled's life when he has struggled then turned it around by really, really believing in himself, and also DJing – but it is primarily to help you, and me, and Young World (young people). DJ Khaled calls young people \"Young World\" because he is a visionary and the English language turns to putty in his hands, and also because he talks in a series of cod catchphrases, which, when stitched together in the latter stages of The Keys , is actually quite head spinning. \nI mean let's look at my notes, here: \nYoung world = young people\nSecure the bag = get money\nWire = still not 100 percent sure what the wire is but it is integral to bag security\nSnapchat = an opportunity\nHustle = work\nRick Ross = icon\nSpecial cloth = being a unique person\nBless up = both a salutation and an actual blessing to God\nOverstand = understand, but more\nFan Luv = positivity from his fans\nAngels = his flowers\nPlay yourself = the act of self-sabotage\nAnother one = another one Like: \n\nEarlier in the book, in an incredibly offhand way, he said he wants people to call him \"Billi\" now, because he is going to be a billionaire. I love him with my whole, whole heart. \nAnd then there is \"they\". Khaled talks about \"they\" a lot, although the concept of \"they\" is harder to define. Surface level, \"they\" is haters. But it's deeper than that: \"they\" might not even know they are \"they\". Friends could turn into \"they\" in front of your very eyes. \"They\", essentially, is a feeling of negativity that permeates from one person to another and clouds their success. If someone is stopping you from being successful, or hating you for your success, then they are \"they\". \nI honestly cannot explain why this image comes through as sideways. It is portrait on my computer. I can only assume this is a subversive plot by \"they\". \nI am closely analysing my life here. Who is the \"they\" in my life? Apart from the comments section on our Facebook posts? Truly, I don't have any \"they\". My close circle is strong and good. My girlfriend is great and very supportive. My family don't get in my way. Who hates me enough to want to see me fail? Who, truly, is holding me back from being a success? \nHold up: I am. \nI am my own \"they\". \nI played myself. \n\nYou go through waves, reading The Keys . As it starts you are like: heh. Oh, DJ Khaled. What are you like, with your funny little words and sayings! And then you move through, chapter after chapter of telling you to ignore haters and be good with finance, and you go: Hmm. I mean there is a lot of good advice here. Very basic, straightforward advice. But good advice. Around the page 150 mark you start to convince yourself that DJ Khaled is Jesus. And then, by the end, the fourth phase, you start to think that DJ Khaled's relentless positivity and self-belief is actually Quite a Lot to Deal With, and it all gets a bit much, and you have to stay 20 minutes after work just to stare at a wall for a second and regain equilibrium. \nI cannot quite decide if DJ Khaled is God or not, but I know he is important. \n\nThere are a lot of lessons in The Keys . Important ones, central to the Khaledian philosophy, the one that followers centuries from now will study and pore over (temples, banging out \"All I Do Is Win\" 20 hours a day, will welcome Khaled devotees, in shiny bomber jackets and with tite fades, where they will sit cross-legged in front of a placid garden of flowers and extend a single pinky finger to the sky, the finger clad always in jewels, the hand soft and manicured and the colour of tea, and they will whisper like an incantation, over and over again, until they find enlightenment there: another one. Another one, another one, another one ). \nThese lessons are: \"I REMEMBER\" (remember things); STAY AWAY FROM \"THEY\" (self explanatory); BE YOURSELF (s/e); DON'T EVER PLAY YOURSELF (don't mess up your own success with short term-ism, greed and foolishness [this chapter is tacked to a long story where DJ Khaled got a driving fine]); SECURE THE BAG (be wise with money, but also always be wanting money. Also: money isn't everything. It's a confusing chapter. Money is a real double-edger, here.); DON'T COMPLAIN (don't ever complain); RESPECT THE CODE; WEATHER THE STORM; STAY HUMBLE. \nBut then we start to run on the fumes of Khaled's lessons – the significance of his teachings weakens a little as the book wears on. We are told to KEEP TWO ROOMS COOKING AT THE SAME TIME (you think this means \"work on two things at once\", don't you? But it doesn't. It's something about... energy. I don't know. There's a story about him producing an album and he had people in two rooms. I didn't really get it.); TEMPTATION IS A TYPE OF \"THEY\" (the more Khaled raves about \"they\", the more \"that man who wears six coats and yells outside of Greggs\" he sounds); SNAPCHAT (Snapchat is a key); MAJOR KEY FOR REAL – DON'T DRIVE YOUR JETSKI IN THE DARK. There is a chapter about pillows and the importance of pillows. \n\nThere are sub-lessons scattered through like raisins in a cake, though: BE HUMBLE (but also be convinced that you are the best, and frequently say \"You Are The Best\" to will it into being true, Noel-Edmonds-and-the-universe style); GOOD ENERGY ATTRACTS GOOD ENERGY; KEEP YOUR FACE CLEAN (think this is partly literal – there is a lot about grooming in there, because we are talking about a man who gets two haircuts a week minimum – but also it's about staying sober, alert, clear-headed, pure hearted: keep your house in order, keep your face clean ); STAY PERSISTENT; LOVE and GOOD ENERGY are important pillars of the Khaled tent, a concept that can otherwise be described as VIBES; PATIENCE IS A TALENT; HAVE A LONG MEMORY. \nThey are good, clean lessons couched in the language of self-help, and, honestly, as a one-hit motivational punch, it's kind of brilliant. It's just 208 pages of DJ Khaled saying \"to be more successful, just be really, really DJ Khaled-y about it\". Like, there's a section where he says owning a house is great but mortgages are bad – which I think is him advocating the buying of Miami oceanside mansions in cash only, which is the most DJ Khaled thing ever – interwoven with stories about how he slept in his car when he was hustling his way up, because he had to. \n\nBy now I am fully converted to the church of Khaled. Powerful people hop on the mic to speak glowingly about him: Jay-Z, who Khaled reveres like a saint, gives a guest key (\"HONESTY\"); Fat Joe drops by to say how he knew the first day he met him that Khaled was special ( special cloth ). Rick Ross, who DJ Khaled sometimes jet-skis to the house of to have lunch with, and good god I would pay every penny I have to my name to attend such an event, gets in to say Khaled has been his knucklehead since the day. \nEverything I read about Khaled makes me like him more. I am convinced he is the best friend in the world. The Khaled we often see is a stitch-fit of memes, one gigantic blaring image of Khaled, Khaled in all white saying \"congratulations, you played yourself\" into a sneaker – but his positivity is more than a façade: it's a way of life that's got him here, that gets him collaborations, then leads to banger after banger. The major key that Khaled doesn't touch on is: goodness follows after goodness. Be good and good shit will come to you, bless up. \n\nThe 1980s were an insane time where it was impossible to make a bad song, and no more is that evident than in the 1984 Mr T bang-a-rang \"Treat Your Mother Right\". Here is the video: see T, stiff-legged and pulling a microphone from what I can only assume is his actual full ass, gruffly muttering: \"M is for the moan and the miserable groan from the pain that she felt when I was born\" over an absolutely ten-on-ten synth track. I mean, my dude: why in the fuck would you open a pro-Mother banger with a line about your mam tearing herself to shreds birthing you? \nBut we're getting off-topic. The point is, Mr. T – along with Hulk Hogan, who did an entire album about exercise – was part of a wave of weird 80s wholesomeness that I think we are circling back round to as the world gets meaner and meaner. Look at YouTube, where the young world's icons are curious, edgeless, nü- Blue Peter presenters, cheerful sexless creatures who document their every car journey and baking day. Look at Taylor Swift. Look at all the stats saying kids are drinking less and doing fewer drugs. The next generation coming up is shying away from this awful world by retreating into a sort of cultural hygge. And blaring out at the front of the pack, honking the horn of his GT and yelling \"ANOTHER ONE\" into the blazing Florida sun, their King, their Lord, their wholesome, positive, sunbeam of a God: DJ Khaled. \nIt's 6.50PM and I've completed The Key . I feel energised, born anew. I feel positive. There's an awards ceremony I am going to and I am convinced I am going to win. Why turn up to an awards ceremony unless you are going to win? This is the Tao of Khaled. I sing \" All I do is win, win, win / no matter what \" under my breath. I turn down free beer and wine. \"I drink to celebrate, now,\" I say, gravely. Keep your face clean. Keep your heart clean. Clear eyes, full hearts can't lose. I am with my friends. I will let them share in my success. They will walk with me now on the pathway to more success. Success will lead to bag security. Maybe I— maybe, after I win this, I will actually write that book. Khaled can write a book. Why can't I write a book? I'm too preoccupied with first lines. There is a Khaled quote running through my head: \"Those who have a hundred percent chance of losing are the people who never try.\" He's right. How can I win if I don't even play? \nIt starts now. It starts with this success. Success leads to more success. A win is followed by a win. I am DJ Khaled now, his spirit imbues me. I am strong and I am humble. I am powerful and positive. I am looking up, not down. Forward, not back. \"They\" don't want me to win, so I'm going to win. And then I'm going to win again. And again. And buy a house in Miami, next to DJ Khaled and Rick Ross. And have lunch with them every day. I can see it: me, in a tropical shirt, not even close to buttons, billowing in the wind as I lean Jesus-arms out the top of a Maybach. Will it into existence and so it shall be. I am ready for my new life as a suc— \nWe lose.

Scott Applewhite, File) \nSenate Republicans plan to repeal Obamacare. That’s what’s known. It’s what they do after that that’s the mystery. \nReconciliation — a budget loophole through which Senators could pass legislation by a simple majority and block a potential Democratic filibuster — was floated for a minute . House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy then suggested it would be easier to decide on a replacement after Obamacare was repealed and “you will have, hopefully, fewer people playing politics.” \nOn Tuesday, GOP leadership eluded giving a timeline. \n“What we intend to do is go forward with a process after the first of the year and begin the opportunity to repeal and replace, so that will start shortly after we reconvene, after the swearing in,” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill, according to Talking Points Memo . \n“Its gonna take us awhile to make that transition from the repeal to actually replacing it with more affordable health coverage, which provides people better access,” said Senate majority whip John Cornyn. “There is a lot to do so it’s not going to happen overnight.” \nStill, the general consensus seemed to be: repeal then replace. \n“I’m from a state that has an expanded Medicaid population that I am very concerned about,” West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said. “I don’t want to throw them off into the cold, and I don’t think that’s a strategy that I want to see. It’s too many people. That’s over 200,000 people in my state. So we need a transition. I think we’ll repeal and then we’ll work during the transition period for the replacement vehicle.” \nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso blamed his Democratic colleagues — who “messed it up thoroughly over six years” — for the indeterminate amount of time between repealing Obamacare and replacing it. \n“There’s not a quick 2,000-page replacement,” he said. “It’s an ongoing process. It’s going to transition and take a number of years to do that.” Brendan Gauthier is assistant editor at Salon.",

    "text": "5 reasons the Packers will lose their fifth straight game Monday vs. the Eagles By Cameron DaSilva Nov 28, 2016 12:28p ET 0Shares It'll be five straight losses for the Packers \nIt’s not often that the Green Bay Packers experience a free fall as December approaches. At this time, they’re typically being discussed as Super Bowl contenders with their eyes set on the playoffs. \nNot this season. \nThe Packers are 4-6 and are rapidly watching their postseason hopes go by the wayside thanks to their struggling defense and an offense that fails to generate points with any sort of consistency. Yes, Aaron Rodgers has been worse than we expected, and yes, they’ve dealt with a handful of crushing injuries, but the NFL doesn’t care for excuses. The Packers need wins in the worst way possible, having lost four straight entering Monday night's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. \nWill they get a much-needed victory? No, and here’s why. 1 Carson Wentz is facing a reeling defense \nThe Eagles' rookie QB has struggled in recent weeks. Some of that can be attributed to the fact that he’s faced the Seahawks, Falcons, Giants and Vikings in four of his last five games, but his numbers have been mediocre against even average defenses. Wentz will get a bit of a break on Monday night against the Packers, who as it stands, have a below-average defense. They’re 29th in points allowed and 17th in yards allowed and are allowing the ninth-most passing yards per game. In the past four weeks, they’ve allowed an average of 420 total yards per game, which is atrocious. \nThe pass rush has been decent this season, recording 24 sacks in 10 games, but most of that has come from one guy: Nick Perry. He has seven of the 24, and if the Eagles can get him under control, they’ll be in good shape. The Packers have had two sacks in each of the last four games, but that’s far from a dominant trend. They’ll need to get significant pressure on Wentz up the middle to have any shot at creating turnovers, and that’s not likely to happen. Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports Eric Hartline 2 Green Bay’s secondary is depleted \nThe biggest weakness of Green Bay’s defense is the secondary. Sam Shields is out for the year, Damarious Randall hasn’t played since Oct. 16, and Quinten Rollins has struggled mightily this season. The Packers gave up four 50-yard plays in the fourth quarter against the Redskins last week, which is concerning in its own right. Now take into account that no team had allowed that many in the fourth quarter all season. \nWentz doesn’t throw it downfield all that often, but he certainly has the arm to do so when called upon. Doug Pederson will see that weakness in the Packers’ defense and take shots deep, knowing they’re vulnerable to big plays. Wentz hasn’t faced a secondary as bad as this one since he hung 301 yards on the Steelers in Week 3, posting a career-high passer rating of 125.9. Ray Carlin-USA TODAY Sports Raymond Carlin III 3 The Packers' receivers don’t get separation \nMuch of the blame this season has been put on Aaron Rodgers, and that’s warranted to a point. However, he’s far from the Packers’ biggest issue on offense. His receivers simply don’t get any separation from defensive backs, which tightens the windows Rodgers has to throw into. It makes it difficult for him to complete passes, even on throws that he routinely makes. The Eagles don’t have an elite secondary by any means, but their defensive backs are versatile. Malcolm Jenkins is physical in the slot and can match up well with whichever receiver comes into his area. Leodis McKelvin is healthy after exiting last week’s game with a concussion, and rookie Jalen Mills will continue to see time at corner. It doesn’t take a top-flight corner to make Rodgers’ throwing windows smaller, and the Eagles will prove that Monday. AP Vincent Pugliese 4 The Eagles will shut down the Packers’ run game \nThe Packers are 26th in the league in rushing, tallying just 1,006 yards on the year. The Eagles, on the other hand, are 10th against the run, allowing 1,057 yards this season. Obviously, this doesn’t bode well for the Packers’ struggling ground attack, particularly with Fletcher Cox and Bennie Logan in the middle. \nPackers offensive linemen J.C. Tretter and T.J. Lang both will be out Monday night, meaning blocking Cox and Logan will be a tall task for the Packers’ backup linemen. They will pose a serious threat to the Packers’ lackluster ground attack, which will make Green Bay one-dimensional on offense, as it has been all season. James Starks doesn’t scare opposing defenses, and Christine Michael isn’t certain to have much of an impact for the Packers in his second week with the team. Associated Press Alex Brandon 5 The game is in Philadelphia \nOnly two teams in the NFL are undefeated at home this season: the Seahawks and the Eagles. It’s surprising, but it’s absolutely true, and it’s mostly thanks to Philadelphia's stellar defense at Lincoln Financial Field. The Eagles have allowed just three touchdowns at home this season, one on the ground and two through the air. That trend will continue against the Packers’ sputtering offense, particularly when playing on the road. \nRodgers and the Packers are 1-4 away from Lambeau this season. Rodgers has similar numbers at home and on the road, but one number stands out: sacks. He’s been sacked twice as much on the road (16 to eight) this season, which obviously impacts his play.

    "text": "IT HAS a day spa named after Ivanka and a Presidential Suite to die for.\nBut the Trump International Hotel could bring the real estate mogul’s time in the Oval Office to an abrupt end.\nA Harvard Law professor says President-elect Donald Trump could be impeached the moment he takes office over comments made to foreign diplomats.\nDuring a gathering at his new, spare-no-expense hotel in Washington DC, Mr Trump wined and dined visiting officials in the opulence of the hotel’s Lincoln Library, a junior ballroom with 16-foot ceilings and velvet drapes.\nEthical concerns were raised after a number of delegates admitted they would be tempted to stay at the hotel when visiting the US capital, in a bid to curry favour with the President.\n“Believe me, all the delegations will go there,” one Middle Eastern diplomat told the Washington Post.\n“Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ Isn’t it rude to come to his city and say, ‘I am staying at your competitor?’” said another.\nmedia_camera Mr Trump has been urged to divest ownership of his new hotel. Picture: Chip Somodevilla\nMr Trump built the hotel inside the former Post Office Pavilion, which his company leased from the US Federal Government in a 60-year deal worth $US180 million.\nCommentators have flagged this as an “unprecedented and intolerable” conflict of interest that puts the integrity of federal procurement at risk, calling on Mr Trump to step down from running his company or for the government to terminate the lease.\nBut a more dramatic conclusion could be in order, with legal experts backing the possibility that the hotelier could face impeachment when he becomes President in January.\nRichard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W Bush, believes that Trump breached the US Constitution by schmoozing with diplomats at his swanky hotel.\nThe officials’ attempt to get on Trump’s good side by staying in his hotel “looks like a gift,” Prof Painter told ThinkProgress, which argued that the President-elect was “actively soliciting business from agents of foreign governments”.\nmedia_camera “Why would you stay anywhere else?” Picture: Supplied\nAnd toning down his approach one in office would not save Mr Trump, the analysis said, because “the message that diplomats can earn the favour of the new president by staying in his hotels has already been received, and it can’t exactly be unsaid”.\nThinkProgress argues that this would breach the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which states that federal officials may only do business with foreign government if they do not receive “special treatment”, Prof Painter said.\nHarvard Professor of Constitutional Laurence Tribe weighted in on Twitter, backing the ThinkProgress analysis. If Mr Trump was impeached, Vice President-elect Mike Pence would take his place as President.\nIt is not the first time impeachment has been raised in regards to Mr Trump; A law professor at the University of Utah has argued that the Trump University debacle alone is enough to impeach him on.\nArticle II of the US Constitution provides that the President “shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours”.\nBut, unless some kind of Republican conspiracy is afoot, it is unlikely to happen before 2018, since the GOP will control both the House of Representatives and the Senate when Mr Trump takes office.\nmedia_camera The Trump clan could rake in extra cash because of their patriarch’s job. Pic: Getty\nHOW IS A PRESIDENT IMPEACHED?\nHere’s the full section from Article II of the US Constitution:\n“The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours.”\nSo the President is sackable. If Mr Trump did something outrageous enough to justify his removal from office, there is a constitutional mechanism that could make it happen.\nWe’re fairly sure Mr Trump hasn’t committed treason or bribery, so that leaves “other high crimes and misdemeanours” as the possible justification for his impeachment. The definition of that is pretty vague.\nSay, hypothetically, Mr Trump has done something appropriately awful. The next step is for the House of Representatives to pass articles of impeachment with a simple majority. At that point, the President has officially been impeached.\nThen he faces a trial in the Senate, presided over by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. At the moment, that’s Justice John Roberts, who was appointed by George W. Bush. At the end of the trial the Senate votes, and a two-thirds majority is required for a conviction.\nIf he’s convicted, the President is removed from office. In this case, that would result in Mike Pence becoming the new President.\nmedia_camera Mr Trump would put up a fight.\nIT’S HAPPENED BEFORE\nTwo previous presidents have been impeached. The first, Andrew Johnson, was tried for violating the Tenure of Office Act, and acquitted in 1868. It was as boring as it sounds. The second, Bill Clinton, was impeached on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in the wake of the Lewinsky scandal, and was also acquitted.\nRichard Nixon was almost impeached over Watergate, but resigned as president before the necessary resolutions could pass in the House of Representatives.\nSo, there is precedent here. But ultimately, the probability of a push for impeachment succeeding is dependent on public opinion.\n“Ninety-nine per cent of the game is how popular is the president,” Bruce Fein, who was involved in the Clinton impeachment, told Politico in April. If President Trump’s approval rating is high, no one will dare to move against him.\ndana.mccauley@news.com.au\nTrump outlines his plans for the U.S in first interview 0:30 Donald Trump has revealed his plans on removing criminals from the US in his first interview.

    "text": "Queen's University students who attended a controversial costume party  last weekend could be punished for violating the school's code of conduct  — a set of rules implemented by many universities that includes off-campus, non-academic behaviour.\nBut Timothy Boyle, a Calgary-based lawyer who has represented students involved in university disciplinary cases, said many schools may be extending their authority too far.\n\"Fair enough they have certain standards to expect of you as a student while you're on campus,\" he said. \"But now ... they want to extend themselves past their university boundaries and start regulating [students'] affairs while they are off campus. That has to be a great concern.\"\n​ Daniel Woolf, principal and vice chancellor of Queen's University, has said the university is investigating the off-campus party, an event that sparked accusations of racism. The party included students dressed up as Middle Eastern sheiks, Buddhist monks, Viet Cong fighters in rice hats and Mexican prisoners.\nSome of the students dressed up as Viet Cong fighters wearing rice hats. (Twitter)\n\n\n\"We do have a student code of conduct which was revised last year,\" Woolf said. \"Once we've concluded our investigation, if appropriate, there are actions that can be taken under the code.\"\nQueen's code of conduct says students are \"expected to adhere to and promote the university's core values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and personal responsibility in all aspects of university life, academic and non-academic.\"\nRacists, dummies and bad costumes: Robyn  Urback ​ ​ Queen's investigates 'shockingly racist' costume party The code can apply to non-academic misconduct that occurs on or off university property. For example, a student can be considered in breach of the code if his or her conduct \"has a real and substantial connection to the legitimate interests of the university, which include, but are not limited to, its reputation or goodwill in the community.\"\nUp to the schools \n\nGreg Ko, a Toronto-based civil litigator who works on cases involving university disciplinary proceedings, said it's really up to each university to figure out how far it wants its code of conduct to apply.\n\"In this case here, Queen's could very well determine that its reputation or goodwill in the community is affected or that other students' interests are affected as well.\"\nStudents can criticize prof on Facebook, court rules \n\nUniversities have always had academic conduct standards that deal with infractions such as cheating and plagiarism. But about 25 years ago, schools started introducing non-academic standards, Boyle said.\n\n\n\"They brought in this almost moral code that you had to conduct yourself in a certain way.\"\nOther partygoers dressed as Mexican prisoners. (Twitter)\n\nBut Boyle wonders how far a university might go. For example, would a school take disciplinary action against a student for running a stop sign and crashing into a car driven by one of his professors?\n\"The principle is exactly the same when they're catching these students off campus and saying, 'We don't like the way you're conducting yourself.'\"\nFacebook case \nBoyle represented twin brothers Keith and Steven Pridgen , whom the University of Calgary found guilty of non-academic misconduct in 2007. The two had posted critical remarks in a Facebook group devoted to complaints about one of their professors.\nThe brothers argued their charter rights had been violated and that they had a right to free speech. Alberta's highest court agreed.\nBut Boyle said this decision was an anomaly. He said courts generally have agreed that universities are in a \"charter-free zone\" and don't have to adhere to its principles because they are private organizations, although publicly funded. Section 32 states the charter only applies to the government, not private institutions.\n\"So therefore, the universities are free to do whatever they want. If they want to limit freedom, they can limit freedoms,\" Boyle said.\n\nPlus, if the Queen's students are punished for their actions at the party, Boyle says they would have a tough time arguing their freedom of expression had been violated. \nQueen's students speak out about 'racist' costume party 2:44\nThe Pridgen brothers, he said, were on much stronger ground, constitutionally, because they were expressing their opinions about a professor. The Queen's partygoers were having fun, and not taking a political stance.\n\"So, the standard for giving them that freedom, wouldn't be as great,\" Boyle said.\nHe said the issue with the Queen's students really isn't about the Constitution but the jurisdictional reach of the university.\n\"This is where universities are really extending themselves.\"\nRacists, dummies and bad costumes: Robyn  Urback ​ ​ Queen's investigates 'shockingly racist' costume party But Michael McDonald, executive director of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, said institutions shouldn't be bystanders and that they play a unique role in the education, as well as the development of many young adults.\nCodes of conduct can help facilitate these roles and generally don't amount to overreach by the universities, he said.\n\"We think that they can play important roles, especially when they're open, clear and they involve input from the rest of the community in those discussions and they are applied in a fair manner.\"",

    "text": "'Apprentice' cast say Trump is a sexist pig \nDonald Trump’s stunning win in the 2016 presidential election has sparked a global spike in interest in old episodes of “The Apprentice,” a data analytics firm has found. \nPeople around the world are looking to the show, which ran on NBC for 14 seasons over more than a decade, to get some clues about the kind of person Trump will be as leader of the free world come inauguration day. \nWared Seger, the co-founder of Parrot Analytics, a measurement company that helps international TV executives gauge interest in TV properties, told The Post that over the past three months, audience demand for “The Apprentice,” has quadrupled. \nThe show’s demand index rose significantly when the President-elect won the primaries — then again on Sept. 11 and when he won the election earlier this month. \nParrot Analytics’ demand index draws data from video streaming services, Wikipedia searches, file sharing sites, searches, social media commentary and blogs. \nA surge in value for the library of “The Apprentice” and “Celebrity Apprentice” could be a financial boon for both Trump and MGM as both own the archive along with the series creator Mark Burnett. \nMGM and Mark Burnett have been fielding a huge number of calls about ways to extend the franchise and for straight sales to broadcasters, a source close to the property confirmed. Photo: AP \n“There are plans to exploit different things,” said a person familiar with ‘The Apprentice.” \n“There’s been a lot of global interest,” the person said. “With a great format like that there are always opportunities for exploiting it further. The demand is huge.” \n“Celebrity Apprentice,” is currently airing on streaming video service, Hulu. “The New Celebrity Apprentice,” hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger, begins in January on NBC. \nTrump, who will become the 45th president of the Uniter States on Jan. 20, has been under fire for potential conflicts of interest with his Trump Organization, a sprawling real estate and licensing firm. \nTrump was represented during the long run of “The Apprentice” by several talent agencies, including William Morris Agency and Endeavor which later merged to become WME. \nOn Sunday, WME boss Ari Emanuel visited Trump in New Jersey but the two are said to have not discussed business, according to sources. \nWME acquired the Miss Universe Organization from the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization and a rep for MGM did not immediately respond for comment. Share this: ",

    "text": "Co-Founder of Scripted.com, CEO The Bold Italic, Columnist @Inc. 15 hrs ago “Bedtime” by Puja Saraiya Abid You haven’t posted all day. Your Facebook timeline doesn’t look quite right. What will your friends think? You have an audience to keep happy for your second job. You are your own social media manager. You are your own branding consultant. Your personal brand matters to the world because you are important. People care what you think and need to hear from you. Time to get to work. What should you share today? Today could be the day you change the world with a Facebook post. You browse your News Feed for inspiration. So many good posts today — every good post you read gives you anxiety. How can I top what my friends say? You need to win. You are better than them. Facebook has become the de facto place to share your political views. Those get a lot of likes but run a high-risk profile. Should you share a politically charged article with a clever caption? Everyone has the same views as you, so your posts won’t matter anyway. Oh wait — except for that one alt-right friend of yours. And the alt-left fruititarian friend who called for a ban on Whole Foods products because they broke a seal’s nail during a cargo transfer in Alaska. You later discovered that that news story was fake. Your friends commented on your alt-left-friend's post, but he still insists it’s true. After all, it was trending. What about a sunset? Or a picture of your last meal? The one you cooked at home. You are such a talented chef. You know how to perfectly cook meat (caption: “perfectly cooked rack of lamb — took only 12 hours!”). Everyone will be so impressed. No — not deep enough — you need to demonstrate more depth of character. Maybe you can change the world with a brilliant insight about labor economics. That Daily Mail article illustrates your point perfectly. But wait. Daily Mail . You can’t share anything from Daily Mail  — it’s not authoritative enough for you. You have editorial standards. What will your friends think if you don’t share from the New York Times , the Atlantic or the New Yorker ? It won’t meet their standards. It won’t meet your standards. You’ll be secretly judged. You can’t have that. Move on. The News Feed flashes before your eyes. It’s moving too fast. You are running out of time. You need to post soon. Maybe you could share something personal? Maybe you could share a picture of your family. But last time that was a disaster. Your family didn’t get as many likes as your friend’s family. You posted to Facebook and Twitter via Instagram — maybe that was the reason. Maybe you should have used the Amaro filter instead of the Valencia filter on Instagram. Your family is cute. There is no way in a totally controlled environment your friends’ family could have possibly gotten more likes than your family. They won this round—54–41 — but you’ll get the next one. Next time you’ll stage the picture properly. Every time a family member posts a picture of you, you untag yourself. You are too cool for that shit. Gotta keep up appearances. You don’t need that polluting your timeline. “Race Day” by Puja Saraiya Abid . What about changing your profile picture? That would be a major shake-up. You’d get a ton of likes. Maybe you could use that selfie from a jungle in Guatemala. Or that picture of you looking contemplative on a beach. Or the other one of you jumping, where the camera caught you midair in a smile. Maybe the one where you are at the finish line of a marathon. What about the one where you’re nursing a baby alpaca back to health? You look so caring in that picture. So nurturing. So happy. Everyone will love it. You will be showered with adoration. On second thought, maybe that’s too big of a change for today. You browse Facebook for inspiration. You see a status update from John. Years ago, the two of you got into a fight. Is it time to reconcile? Is it time to extend an olive branch? You like his status. Maybe he will reach out. Maybe this is an indication that the two of you are “cool” now. You are filled with hope, and you are wondering what he is thinking. Maybe he will feel the same. You also like your ex’s status. Maybe she will notice, you think wistfully. Who is that woman with Ken? Didn’t he just get divorced? You secretly judge. You “love” his picture. You have to make sure he doesn’t know how you really feel. What is that random political rant Talia just posted? You think about a comment you could post in response. But you refrain. No politics, sex or religion in your News Feed or comments. You want to make sure the social-justice warriors don’t skewer you. That would be bad. You have to abide by their rules to live a happy social media life. Don’t deviate too much from their thoughts, and you’ll be fine. You switch to your mobile phone because you are tired and need to lie down. You are exhausted. You take an Ambien. You are lucid only for another 15 minutes, so you’d better post quickly. What is Facebook’s algorithm displaying on your phone as compared to your desktop? Is it different? What does this teach you about their algorithm? Let’s see. You scan your phone. You look at the top of the News Feed — it’s Annu. Why the fuck does Annu’s grandma like every one of his statuses and post some weird religious comment on each one? That’s weird as all hell. And he posts a picture of his baby literally every day with some emotional comment. They all look staged. How on earth does he have time for that? You don’t have time for that. You’ve just spent two hours on social media. Oh God. There’s Sean posting again about his company. They raised another $5M dollars. He’s “humbled and grateful.” What a crock — he is the least “humble” humble person you know. And his profile picture — so appalling — that black-and-white picture of him speaking at a conference looking contemplative and waving his hands in the air makes you cringe. You hope his company fails — you hate watching him succeed. You like his status. You comment, “Congrats!” Exclamation points are important. They show real enthusiasm and emotion. What does his company even do? You scroll down farther. There’s more to learn. There go Martina and Yusuf posting another vacation selfie again. They are always kissing each other in photos. Why on earth can’t they spare you just once from the intimacies of their life? They must be fucking other people. They must be masking the relative mediocrity in other areas of their lives by posting selfies. It looks like they make 15 attempts at each picture before posting. It’s not possible to perfectly purse your lips like that every single time. You are such a good person. You are not like them. More scrolling. More liking. You can’t stop liking Facebook status updates. You are so generous. You feel like Santa Claus. You are probably making some of your friends’ days — especially the ones who posted updates that previously had no likes. What a terrible day for inspiration, though. You look back on your own photos to see what might be useful. You smile at your mobile photos of your trip to Austin. There are the pictures from your college graduation. You look back at your wedding album. Those were good times. There are the pictures of you at the hospital with your firstborn. You took all the right pictures, but were you really ever there? You search Twitter — you see what’s trending. Maybe if you post about a trending topic, it will get more traction. You check what’s trending on Facebook too. You go on Instagram and try out a few hashtags. You want to see what’s being searched for to maximize success. Stirring the pot by posing an open-ended question is never a terrible strategy — maybe you can try that? You are data driven. You are a genius at this social stuff. No one can do this better than you. No one can duplicate the method you’ve put together. A clever “someecard”. You look at a few celebrity accounts. What is Gary Vaynerchuk posting about? What is Tim Ferriss posting about? What about George Takei — he’s so clever. You aim to be like him. Maybe you should just share one of his posts? Maybe you should post a someecard? Those usually do well. But no. You want to be original. Maybe you can take something he posted about and paraphrase it a bit. No one will notice. Eureka! You have it. You have the status update you’ve been waiting for. It took a long time, but you finally got there. It meets your editorial standards and the editorial standards of your own personal echo chamber. You post it. You feel satisfied. You feel relieved. This one is going to do well. Two minutes pass — your first like — Kristin. She doesn’t count. She likes all your status updates. She couldn’t possibly have read the article attached to it. She liked it within five seconds. Does she have a crush on you? Coincidentally, she can’t seem to figure out how to stop sending you Candy Crush notifications. Someone should let her know — just not you, and not today. More likes. More validation. You feel good — you feel high. This one is going to do well — it’s on the right trajectory. Mission accomplished. Nice work. Your job is almost done. Now you just have to worry about Snapchat, Instagram, LinkedIn, Medium and Twitter. The world is waiting to hear from you. How many shares will this receive?",

    "text": "10 things for NASCAR fans to be thankful for By Tom Jensen Nov 23, 2016 4:22p ET 0Shares 10 things for NASCAR fans to be thakful for \nIt’s Thanksgiving time, one of our favorite holidays of the entire year. And with the 2016 NASCAR season just concluded last Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway, it’s appropriate to give thanks for a remarkable year. Here are 10 things to be thankful about in terms of the racing: Getty Images Getty Images 10 Daytona 500 \nThe Daytona 500 wound up with the closest finish since the advent of electronic timing and scoring in 1993, as Denny Hamlin edged out Martin Truex Jr. by 0.010 seconds in a thrilling battle. Getty Images Getty Images 9 Low downforce package \nFor 2016, NASCAR dramatically reduced the downforce on the Cup cars. And the aero cuts produced much better racing, especially in the first half of the year, before crew chiefs and engineers figured out how to get most of it back. The good news is there will another reduction for 2017. Getty Images Getty Images 8 Throwback weekend \nDarlington Raceway’s throwback weekend was even better the second time around than it was the first time, as teams came up with some truly amazing special paint schemes to honor the legends of the past. Getty Images Getty Images 7 Young guns \nNASCAR has never had this much young talent coming into the sport at once. Chase Elliott and Chris Buescher became the first rookies to make the Chase since Denny Hamlin in 2006, and there are a ton of great young drivers out there, including Ryan Blaney, Bubba Wallace, William Byron, Cole Custer … the list goes on and on and on. 6 XFINITY and Truck Series chases \nFor the first time, NASCAR used the Chase format in the XFINITY and Camping World Truck Series. Monterrey, Mexico, native Daniel Suarez scored a historic victory in the XFINITY Chase, becoming the first foreign-born driver to win a championship. And veteran Johnny Sauter scored a popular title in the Truck Series. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 5 Parity \nWhen all was said and done 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson won five races, most of any driver. But seven other drivers from four other teams won either three or four races, and all three manufacturers were represented in the Chase finale. That’s competitive balance. Getty Images Getty Images 4 Both Phoenix races \nThe first Phoenix race saw Kevin Harvick and Carl Edwards trade paint all the way down the front-stretch, with Harvick winning by 0.010 seconds, the same margin of victory as the Daytona 500. The second one saw a crazy finish with Matt Kenseth appearing headed for victory, only to crash out late, allowing Joey Logano to win. 3 Smoke's last ride \nWhen Tony Stewart broke his back in an off-road accident in late January, outside expectations for the season weren’t very high. But Stewart put on a dazzling drive at Sonoma, passing Denny Hamlin on the last corner of the last lap to race his way into the Chase in his final season. 2 A 7-time champ \nWe will be talking about the end of the Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway for years to come, maybe decades. After Carl Edwards crashed trying to block Joey Logano, Jimmie Johnson made two perfect restarts to win his record-tying seventh NASCAR Premier Series championship. There is no question that Johnson is the best driver of his era and he’s making a strong case at best ever. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 1 Race fans \nA special shout out to all the NASCAR fans who come to races, watch them on television, read about them on the internet and care passionately about their favorite drivers. You are the reason those of us who work in the sport have jobs and can provide for our families. We can never thank you enough for your support, which allows us to do what we love to do. Thank you and Happy Holidays to all!",

    "text": "I n 1998, I joined the UK launch team for an e-commerce startup named after the world’s largest river. The smart idea was to harness the unprecedented cataloguing capacity of the emerging internet to sell books – a product with a long shelf-life – online. In those days, now regarded as the classical era in tech history, the boundary between the product consumed and the medium used to deliver it was clear.\nIncreasingly, the boundary between product and platform is dissolving before our eyes. First, we offered the freedom of the biggest selection of books in the world. Then we said: “If you liked that, you will like this.” We were following you into the bookshop, recording your purchasing history and suggesting your future. It started with books, but it was always intended to be everything, in the end.\nTwo years later, in 2000, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig predicted that the internet would become an apparatus that tracks our every move, erasing important aspects of privacy and free speech in our social and political lives. “Left to itself,” he said, “cyberspace will become a perfect tool of control.” A sceptical reviewer scoffed : “Lessig doesn’t offer much proof that a Soviet-style loss of privacy and freedom is on its way.”\nSixteen years later, it’s clear that the digital world born in freedom has evolved into a creature of control. Post-Snowden, we know the scale of NSA and GCHQ surveillance . We know we’re being watched. But equally, we might consider that the employee who decides what does and doesn’t go on Facebook for its 1.79 billion active users is the most powerful censor in the world. Do you know her name?\nThe pedlars of fake news are corroding democracy | Andrew Smith Read more \nWe also know that corporate internet giants gather data to maximise profits from our consumer habits, from grocery shopping to TV viewing patterns. Just like trawlers with dragnets, all sorts of other collateral data gets hauled in along the way. Data surveillance, once intangible and invisible, now blatantly announces its presence in our everyday lives. Mobile accessories and the interconnectivity between gadgets and appliances in our homes – the internet of things – create an unprecedented network of tracking devices capturing data for commerce and government.\nThe technology we thought we were using to make life more efficient started using us some time ago. It is now attempting to reshape our social behaviour into patterns reminiscent of the total surveillance culture of the medieval village, East Germany under the Stasi, or the white supremacist state of South Africa in which I grew up.\nIn an increasingly online everyday life, our use of social media has become a medium for normalising the acceptability of intrusion and behavioural correction. We are bombarded by “helpful recommendations” on education, health, relationships, taxes and leisure matched to our tracked user profiles that nudge us towards products and services to make us better citizen consumers. The app told you that you only took 100 steps today. The ad for the running shoes will arrive tomorrow.\nWe risk allowing ourselves to become a vast network of informants on each other and ourselves. Think about GPS-based location tracking on your mobile phone; think about social media apps where we broadcast our spontaneous thoughts, social lives and relationships.\nFacebook isn't looking out for your privacy. It wants your data for itself Read more \nAs individuals we behave on a spectrum of complicity with the demise of our privacy. We know Twitter is broadcasting. We’re generally naive about the limits to our visibility and history on Facebook . We’re in self-denial where there ought to be a reasonable expectation of privacy, as with texts, emails and online shopping. In truth we already know nothing’s private because the corporates and government can get it anyway. And the icing on the cake is that we are paying for our surveillance out of our own hard-pressed pockets.\nWhether the internet is a “public good” is a question that has so far focused primarily on anxiety about government intervention into our digital lives. We are rightly concerned that Donald Trump will soon get his hands on the NSA, and that Britain’s snooper’s charter legitimises rather than limits the vast intrusions exposed by Snowden. But just as the internet knows no international borders, neither does it recognise outmoded distinctions between state and corporate power, citizens and consumers and platforms and products.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘So this is the action I’m taking.’ Patrick McGoohan as Number Six in the TV series The Prisoner. Photograph: Channel 4 \nThe fact that billions of us now use a handful of corporate-owned global platforms to manage pretty much every aspect of our daily lives indicates how fast the potential of digital culture is shrinking. A tectonic rift exists between the corporate apparatuses of Google, Facebook, WhatsApp (now owned by Facebook), Twitter , Apple and Amazon, and the open source and creative commons ideals of the “internet of public good”.\nOur concern about government snooping sometimes distracts from self-awareness of our complicity as consumers of products so ubiquitous they have become everyday verbs.\nSo, I’m going to act. Of course there are all sorts of measures we can take to improve our internet security. Using encryption and password managers, securing our sources. We can even put our mobile phone in a heavy copper purse and drag it round with us. But while there are tools we can use to avoid surveillance and hackers, as a consumer I’m trying to avoid or limit using services offered by corporates who don’t pay their taxes; are idolisers of borderless free trade but arch-enemies of the international labour movement; are destroying privacy and creating an architecture of commercial surveillance of every aspect of our existence.\n2007, not 2016, is the year the world turned upside down | John Naughton Read more \nThe so-called hippy libertarians in Silicon Valley are more like unelected tyrants. They demand free speech and low tax to suit them but impose de facto censorship, surveillance and behavioural correction on us. No privacy for us and barely any scrutiny of them. The barons who own the digital kingdom that most of us inhabit declare themselves libertarians but not when our liberties are at stake.\nNone of the internet giants has unionised employees . Trade unionists are derided by Silicon Valley as modern-day luddites. But the recent landmark UK court ruling that Uber drivers are not self-employed demonstrates that the gig economy does not, in the words of TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady , have to be a rigged economy. “Our role isn’t to try to stop this progress, it’s to make sure that technology is used to make working people’s lives better, and to make sure the gains from new technology are fairly shared.”\nI’m also worried about how we use social media. The so-called neutral platforms facilitate hate against women, racism and homophobia, and they may have put Trump in the White House as well. It may not be the platform itself, but the way in which it favours those outside the conventional media establishment and its notions of balance. Analytics expert Laeeq Khan suggests a behavioural change in our social media habits: “As social media consumers, we should resist limiting ourselves to an echo chamber of like-minded voices.”\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Crooked Hillary should not be allowed to run for president. She deleted 33,000 e-mails AFTER getting a subpoena from U.S. Congress. RIGGED!\nNovember 1, 2016 Trump dominated rivals on social media. He tweeted, Facebooked and Instagrammed directly to followers, apparently personally and spontaneously. It wasn’t necessarily the content that people identified with, but the carefully crafted lack of spin. This modern-day Big Brother mastered Twitter by propagating a sense of immediacy, blatant expression and human risk, rather than balance and caution. What Trump tweeted at 3am, the mainstream media reported the next day.\nSo this is the action I’m taking. I have stopped using Google as my search engine and deactivated my Facebook account. WhatsApp followed when it announced in August that it had abandoned its principled pro-privacy stance and would share data with its new parent and others in the “Facebook family of companies”. I’m putting on my tin hat, dusting off my open-source kitbag, and heading off to the dark woods to join the resistance. Like Patrick McGoohan playing Number 6 in The Prisoner, I expect it’s going to take many failed attempts to try to escape the Village .",

It’s unclear if he wears Express off the court. \nBy Steven Kutz Deputy Personal Finance Editor \nA look at what NBA players do with their money shows they spend a lot on Apple AAPL, -0.01% products, and at the stores Whole Foods WFM, -0.73% , Target TGT, -0.80% and Neiman Marcus, among others. No surprises there. But they spend by far the most of their money at the clothing store Express EXPR, +0.00% Yes, Express. A store that until 2000 only sold women’s clothing. \nThe NBA Players Association teamed up with the personal finance app Personal Capital last fall to help players keep track of their spending, benefits and net worth. \nAlso see: This NFL player slept in a utility closet in college to save money \nSo far, 50 of the league’s roughly 440 players are using the app regularly, according to Mark Goines, Personal Capital’s chief marketing officer. \nOne possible explanation for all the spending at Express is that the league’s current Most Valuable Player, Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors, was a brand ambassador for the chain from December 2014 to December 2015. \nExpress President and chief executive David Kornberg said he was “thrilled” to hear that players were shopping so much at his stores. \n“Express is all about offering our customers...fashion in a way that fits their individual lifestyles. While our partnership with Stephen Curry has ended, we continue to partner with professional athletes, including our current men’s brand ambassador, Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs,” he told MarketWatch. \nPersonal Capital compiled data from December 2015 to March 2016 and shared with MarketWatch what it has learned about the players’ finances. For example, the average 401(k) balance of the 50 players, who are a mix of both veterans and guys who are new to the league, is $338,951. \nAlso see: What it’s like to take a finance class with a lot of NFL players \nThe average NBA salary for the 2013-2014 season was roughly $5 million . Rookies make a predetermined salary based on where they are drafted. For the 2015-2016 season, the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft made $4.7 million, and the No. 30 pick made $940,000. \nWhen it comes to spending, the players average an outlay of $42,498 a month . One player spent a noteworthy $501,000 between December and March. Where’s all that money going? Here’s a breakdown: Also see",

I’m not cynical and I do believe in love, but I also know that love isn’t always enough for a relationship to survive to “ till death do us part”. \nSo what is the solution? Is it time we created a new type of marriage, one that occurs for a set period of time? Surely the goal of marriage shouldn’t be lasting until the end no matter how unhappy we are.\nMany of us determine a successful marriage as one that lasts, and when it ends the words “failed” are used. But if two people are no longer making each other happy and have tried as hard as they can to fix their problems, should going their separate ways be considered failure or strength for doing what’s right for them and possibly their children too?\nMany divorcees will admit that their marriages had not been working for some time but it was the idea of failing at something that kept them there.\nSo let’s consider what would happen if marriage was just a more serious form of a relationship and that we didn’t assume it would always last forever.\nCasey Beros and her husband recently got married and they decided not to put ‘till death do us part’ in their vows. Source: Supplied \nIt might feel awkward and something a hopefulness romantic like me shouldn’t say, but admitting that a relationship can end in divorce could help you appreciate what you do have in life and love.\nEmma Johnson, author of wealthysinglemum.com believes in a ten year marriage contract and she could be onto something. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the medium duration for marriage that ends in divorce is 12 years.\nShe explains that at the beginning you lay out the goals for the marriage (something so many of us don’t do anyway) and create a super-size prenup like document that not only outlines what will happen in terms of finances and children if you do decide to split but also the goals for the marriage.\nAs the couple approaches nine years they sit down and decide if they want to amicably part ways, or renew their contact and make changes and new goals for the next phase of life, love and marriage.\nIf a couple decides not to renew their contact they can split and instead of saying they failed at something are able to celebrate that they completed a ten year marriage contract.\nDoes this embrace more how people are actually living these days? It might feel beyond many of us to enter a relationship like this, but should we live according to a fairytale and traditions or open our eyes and work with what is actually happening?\nKaty and Brian are getting married in the next few weeks and say they are taking a modern approach to marriage, firstly by eliminating the words “till death do us part, forsaking all others” from their vows.\n“There is too much pressure on marriage,” says Katy. “Those vows step too far outside of living in the now and being in a relationships because there is no one else you would rather be with, not because you feel like you are bound to stay”.\nBrian admits, “We are competing with a high divorce percentage, and we have to continue to work out how we want to live our lives — that doesn’t end when you get married”.\nKaty continues, “Eliminating these perpetual parts of our vows is the first step, but it’s really about choosing to focus more energy and attention on making our relationship good for as long as possible — than making statements where we promise our soul forever and then hope for the best. It modern and realistic.”\nWe use the terms like “life is too short” to live in the moment and make positive decisions, so why can’t we do the same with marriage too?\nIs it time we got real about love?

    "text": "MUMBAI: Cash logistics and ATM network managers of the country have been given a mandate to recalibrate rural ATMs on a priority basis by the government and the Reserve Bank of India . \n\nAs withdrawal of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes from circulation hit the Indian consumers hard, the section of the country to be affected the most is those residing in rural areas. \n\nWhile the government is pushing banks to help rural people open more accounts and transact digitally, the urgent need now is to recalibrate ATMs in rural and far off areas to ease the cash crunch. \n\n\"Till now we were concentrating on the urban and semi urban areas, recalibrating ATMs on the go, but now the target is to recalibrate as many rural ATMs as we can in order to ease the pressure of cash in the rural areas on a priority basis,\" said one of the bankers who is tracking the ATM recalibration in the country. \n\nBankers said that till now the rate at which ATMs were getting replenished was almost 12,000 per day, however that speed is bound to go down now as far off areas are targeted. \n\n\"In rural areas ATMs are far and fewer in between unlike in urban areas where they are usually found in clusters. It will take us more time to reach such ATMs in far flung areas,\" said the bankers mentioned above. \n\nWhile in the urban areas, a lot of ATMs have already been recalibrated, people were still facing empty machines or the ones dispensing only Rs 2,000 notes which people were avoiding. \n\nBankers said that the lack of Rs 500 notes in the country is causing banks to give only high value notes for which getting change for common people is becoming extremely difficult. \n\n\"Further, there is a huge pressure on the ATM network of the country as there is general lack of cash in the system. ATMs are getting empty faster than usual, we are replenishing them twice a day in some areas,\" said on banker. \n\n\"It could take us at least seven more days to stabilise the situation.\" Post the scrapping of the old notes, the biggest hurdle that the government faced was to get the ATM network up and running and dispense the new series notes on a priority basis",

    "text": "Privacy Policy Ideology permeated Soviet sport, including chess. One story I wrote for The Times from Moscow, in June 1981 , was about Boris Gulko, a Soviet champion who was excluded from major tournaments after he applied to emigrate to Israel. Allowed to compete in the Moscow open championship that June, he won, and then brought a hushed pall over the awards ceremony when he urged the Soviet Chess Federation to facilitate the emigration of the wife and son of Viktor Korchnoi, a Soviet grandmaster who had defected to the West. Korchnoi twice challenged the Soviet champion Anatoly Karpov, a Kremlin loyalist who assumed the title after Fischer failed to defend it. Their matches are memorable largely for bizarre controversies, which ranged from demands that chairs be X-rayed to complaints of hypnotism and secret codes. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Karpov next ran into a Jewish Armenian challenger named Garry Kasparov, at 21 an aggressive player who had stormed through the ranks of Russian grandmasters. Both were Soviet players, so it was not quite an East-West sequel, but Karpov was the standard-bearer of the Soviet establishment, and Kasparov became the favorite of dissidents and the West as they slugged through a marathon series of matches, the first of which went to 48 games. I covered that match for The Times in Moscow, and the tension was palpable in the hushed excitement that would sweep the crowd whenever Kasparov made a bold move and the K.G.B. types scattered through the audience to see who applauded. The current contest between Carlsen and Karjakin in New York doesn’t have the same political intrigue, though the president of the International Chess Federation, a Russian businessman named Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, has been banned from entering the United States because of alleged dealings with the Assad regime in Syria. And Karjakin, the youngest player ever to earn the title of grandmaster, did switch from Ukrainian to Russian citizenship in 2009. The focus this time is largely on the chess, which is probably as it should be. But it won’t be as memorable as when the kings, queens and their retinues stood on opposite sides of an ideological divide. \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .

[it's] a nice reward for that daily grind.\" Photo: A Cathy Wilcox cartoon lampooning Labor's 'mediscare' campaign. (Supplied: MOAD) \nAlan Moir, Chris 'Roy' Taylor, Chris Downes, David Rowe, David Pope, First Dog on the Moon and John Kudelka are just some of the other cartoonists with work featured in the exhibition \nMs Wilcox said the past 12 months in politics, both in Australia and abroad, had provided a wealth of material for her and her colleagues. \nBut in some ways, she said, it made the job harder. \n\"It's been a really intense thinking year for me, to try and work through some of these issues, and try to distil them down,\" she said. \n\"We're already talking about being a post-satire world a year ago … but what we've just witnessed with the American election, and all that's going on — and who knows what's coming after that. \n\"We're post-post-satire.\" 'Political destiny' an exhibition theme \nExhibition curator Tania Cleary said there were many cartoons considered by the judging panel — but this year's exhibition really zoned in on two major issues. \n\"They look at the Federal election and they look at the theme of political destiny,\" she said. \n\"So that takes into account what's happened in Europe, what's happened in Britain, what's happened in America.\"",

Salman Khan urges all his fans to watch SRK's Dear Zindagi \n\"Shah Rukh is always experimental with his role as an actor. He is the same actor who did a film like 'Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa', 'Asoka', 'Chak De! India' and 'Swades' and other so-called commercially successful films,\" Farah said. \n\n\"I think media and critics are acknowledging this more these days than earlier and they praise a star when they do such experimental roles in films,\" added Farah, who has worked with SRK in hit massy films like 'Main Hoon Na', 'Om Shanti Om' and 'Happy New year'. \n\nIs she interested in making a content-driven film? She said, \"What makes you think that a successful mainstream film does not have content? It is a wrong perception. I would say that all my films have more content than a 'content-driven film'. It is not easy to make such films. I would never want to do a content-driven film with a box office life of Rs 20 crore.\" \n\nHowever, Farah agreed that sometimes in a Shah Rukh or Amitabh Bachchan-starring film, audiences tend to focus on the star rather than the story and perhaps that is how the differentiation happened. \n\nI am not trying to change my image, says SRK 00:27 \nTOIFA 2016 : Technical Awards 1 80 TOIFA 2016 : Technical Awards Parineeti Chopra looks stunning in a gown during the TOIFA Technical Awards 2016 held at Jumeirah Beach Hotel in Dubai on March 17, 2016.

Tonight marks Nicky Butt's first foray into reserve team management - 24 years to the day since he made his United debut. \nGortonite Butt has coached before at Leigh Sports Village. Like Joyce, he could be heard from nearby Wigan when he managed the Under-19s there in their Uefa Youth League matches last season and against PSV Eindhoven crutches could not halt Butt from emerging into the technical area. \nUnited's second string are fifth in the table with just three wins and four draws - but only two defeats. The exodus of strikers and Jose Mourinho's decision to sanction loans has deprived the Reserves of attacking flair but their pragmatism is a useful learning curve if they are to break into Mourinho's side. \nLive updates will commence shortly.

    "text": "Jamaica Jamaica police commit 'hundreds of unlawful killings' yearly, Amnesty says \nEvidence gathered by human rights activists suggests state authorities order or are complicit in deaths amid ‘shocking culture of fear and violence’ Mario Deane died after being beaten in a police lockup. Photograph: Handout   15.11 GMT Last modified on   15.33 GMT View more   \nPolice officers in Jamaica carry out unlawful killings on the orders of state authorities or with their complicity, evidence gathered by Amnesty International suggests. \nResearch by the human rights organisation points to a strong likelihood that state-sponsored executions take place in the country, a report published on Wednesday said. \nAmnesty welcomed recent reductions in the numbers of civilians killed by police in Jamaica, but said that officers perpetuated a culture of fear in which evidence was tampered with, witnesses were terrorised and intimidated and weapons were planted on victims of police killings . \n“Jamaica’s shocking culture of fear and violence is allowing police officers to get away with hundreds of unlawful killings every year. Shocking injustice is the norm,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. \n“Unlawful killings of young men and terrorizing their relatives into silence seems to be the alternative to proper investigations into crimes. Over the last two decades, Jamaica’s ‘fight violence with violence’ approach to crime is not only short-sighted but has proven utterly ineffective in tackling the root causes of violence.” \nThe report Waiting in Vain: Unlawful Police Killings and Relatives’ Long Struggle for Justice said: “Information gathered … points to a strong likelihood of the existence of individual police officers or even units tasked with carrying out extrajudicial executions on the orders of some governmental authorities or with its complicity or acquiescence.” \nSince 2000, members of the Jamaican constabulary force (JCF) have allegedly killed 3,000 people, according to figures from Amnesty and Indecom , the police watchdog body. Jamaica's police at last being called to account for killings of civilians Read more \nPolice killings have been decreasing in frequency since Indecom began its work in 2010. Last year, 101 people were allegedly killed by officers, compared to 210 in in 2011 and 258 in 2013. \nBut Amnesty said there had been limited progress in addressing police impunity, lack of accountability and policing methods that fall far short of international standards. Three out of every five people shot by police died from their injuries. Between January and October 2016, 92 people were killed by law enforcement officials – an average of two killings by police a week. \nThe report said longstanding practices of tampering with evidence, leaving victims to “bleed out” and the use of unlawful killings as an alternative to arrest and lengthy criminal proceedings continued. \nThe mother of Mario Deane, who died after a severe beating in a police lockup, told researchers she could barely recognize her son’s swollen and disfigured face when she was initially told by police that he had “fallen off his bunk”, the report said. \nThe brother of another victim, Nakiea Jackson, witnessed police dragging his limp body by its feet to a police vehicle, throwing it in the back, and driving off. In other cases, family members were witnesses to direct threats by police officers to their relatives, who were later killed by police. People protest against the police killing of Akieem Stewart in Cheshire Village, Kingston, Jamaica, in 2015. Photograph: Collect for the Guardian \nEvidence suggests single police officers were often responsible for multiple killings. According to Indecom, in one case a single police officer has been implicated in 22 separate police shootings. \nIn 2013, the watchdog charged 13 officers operating out of the Clarendon division with murder after receiving information, from a former police informant and other witnesses, that police officers in Clarendon were selected by senior police officers for the specific objective of murdering people. It is alleged that the officers killed 60 people over a number of years. They have yet to come to trial. \nThe work of Indecom is cited by some as a reason for the reduction in police killings, but Amnesty said the watchdog was constantly being challenged by the police and other state bodies and a special criminal court set up to conduct inquests into alleged police killings was chronically underfunded. By 2013, the special coroner’s court had a backlog of 300 cases. \nThe police watchdog has charged nearly 100 officers with offences, but chronic delays meant only eight cases had been completed and one murder conviction secured. \nAmnesty International interviewed more than 50 relatives of 28 people believed to have been unlawfully killed by the police between 2003 and 2014. The report said: “Most had experienced intense and pervasive harassment and intimidation by police in their pursuit of justice, causing them further mental suffering. In some of the cases documented for this report, police treatment of victims’ families constitutes cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment.” \nAmnesty made a series of recommendations, including calling for: the Jamaican parliament to condemn extrajudicial and unlawful killings by police, an increase in Indecom’s budget, Jamaica to sign the international Convention Against Torture, police reform and for the immediate removal of all officers and units involved in fatal shootings to assess their future suitability for deployment. \n“If authorities in Jamaica are serious about tackling the country’s shocking levels of police killings and violence, they must urgently promote a deep police and justice reform to address not only the number of police murders but the root causes of the problem,” said Guevara-Rosas. \nMany relatives of the dead told researchers police stigmatized their communities for being poor. \nAmnesty said witnesses repeatedly told them: “They have no respect,” “They kick off doors, without a warrant,” “If you try and answer them back they try and brutalize you and accuse you of attacking the police,” “The government gives them power to kill we.” \nOne woman said: “Some of dem come in their uniform. But when they come to kill yuh pickney [your child], they take off their badge… and they come in a mask ... ”",

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump threatened on Monday to end President Obama’s push to forge diplomatic relations and relax sanctions against Cuba, suggesting that he might wipe away two years of executive action to strengthen ties if he cannot reach “a better deal” for both Cuba and the United States. In a post on Twitter that came three days after the death of Fidel Castro , the father of Cuba’s revolution and embodiment of a half-century of suspicion and hostility between the United States and Cuba, Mr. Trump gave no details about what kind of changes he would seek in Mr. Obama’s policy. But the comment hinted that the president-elect, who has been critical of the shift toward greater engagement between Americans and Cubans, is considering reinstating restrictions on commerce, trade and financial transactions that Mr. Obama has stripped away since he announced two years ago that he and President Raúl Castro had agreed to normalize relations. He has already installed Maurico Claver-Carone, a Cuban-American who has been a harsh critic of Mr. Obama’s opening, on his transition team for the Treasury Department, which has issued several rounds of regulations to remove impediments for United States companies and individuals seeking to do business with Cuba and travel there. If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 28, 2016 Mr. Trump’s advisers were vague about what his approach would be on Cuba, telling reporters in a conference call that Mr. Trump would address the issue when he assumed office. “To be clear, the president-elect wants to see freedom in Cuba for Cubans,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman.",

    "text": "Editorial: Trump’s not-so-blind trust fails ethical standards \nThe 1,200-mile pipeline would carry oil across four states to a shipping point in Illinois. The project has been held up while the Army Corps of Engineers consults with the Standing Rock Sioux, who believe the project could harm the tribe’s drinking water and Native American cultural sites. \nThe delay, which comes as protests unfold daily along the proposed route, raises the likelihood that a final decision will be made by Trump, a pipeline supporter who has vowed to ‘‘unleash’’ unfettered production of oil and gas. He takes office in January. Advertisement \n‘‘Trump’s investments in the pipeline business threaten to undercut faith in this process — which was already frayed — by interjecting his own financial well-being into a much bigger decision,’’ said Sharon Buccino, director of the land and wildlife program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. \n‘‘This should be about the interests of the many, rather than giving the appearance of looking at the interests of a few — including Trump,’’ Buccino said. \nTrump, a billionaire who has never held public office, holds ownership stakes in more than 500 companies worldwide. He has said he plans to transfer control of his company to three of his adult children, but ethics experts have said conflicts could engulf the new administration if Trump does not liquidate his business holdings. \nRep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., senior Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Trump’s investment in the pipeline company ‘‘disturbing’’ and said it fits a pattern evident in Trump’s transition team. \n‘‘You have climate (change) deniers, industry lobbyists and energy conglomerates involved in that process,’’ Grijalva said. ‘‘The pipeline companies are gleeful. This is pay-to-play at its rawest.’’ \nBesides Trump, at least two possible candidates for energy secretary also could benefit from the pipeline. Oil billionaire Harold Hamm could ship oil from his company, Continental Resources, through the pipeline, while former Texas Gov. Rick Perry serves on the board of directors of Energy Transfer Partners. \nConcern about Trump’s possible conflicts comes as protests over the pipeline have intensified in recent weeks, with total arrests since August rising to 528. A clash this past week near the main protest camp in North Dakota left a police officer and several protesters injured. \nNorth Dakota Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple, along with GOP Sen. John Hoeven and Rep. Kevin Cramer, called on President Barack Obama to authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to approve the pipeline crossing, the last large segment of the nearly completed pipeline. \nKelcy Warren, CEO of Dallas-based Energy Transfer, told The Associated Press that he expects Trump to make it easier for his company and others to complete infrastructure projects. \n‘‘Do I think it’s going to get easier? Of course,’’ said Warren, who donated $3,000 to Trump’s campaign, plus $100,000 to a committee supporting Trump’s candidacy and $66,800 to the Republican National Committee. \n‘‘If you’re in the infrastructure business,’’ he said, ‘‘you need consistency. That’s where this process has gotten off track.’’ \nThe Army Corps of Engineers granted Warren’s company the permits needed for the crossing in July, but the agency decided in September that further analysis was warranted, given the tribe’s concerns. On Nov. 14, the corps called for even more study. \nThe company has asked a federal judge to declare it has the right to lay pipe under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota. The judge isn’t likely to issue a decision until January at the earliest. Related ",

GETTY Today is the UN's international day for the elimination of violence to women and girls \nThe Ministry for Families, Seniors, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) will now provide money for the scheme which aims to give better protection to the vulnerable, including the remodelling of migrant centres to give more privacy to females and minors. \nPolice have for long told of a rising trend of abuse, including rapes, but in the highly-charged political atmosphere that surrounds the whole refugee issue in Germany the problem has largely remained unaddressed. \nMunicipal authorities will be able to get the money from central government in the form of in zero-interest loans. GETTY Angela Merkel's government pledged over £160 million to tackle sexual abuse against German refugees \n\"Unfortunately we know that children and women in the camps are not safe from abuse and sexual assault. That's why we have to make sure that they're protected,\" said junior minister Ralf Kleindiek. \n\"Not only measures regarding staff, but also structural measures have to be implemented such as lockable accommodation units and separate sanitary facilities. \n\"For the children and adolescents we also need designated rooms to enable play and learning.\" \nFuelling the rise in sexual assaults is alcohol. \nMany Muslim men are exposed to alcoholic drinks for the first time in their lives, leading to booze binges that end in mayhem. GOOGLE MAPS In and around Stuttgart alone there were 105 rapes, assaults and robberies on women \nA clampdown on this has started with a ban on all alcohol being brought into any migrant shelter anywhere in the country. \nPart of the scheme to clamp down on sex abuse involves working with experts from Unicef to train staff in how to deal with the problem at more than 100 centres. \nAround £3 million of the total amount available will be spent on constructing specialist centres to provide counselling for survivors of rape and torture. \nThe government has also formed a working group in a bid to solve the problem of child marriages. \nHundreds, if not thousands, of those who streamed into Germany in the past 18 months have child brides. \nThese unions were legal in their homelands but not in Germany where - with some court mandated exceptions - the legal marrying age is 18.

    "text": "Bluefields (Nicaragua) (AFP) - Central America suffered a hurricane and offshore earthquake at the same time, triggering alarm in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica but no immediate reports of any casualties. Nicaragua was caught in the middle of both events, with Hurricane Otto, a storm packing sustained winds of up to 175 kilometers (110 miles) per hour at the time, plowing into its Caribbean coast while the 7.0 quake occurred in the Pacific Ocean, off its other coast.\nNicaraguan President Daniel Ortega declared a national emergency to handle both potential disasters.\nBut hours later, there were no reports of any widespread destruction, only of fallen trees and electrical cables, and a few collapsed roofs from the storm.\nEl Salvador ordered residents along its Pacific shore to move inland. But it and Nicaragua soon lifted tsunami alerts they had issued as a precaution.\nBy nightfall, Otto was \"weakening rapidly over southern Nicaragua,\" the US-based National Hurricane Center said in a 0000 GMT bulletin.\nThe Miami-based NHC said Otto's maximum sustained winds had slowed to 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour in Nicaragua.\nIn Panama, eight people lost their lives during the storm in recent days, three of them directly linked, Jose Donderis, director of the national civil protection service, said Thursday at a news conference.\nThe other five people died through acts of negligence or risky behavior, such as not following authorities' warnings, he said.\nOtto's projected path was through sparsely inhabited rural areas in southern Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica. It was expected to weaken to a tropical storm late Thursday before exiting into the Pacific.\nSatellite images showed Bluefields, Nicaragua's main Caribbean city, bearing the brunt of the hurricane, but there was almost no wind or rain.\nAn AFP journalist there said there was even some sunshine.\n\"We haven't lost any lives. Things are going well. We think that tonight (Thursday), people should be able to start going back to their homes,\" said a government representative in Bluefields, Lumberto Campbell.\n- High vigilance -\nIn San Juan de Nicaragua further south, the town closest to where Otto made landfall, there were reports of strong wind and rain, with fallen trees and electrical cables, and roofs torn off -- but no deaths or injuries.\nNeighboring Costa Rica, which had been fearing its first direct hit from a hurricane since records began in 1851, also showed little damage.\nThe government had declared a national emergency, closed schools, sent non-essential workers home for Thursday and Friday, and evacuated around 4,000 people from its Caribbean coast.\nVigilance remained high in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, however, given the risk of mudslides in coming days from the storm's rains.\nIn El Salvador, following the quake, officials scrambled to evaluate the possible damage. The task was made more difficult because some telephone lines in the capital San Salvador had been cut.",

    "text": "Thatcher 'resisted' chancellor's new kitchen plea 25 November 2016 Close share panel Image copyright PA Margaret Thatcher was reluctant to allow her first Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe to spend £4,150 on a new kitchen, newly-released papers show. \nThe papers from 1979 show Edna Healey, wife of Sir Geoffrey's predecessor, warned of the \"antediluvian\" room at Number 11 Downing Street. \nThree calls were made to \"nag\" Mrs Thatcher to approve the refurbishment. \nReplies from a private secretary suggest the PM may have been reluctant to become involved amid spending cuts. \nThe exchanges are revealed in the late chancellor's secret papers in the National Archives from 1979-1983. \nThey show his predecessor Denis Healey was the first person to contact Sir Geoffrey after he was appointed after the Conservative landslide general election win. \nBut the new chancellor was said to be even more surprised to hear Mr Healey was passing on a message from his wife, Edna, to Sir Geoffrey's wife, Elspeth, warning her not to move into the flat at Number 11 unless the kitchen was updated. 'Chancellor's discretion' \nAn estimate for the work was submitted but it took three calls by Treasury officials over a three month period to elicit a reply from Mrs Thatcher's staff. \nIn his reply, one of Mrs Thatcher's private secretaries, Colin Paterson, wrote: \"I am very sorry that this has been so long outstanding. I was under the impression that the prime minister had had a word with the chancellor. \n\"If not, I am sure that she would wish to leave this to the chancellor's discretion, keeping in mind how sensitive expenditure of this kind can be.\" \nAnother document in the National Archives outlines radical plans to end universal free healthcare. \nThe document stamped \"secret\" was called, in keeping with films and books of that era, \"The Omega Project\". \nCivil servants noted that \"for the majority it would represent the abolition of the NHS\". \nBut in spite of what was described as the nearest thing to a Cabinet riot in the history of the Thatcher administration, the prime minister secretly pressed ahead with the plans - before later backing down.

    "text": "8 Foods You Must Eat When You’re in Portugal By Erika Owen \nT+L Just In newsletter. T+L Newsletters \nIf you're in to food, and trying all different kinds of things, Portugal needs to be next on your trip list. \nWhile they hold tight to their traditional recipes—you can try cod a thousand different ways around the entire country—the locals sure know how to surprise taste buds with ingredients that have been used for ages. \nOn a recent trip to Portugal, we met up with André of Taste Porto Food Tours , which turned out to be one of the best decisions of the trip. Not only did he know of all of the best restaurants that someone spending two days in the area would never know about, but he had stories and history lessons to share on every step of the tour. And, of course, he knew where the very best food could be found. \nThe tour itself took up an entire night—and it was 100 percent worth it. Here are many of the things we tried on the tour, plus a few other must-try dishes discovered during the rest of my trip. \nJust consider this another reason to visit the 2016 Destination of the Year . Pastèis de Nata \nThis bite-sized custard tart (pictured above) is known around the world as one of the best foods to come out of Portugal. While there are bakeries in many more countries than just Portugal offering this sweet treat, the tarts originated in the 19th century from a group of monks living in Belém. \nThey sold the pastries from a small general store attached to the property's sugar cane refinery as a way to survive the convents and monasteries being shut down during the liberal revolution in 1834. \nYou can now find these pastries in any Portuguese bakery. Pastèis de Chaves Oporto Food Tours \nThese flaky pastries come with a variety of fillings: veal, chocolate, chicken, tomato, egg, cod. The best place to get them may just be in Porto at a little shop call Loja dos Pastéis de Chaves . \nThe pastries come from a northern city in Portugal called Chaves, and this bakery uses the original recipe. Terylene Sandwich Oporto Food Tours \nThis sandwich takes 24 hours to prepare. It has roasted pork loin and smoked ham—the former of which is cured for 20 hours with a mix of wine, tomatoes, rosemary, garlic, and chili peppers. After the meats are roasted for hours, they come together in a double bun, where the remaining juices melt right into the bread. \nPair this sandwich—which you can get at a restaurant on a semi-hidden alley street called Flor dos Congregados —with sparking red wine for a culinary match made in heaven. Coffee at Café Guarany Oporto Food Tours \nIf you're looking for quirky art, great espresso, and a fancy setting, head to Café Guarany . Here, they call a short espresso a “cimbalino,” in homage to the first espresso machines introduced to Portugal by a brand called La Cimbali. \nYou can find great espresso in every city in Portugal, and it's a common way to end a meal. Chocolate and Lemon Eclairs Oporto Food Tours \nIf you couldn't tell, chocolate and pastries are a favorite for the Portuguese. Hop and any review website and you'll find travelers pining for the eclairs from Leitaria da Quinta do Paço in Porto. \nWe made a stop to give the chocolate and lemon eclairs a try. Pro tip: Order extra cream to eat with the pastries—and there's no shame in eating it with a spoon. Cheese & Charcuterie Plates Erika Owen \nCheese and cured meats are always a good choice in Portugal. Each region has its own take on the plate, and you'll always get some bread and olives to go with your picks. Taberna do Largo —a restaurant in the TK neighborhood of Porto—is run by a brother and sister who travel the world to find the best meat, cheese, olives, and wine from smaller producers. \nDon't miss out on trying Portugal's storied vinho verde (“green wine”) while you're here. Sushi \nShana Novak \nPortugal's access to the Atlantic Ocean makes it a great spot for fresh sushi. But head to Sushi Design at Farol Design Hotel in Cascais and you'll find much more than your basic spicy tuna or salmon avocado rolls. \nSushi Master Nuande Pekel mixes ingredients and presentation in a way that will redefine your expectations of the Japanese staple for years to come. Our favorite: a Hosomaki roll with breaded salmon, cream cheese, strawberry and katsuobushi with tare sauce. Cecina de Vaca Maturada Erika Owen \nPortugal really knows how to do smoked and cured meats. Of the entire trip, a plate of cecina de vaca maturada (aged cow steak) was the most memorable—not only for its vivid color and presentation, but becuase each bite was melt-in-your-mouth good. \nIf you want to try it yourself, head to RIB BEEF & Wine Restaurant at the Pestana Vintage in Porto.

Anyone with evidence of or concerns about illegal practices at our stores are encouraged to come forward and we will promptly and thoroughly investigate. Our Franchisee Employee Helpline (1800 711 243) is a dedicated, external and independent service, available to all employees of 7-Eleven Franchisees, to raise issues and concerns in regard to misconduct, unethical and illegal activity within franchised 7-Eleven stores. \nOver the past year 7-Eleven has made a significant investment in industry-leading initiatives across our franchisee network, including a bio-metric time clock system and centralised payroll system, and a significant increase in field-level investigation and compliance activity, to ensure to ensure that all store team members receive the wages and conditions applicable under the relevant award. \nIn respect to the allegations raised today by the ABC, we were not previously aware of any concerns relating to this store, and no staff member has raised any issue with us. As soon as the allegations were raised with us by the ABC, we commenced an internal investigation. \nWe will be appalled if these allegations are proven. Our Franchisee network knows we take a zero tolerance approach to wage fraud. Our new measures are designed to ensure that team members are paid their appropriate wages in full. The alleged practice occurs after the correct wages have been paid, and is effectively extortion or theft in breach of the law, our Franchise Agreement, our policies and our values. \nWithout having seen the complete evidence behind the staff member’s allegation aired by the ABC, it is inappropriate for us to jump to a conclusion. However, we will aggressively investigate and, where required, act upon any allegations of illegal Franchisee activity, up to and including termination of the Franchise Agreement. We also encourage any staff disadvantaged by such activity to contact us directly and we will promptly pursue repayment of any monies owed to them by their employer.",

    "text": "\nKeith Bedford/Globe Staff\nOn Harvard’s campus last week, ralliers showed support for undocumented students.\nBy Laura Krantz Globe Staff November 22, 2016\nAt colleges in Massachusetts and across the country, students are demanding that the schools protect their undocumented immigrant classmates if the incoming administration of Donald Trump moves to deport them.\nIn a letter released Monday, more than 100 college and university presidents urged Trump and others to preserve and expand a four-year-old program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that protects undocumented immigrants. The presidents of Harvard, MIT, Boston University, Northeastern, and Smith, Mount Holyoke, and Amherst colleges were among the signatories.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘With DACA, our students and alumni have been able to pursue opportunities in business, education, high tech and the nonprofit sector; they have gone to medical school, law school and graduate schools in numerous disciplines,’’ the presidents said in the letter . ‘‘They are actively contributing to their local communities and economies.’’\nThe good news for undocumented students: Legal experts say it is highly unlikely the new president would dispatch federal agents to storm college dormitories and classrooms.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The bad news is that even if campuses declare themselves “sanctuaries’’ and vow not to cooperate with immigration officials, undocumented students still could face a threat if Trump follows through on his campaign pledge to rescind DACA.\nThat program, a 2012 executive order signed by President Obama, grants temporary relief to children brought here illegally and allows them to continue their studies and work. DACA protects 741,546 individuals nationwide, including 7,025 with addresses in Massachusetts, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services\nMost colleges do not require students to be citizens to attend and many do not ask domestic students about their immigration status on applications. Ivy League colleges, in particular, have encouraged undocumented students to apply and offered them scholarships since they are ineligible for federal loans.\nAdvertisement\nAfter Trump’s victory earlier this month and in response to student outcry, schools have convened teams of lawyers, professors, and administrators to weigh possibilities and legal strategies to shield students.\n“People are taking [Trump] at his word and so preparing for the worst,” said Roberto Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education who specializes in the education of immigrants and Latino students.\nEven as Brown University’s president signed the petition in support of DACA, she was realistic with students last week in an op-ed she wrote in the student newspaper after more than 600 students turned out for a rally.\n“While we wish we could offer absolute protection to members of our community who are threatened by possible changes in policy, it would be irresponsible to promise protections that we cannot legally deliver,” Brown’s president, Christina Paxson, wrote.\nStill, it remains improbable that the authorities would target college students, said a Department of Homeland Security official.\nIn 2010, undocumented Harvard student Eric Balderas was detained at a Texas airport, but officials with ICE ultimately decided not to deport him .\n“ICE is focused on the arrest of convicted criminals who pose a threat to public safety as well as recent border crosses,” said the official, who spoke on background. “Historically and currently, neither schools nor their students have been a focus of ICE operations.’’\n‘We have a moral responsibility to protect the safety and well-being of all students regardless of their citizenship status.’\nAnthony Monaco, Tufts University president ICE has not and does not conduct enforcement on campuses unless there is a serious and extraordinary circumstance involved, such as a threat to national security, the official added.\nMIT, Harvard, Boston University, Northeastern, Tufts, Yale, Dartmouth, Brown, and Middlebury College, in response to inquiries from the Globe, all said they are monitoring the incoming administration’s actions and want to protect their students.\nWesleyan University’s president, Michael S. Roth, took a strong position Sunday in a message on the college’s website, declaring that Wesleyan “will not voluntarily assist in any efforts by the federal government to deport our students, faculty, or staff solely because of their citizenship status.”\nEven before Trump was elected, some colleges were providing special resources for undocumented students.\nThe University of Connecticut in September added a tab on its admissions site specifically for undocumented students. In Connecticut, such students are eligible for in-state tuition.\nIn May, University of California’s president, Janet Napolitano, announced a three-year plan, her second such effort, to support undocumented students with additional services and more money for student loans. The system’s chancellor last week said it will not cooperate with law enforcement to deport students.\nTufts University in Medford convened a task force more than a year ago to weigh how to best meet the needs of undocumented students.\n“We have a moral responsibility to protect the safety and well-being of all students regardless of their citizenship status or personal identities,” Tufts president Anthony Monaco told students at a rally last week.\nHarvard students delivered a petition to the university’s president, Drew Faust, last week asking for more campus resources for undocumented students, including a dedicated staff member.\nHarvard has about 40 undocumented undergraduates and Brown has about 20, according to the schools. Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane said the college is “committed to supporting undocumented students.”\nElimination of DACA could have other wide-ranging consequences, said Susan Church, an immigration attorney in Boston, including making such students ineligible for certain types of financial aid and jobs. It would also cause a flurry of litigation on behalf of students, she said.\n“Politically it would be a disaster for [Trump] to start with this group of immigrants,” Church said.\nWhatever happens, this election is seared into the memory of many of those students, a stark reminder of their fragile status even on elite college campuses.\nHarvard freshman Rosa Vazquez said she couldn’t sleep on election night.\n“It was like the people that I had faith in, and this American dream that I loved with my whole heart and had pursued for so many years, telling me that I wasn’t worth it,” said Vazquez, who came to the United States from Mexico when she was 8 months old.\nAfter the election, Vazquez has focused her energy on advocating for Harvard’s undocumented students.\nBrown student Renata Mauriz, who came from Brazil when she was 12, helped organize the rally at the Providence school. Mauriz is unsure what it will mean to graduate undocumented into a world with Trump as president.\nThese days, though, her future seems less important than that of her mother, an undocumented worker in New Jersey who she says endures long hours and low pay because she wants her two children to have a chance.\n“For me, having that diploma, it’s my duty for her,” Mauriz said.\nLaura Krantz can be reached at laura.krantz@globe.com .

    "text": "4 COMMENTS What happens to the Democratic Party in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory?\nTo get insights, The Wall Street Journal’s Gerald F. Seib spoke with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Here are edited excerpts of their discussion.\nMR. SEIB: A couple of days after the election, you said, “If we learn nothing else from the past two years of electioneering, we should hear the message loud and clear that the American people want Washington to change. It was clear in the Democratic primaries. It was clear in the Republican primaries. It was clear in the campaign and it was clear on Election Day.” How do Democrats show that they heard that message?\nSEN. WARREN: The interesting question is going to be both halves. How are the Democrats going to show it, and how is Donald Trump going to show that he actually heard that message? That’s the message he ran on. What Donald Trump is doing is putting together a transition team that is full of lobbyists—the kind of people that he ran against. [Vice President-elect Mike Pence has since ordered the removal of all lobbyists from the transition team.]\nJournal Report Read more at WSJ.com/LeadershipReport More in CEO Council Rudolph Giuliani on Trump’s Immediate Agenda Kellyanne Conway: The Election Was All About Security Fed Governor Tarullo Talks Interest Rates What Global Disease Threat Worries Public-Health Officials Most? Preet Bharara on Keeping Corporate Executives Honest The clearest point that comes out of this election is that the American people do not want Wall Street to run their government. They do not want corporate executives to be the ones who are calling the shots in Washington.\nLook at the polling from this, that about three-quarters of all Americans do believe that the game is rigged. They believe it is rigged in favor of the people in this room and that it is rigged against them and their families and their children. And they want to see change.\nThey want to see that connection between Wall Street and giant corporations and our government broken. They want that not to happen anymore. They want a government that runs for the people. That’s what I think this election is about.\nMR. SEIB: So how do the two parties show that? What do Democrats do? What does the Trump team do that it’s not doing now in your opinion?\nSEN. WARREN: Well, it doesn’t start by hiring a bunch of lobbyists to run the transition. It doesn’t start by floating names of people who’ve run giant hedge funds, or been part of that, to be able to run the Treasury. Or people who come from industry to be able to run the regulatory agencies.\nThe American people understand about the revolving door. They’re really sick of it.\nHe did not win on Mitch McConnell,Paul Ryan, business as usual, what can we do to help the giant corporations in America.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren discusses what the 2016 election indicates about what Americans want from government. Photo: Paul Morse The K Street lobbyists are absolutely out there, salivating. They say, “This is our big chance. We’re going to get to slash regulations. Look for a tax cut for those at the top.” That is not what the people who elected Donald Trump are thinking.\nMR. SEIB: Is there a place where populists in the Democratic Party and a Trump administration could come together?\nSEN. WARREN: This just keeps going back to, what is Donald Trump going to do? He’s now given us the first tangible sign of his vision of how to run a Trump presidency. And a big part of that are lobbyists and Washington insiders.\nAnd let’s face it. There was a lot during the election of the toxic stew of bigotry and attacks on Americans all across this country. Donald Trump started his campaign with an attack on Mexican-Americans and then he rode the escalator down. He did attacks on women, on African-Americans, on Muslims, on immigrants. He did attacks on people with disabilities. Everybody who didn’t look like the people who showed up at his rallies.\nThere were a lot of people who were attracted to that. But there were a lot of people who were not and yet voted for Donald Trump. They said, “We want somebody who’s going to shake it up.”\nHere I am with the business leaders of America, and I just want to underline something that every one of you know. Bigotry is bad for business.\nBigotry is not what your employees expect. Bigotry is not what your customers expect. And if that’s the direction that this administration goes, that creates a real problem for everybody.\nThe change in sides MR. SEIB: But as you suggest, there are millions of people who voted for Donald Trump not for those reasons. Most of those people used to be Democrats. How did your party lose them? Why were they Trump voters?\nSEN. WARREN: I think that Donald Trump made the promise to shake things up. He made the argument over and over and over that the Democrats were too close to Wall Street and too close to big business. That was the core of his economic argument, that too many insiders were calling the shots. That too many multinational corporations were running the trade deals. That too many people who’d already made it big were using the tools of government to work for themselves and not to work for anyone else.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren discusses the signals Donald Trump is sending about his presidency. Photo: Paul Morse I want to be clear. I think Hillary Clinton ran on very much the same argument, I just think Donald Trump made it aggressively. But the point is, you can’t miss this about the election. Whether they drove it effectively or whether they drove it less effectively, it was driving the message that Washington needs to work for the little guy. That Washington needs to work for the families who’ve been left behind. That Washington doesn’t need to work for those at the top anymore. And this is so important going forward because it raises this question about what does the economic agenda look like.\nSetting the agenda MR. SEIB: Well, let’s talk about that. What should the economic agenda look like, in your opinion?\nSEN. WARREN: I think there’s no mandate out there for Mitch McConnell and for Paul Ryan. I think there is no mandate right now to cut regulations and say, “I know, let’s just turn a bunch of Wall Street banks loose and see what they will do. Let’s not remember what happened in 2008 and the run-up to 2008.” I think the appetite for that among the American people is zero.\nWhether people were voting for Hillary Clinton or whether they were voting for Donald Trump, they weren’t voting for Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan’s deregulatory mix—let guys do whatever they want to do, let giant corporations do whatever they want to do.\nWrite to reports@wsj.com",

    "text": "Advice on manners and morals. Nov. 22 2016 9:08 AM I Before We Prudie advises a letter writer whose sister’s refusal to spell correctly is having deleterious family effects. Mallory Ortberg Sam Breach \nMallory Ortberg, aka Dear Prudence, is online weekly to chat live with readers. An edited transcript of the chat is below. (Sign up below to get Dear Prudence delivered to your inbox each week. Read Prudie’s Slate columns here . Send questions to Prudence at .) \nReaders! Ask me your questions on the voicemail of the Dear Prudence podcast. Just leave a message at 401-371-DEAR (3327), and you may hear your question answered on a future episode of the show. stu99/Thinkstock Advertisement \nQ. Arrogant aunt: My sister taught my son an incorrect spelling of a word. She said that it was always spelled that way until recently, and that it was only changed because people were too dumb to spell it right. I found evidence to the contrary, but that didn’t seem to faze her. (The word is dilemma , which she insists is actually spelled dilemNa .) I don’t want my son spelling words wrong, but more importantly I don’t want him to pick up his aunt’s attitude that “I’m right, and everyone who says otherwise is wrong,” which unfortunately he seems to be doing. Do I need to keep him away from her? \nA: Your sister is stone-cold wrong; the word dilemma has never been spelled with an “n.” It’s a Berenstain Bears -style Mandela Effect . However, I think you should probably limit the number of family estrangements you initiate over linguistic prescriptivism, even as unpleasant as prescriptivism tends to be. Consider this an opportunity to teach your son about analyzing other people’s worldviews and making decisions for himself—is there truly something morally superior in spelling a word with an “n” versus an “m”? Or is his aunt simply attempting to assert some sense of order and authority due to her own inability to deal with ambiguity? Subscribe to Prudie! \nJust because your sister seems to have a hard time letting things go, coupled with a need to be right 100 percent of the time, doesn’t mean you should try to match her. Tell your son that sometimes reasonable people disagree, and even if you think she’s incorrect, it doesn’t mean you have to cut off contact or “prove” to her that she’s wrong. Show your son a gentler, less-controlling way of seeing the world, and I think he’ll find it more attractive than your sister’s—no need to “keep him away” from her way of seeing things if you can provide a superior alternative. \nQ. How to retreat from the company retreat?: I work for a small company (12 people in our office) that is pretty tight-knit. Of my co-workers, there are three women in their early-to-mid 20s (myself included in this group) and the rest of the office is comprised of men aged 40 to 60. An interesting office dynamic, but we all mostly get along well. However, I feel boundaries are being pushed after I recently found out about an upcoming company retreat where all of us are expected to spend the night at my boss’s vacation house about two hours away from the city we work in. We’ve been told that a big focus of the trip will be “team bonding” with mention of drinking games. I was also told to bring my swimsuit because there will be a hot tub. Am I off-base, or is this inappropriate for a company event? If we were staying in a resort where we each got our own room, that would be one thing, but staying in one house and presumably sharing rooms makes me uncomfortable, as does the prospect of drinking with co-workers being a focus. The age/gender disparity of the office makes the situation more uncomfortable, and I would feel that my professional relationship with my co-workers, particularly the older men, could be compromised if I have to see them in swimsuits and share bathrooms. Seems like a recipe for a disaster, or at least a lot of awkwardness, and neither I nor my husband are totally comfortable with it. However, as it goes with small companies, it will be painfully obvious if I don’t go and I’ll need to come up with an excuse. I feel that I’m being put in a position to either go and be uncomfortable or not go and reap some degree of professional consequences for not being a “team player.” We are small enough to not have a formal HR department. What should I do here? Advertisement \nA: This may differ from office to office and person to person, but the idea of having to participate in drinking games and a hot tub session with any of the people I’ve ever worked with makes me want to break out into hives, so I don’t think you’re alone in finding this off-putting. If you’re close with your boss, you might consider bringing up your concerns with him—“I’m looking forward to the retreat, but I don’t feel comfortable at the idea of spending time in a hot tub with the people I work with every day, especially since I’ve been told ‘drinking games’ will be part of the schedule, and I don’t want others to feel uncomfortable either. Is there any way we can focus on other team-building activities that don’t require us to share a hot tub? If anyone wants to use it after-hours, of course, I don’t mind, but I’m uncomfortable at the prospect of having that on the list of official activities.” \nIf you don’t think your boss would handle that feedback well, then I think you should plan ahead to minimize your own discomfort (without drawing attention to yourself if you’re afraid you’ll be treated differently for not participating). If you don’t want to drink or get in a hot tub with your co-workers (a perfectly reasonable stance!), come up with a script ahead of time for graceful non-participation: Thanks, I’m not drinking today; I’m coming down with a cold so I won’t join you in the hot tub, etc. It’s unfortunate that you have to come up with any reason other than “I don’t want to take shots and get in a hot tub with my co-workers,” but you do what you have to. \nQ. Election trouble: I’m a liberal black woman who has been in a relationship with a conservative white man for over a year. The day after the election, I cried all day and was unable to dress myself or leave my apartment. Because of Trump’s racist rhetoric, I’m scared for the safety of people of color in particular—and I’m hurt that millions of voters decided that racism wasn’t a dealbreaker. Right before going to visit his mother, my boyfriend told me that his mother, father, and stepmother all voted for Trump. During the visit, I was so hurt and angry I could barely speak to her, especially when she called the protests “stupid.” \nGiven this background, I don’t want to attend Thanksgiving with his father and stepmother this year as is expected. Is it rude of me to bow out? I don’t feel comfortable enough with them to fight them on politics. Advertisement \nA: There are matters of political difference where I think it is important to look for compromise and common ground. This is not one of them. (Peaceful protests, by the way, are an essential component of democratic life; they may not be the only, or even the best, means of disseminating information and inciting change, but that does not mean they are not worthwhile.) It is not rude of you to spend Thanksgiving with your own family and friends, or even just by yourself, this year. It would not be rude of you to reconsider your relationship with this man, if you feel that he is not as concerned for your safety and well-being as he is for his family’s comfort. Take care of yourself. \n(For readers of this column in general: It is always OK to spend the holidays by yourself, if the prospect of fighting with your in-laws or family members seems both inevitable and impossible. There are worse things in the world than missing a single Thanksgiving or Christmas to stay at home with a good book or a good friend. “The holidays” can take on a mystical, sacred cast for some people, as if missing them once in awhile were some unforgivable violation of the social compact. They’re not. They’re just holidays. Give yourself permission to bow out, if things are looking dire.) \nQ. Friends or fetishes: Every few days I see an older white gentleman at my gym who is always accompanied by a much younger (I assume college-aged) guy of a particular ethnicity. It’s a different person each time but they’re all of the same ethnic background, and sometimes there are two guys with him. Whenever their conversation is within earshot it’s clear to me that the younger party is not very proficient in English. I assume whatever going on—if anything beyond mere companionship—is between consenting adults and is none of my business, but it does feel weird to me, particularly with the lack of English proficiency and the significant age gap. Am I wrong to take note of this man and his rotating selection of younger men? I can’t help but be a little creeped out. \nA: His behavior does not seem to merit comments from strangers. If you two were friends, and you wanted to have a conversation about fetishism, it might be an excellent opportunity to discuss the intersections of desire and tokenism and respect, but you don’t know him at all, and you haven’t heard him say anything inappropriate or disrespectful. I don’t think you should say anything to him. Advertisement \nQ. Re: How to retreat from the company retreat?: Mallory, you missed the point of this letter. She doesn’t want to go at all. So telling her to say she is looking forward to it isn’t going to help her at all. \nA: I understand not wanting to go, but I don’t want to encourage her to do something that might jeopardize her position—this may not be an optional company retreat. If she thinks she can get out of it without running into pushback, I think she should, but it may be a mandatory exercise, and if that’s the case, I want her to have some effective strategies for minimizing her discomfort. It doesn’t sound like the atmosphere at work is generally troubling, so I’m reluctant to encourage her to look for a new one on the strength of a single uncomfortable-sounding retreat (although if this company has a habit of encouraging hot-tub-centered team-building exercises, I’d certainly advise her to start applying elsewhere). \nQ. Re: How to retreat from the company retreat?: I think the LW should find a good excuse for not attending—something family-related with her husband. It’s not just the hot tub and drinking games she mentioned; it’s sharing rooms and bathrooms. This is totally inappropriate and a recipe for disaster. Even without the LW saying it, it was clear they DON’T have that HR department or I think this whole idea would have been nixed in the first place. \nA: Absolutely. I think my advice should be arranged in three tiers: The best option would be telling her boss she thinks it’s a bad idea to share bathrooms/living spaces, drink with her colleagues while staying in the same house, and share a hot tub, and that she’s not going to attend. The next best would be coming up with a plausible excuse for not going. If that’s not possible, and her boss is insisting on attendance, I think she should have a strategy in place for minimizing uncomfortable interactions. If this seems like an unusual exception to her work dynamic that results more from cluelessness than from a desire to manipulate younger female colleagues, there might be an opportunity to help her boss create a more welcoming work environment; if it’s in keeping with a general power imbalance between the older men and the younger women at work, she might want to push back and/or look for a job somewhere else. Advertisement \nQ. No longer cares about marriage: My girlfriend of 4.5 years broke up with me rather suddenly in July. I wanted to get married, she didn’t feel ready and said she felt pressured. (If it helps, we are both in our 40s and divorced.) I’m having trouble getting over it though I’m exercising, seeing friends, etc. We still text each other nearly daily and have occasionally met up as friends. I felt worse in the period where we were not talking right after the breakup. I find myself wanting to re-establish a romantic relationship. I would rather be with her and not married than without her. I don’t think she is open to it because our breakup was a very mean fight so I’m not sure if it makes sense to bring it up. What should I do? \nA: I think you should stop texting her. It doesn’t sound like there is any hope for reconciliation, so your primary focus should be on grieving the loss of your relationship and moving on, and I don’t think you can do so while remaining in constant contact with her. It’s very telling that you feel worse now, talking to her regularly, than you did when you two weren’t speaking. Tell her: “I can’t move on from our relationship while we’re still talking, so I’m not going to be able to maintain a friendship with you as long as I’m still getting over our breakup. I wish you all the best, but I can’t be your friend right now. Please respect my wishes and let me move on.” \nIf you’re worried she won’t honor your request, block her number and ask a friend or two to hold you accountable when it comes to contacting her. If—and this is such a remote contingency that i’m reluctant to bring it up for fear of giving you false hope—you two are ever going to re-establish a romantic connection, it can’t be as things are now. She dumped you cruelly because you wanted to get married. Even if you decide it’s worth foregoing marriage in order to be with you, you still need to address the power imbalance in your relationship, and you can’t do that by wanting less. If you two are ever going to reunite, it has to be on different terms, and it shouldn’t be simply because you can’t say “no” when she texts you. \nQ. Re: How to retreat from the company retreat?: There are so many red flags here. The mere fact that all of the women in the office are under 40 and all of the men are over 40 is suspicious. If none of the women showed up, do you really think the middle-aged men will sit around in the hot tub together? Every company retreat I’ve ever been on followed these rules: If it was staff only, it was held during regular business hours. If it was overnight, it was held at a hotel or resort of some type; spouses were invited (although the company might not have paid for their food etc.); and most of the team-building and other business activities were held during regular business hours. In both cases, if alcohol was involved, staff could purchase (or bring) their own, but it was never provided by the company. In my experience these have been standard practices since at least the 1990s. I would NOT go, and start looking for a new job. If none of the women showed up, do you really think the middle-aged men will sit around in the hot tub together? Advertisement \nA: I’ve gotten enough letters to the same effect that I think I should take your collective advice and amend my original response: Don’t go. This isn’t just a little off, it’s very off, and you should either claim a previously scheduled engagement or tell your boss why you won’t attend. Top Comment \ncan't the women all just say \"I don't want to drink or hot tub, I'm on my period\" and the older men will just back away slowly as though the young women might detonate with one wrong move? More... Join In \nQ. Recess: I have a son in kindergarten and for the last two weeks, he has told me that his class didn’t go to recess. The reasons have varied; the children were being disruptive during class, the teacher didn’t finish the lesson in time, they went to the computer lab instead, etc. I am very concerned about this. Children that age need a break during the day to run around and get out all that excess energy. They’ve already cut PE to once a week and now they don’t have recess anymore? Is this a big enough issue for me to bring it up to the teacher (possibly the principal?) or should I let it go and take my son to the park after school? \nA: I don’t see why you can’t bring it up with the teacher. Say, “My son tells me that the class hasn’t had recess over the last two weeks, and I’m concerned about it. Can you tell me the reasoning behind this decision?” Maybe he’s misunderstood something, maybe it’s a temporary response to a scheduling issue, maybe it’s a decision you disagree with and will want to discuss with other parents. You have every right to ask questions about your son’s schedule. \nMallory Ortberg: Thanks, everyone! Remember that bailing on THE HOLIDAYS is not always the first or best option, but it is always an option. No one will die if you don’t eat turkey with them on a particular Thursday.",

    "text": "FOREIGN WORKER BOOKS RIDE - HIS STORY WILL MAKE U APPRECIATE UR LIFE & UR FAMILY   Mon, 21/11/2016 - 9:26pm \n<Facebook post by Cassandra Tan> \nMy first passenger today brought me to tears and I had to hold it back till I dropped him off. \nAt 5.46am, I got a booking from Bt Timah Road. It didn't state what number, just the road name. I called him, he said he didn't know what number or where he was. He just said he was sitting at a bus stop at Bt Timah Road. Bt Timah Road is so long. I asked him to describe what he saw nearby. He said cars, trees, at a bus stop. I asked him to look for the bus stop number, I got silence and muffling sounds. \nSensing something very wrong, \nI said...just sit there and wait for me. I will find you! \nFrom where I was, I thought...if the booking came to me. He must be at the few bus stops nearest to me, but Bt Timah Road was left and right. So I tried the right side first. \nThere he was... a lone Indian foreign worker sitting at the bus stop, looking around aimlessly. \nI stopped my car, asked him if he had booked a car. He nodded. He opened the front door and asked if he could sit in front politely as he will vomit if he sit behind(his words). \nHe got in, I offered him a plastic bag and a sweet which he politely declined. \nI confirmed his dropoff address, he nodded. He was upset. So I drove on, leaving him to calm down. \nHalfway through, I asked him if he was okay. He nodded. \nSo I asked why he was at that bus stop (very quiet corner) so early that morning. He said he walked there. \nI said from where. \nApparently home was where I was sending him now....very far from where he was. \nSo I casually mentioned.... wow that's a very long walk. \nSo the talk continues... \nMe: So where are you from? Advertisement \nI then offered him some tissues and he took to wipe his tears... \nMe: It's ok. You can talk. \nSilence then then he spoke. \n(After this, I was quiet for a long time while he spoke) \nHis next words: my wife die after born my baby girl. In that little bit of English that he could speak.... He went on to say he and his wife were orphans at an orphanage and grew up together and fell in love. They had to \"betroth\"(his word \"sell\") their baby girl to a family in their village so they had money to pay for doctor visits for her pregnancy. The baby was supposed to be turned over to the family at age 12. His wife died during childbirth and the family had claimed the baby girl after the hospital turned her over to them. This man sitting next to me now will never have the chance to see his baby girl or even put his wife to rest. \nAfter I dropped him off, I declined to take his fare and even wanted to give him money for an airfare home. \nHe simply refused to take it and said no use go home. \nHe just said \"Thank you for hear me\" and left. \nHe probably needed to be alone now. \n4 hours later when I finished my driving.... as I was clearing my things, I found 2 $10 notes in a slot on the passenger door. He had stuck them there after I refused to take his fare. \nI tried calling him on the same number.... it has been off the last many hours. \nMy dear friends, give your kids and partner a good cuddle and many kisses today please! \n*Update* 21/11/116 \nI managed to call through the phone this morning. It was picked up by another Indian man who said the phone is actually his and the man (his friend) had left this morning for home. I asked how? He said \"Boss give money send\". He told me also....no call here again. I hope he will be blessed and find peace within himself soon. \nI didn't expect this post to go viral but thank you to everyone who shared to let people know what some of our foreign workers face.

And when it came time for me to dance with my father, we selected \"Tale as Old as Time\" from Beauty and the Beast (a favorite from my childhood). So, needless to say, I am very well-versed in selecting wedding songs from pop culture. Here are 13 more moving wedding songs from your favorite movie soundtracks and television shows.\n\"Bittersweet Symphony,\" Cruel Intentions Sure, that ending may not inspire feelings of romance—but the Verve&apos;s strings-heavy tune would make for an excellent processional.\n\"You&apos;ve Got a Friend in Me,\" Toy Story The sweetest option for a first dance—or parent&apos;s dance.\n\"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes,\" Cinderella Because you&apos;re living your real life fairy tale.\n\"Theme From Love Story,\" Love Story And because your love story is as romantic as the movies.\n\"A Thousand Years,\" Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2 If it&apos;s good enough for Bella and Edward, it&apos;s good enough for us.\n\"Casper&apos;s Lullaby,\" Casper The friendly ghost surprisingly has some really pretty tunes (and we think this one is ideal for coming down the aisle).\n\"Anyone Else But You,\" Juno This dance option is quirky-and-cute, just like the movie.\n\"Where You Lead,\" Gilmore Girls Carole King&apos;s (and Rory and Lorelai&apos;s) hit would make for a fun first dance.\n\"The Portrait,\" Titanic Another moving processional option.\n\"So This Is Love,\" Cinderella This Disney princess is bringing all the wedding day hits.\n\"Opening Theme,\" The Notebook Take a note from Noah and Allie.\n\"I Will Follow You,\" Apple iPhone 7 commercial Granted, it&apos;s a commercial.

If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nToronto Mayor John Tory will make a push for tolls on both the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway in an effort to boost the city’s coffers, sources told Global News. \nTory’s announcement will signal a shift in stance for the mayor who in the past has said he is not in favour of tolls on Toronto highways. Story continues below \nTory is expected to introduce his plan Thursday at a lunchtime speech at the Toronto Board of Trade. \nThe speech will take place after the city releases a new report recommending tolling and new taxes on hotel stays as the city grapples with an infrastructure deficit estimated to be at least $33 billion, according to city officials. \nREAD MORE: Tolls on the Gardiner Expressway and DVP: Freeway or feeway? \nTory won’t be pushing to sell off Toronto Hydro though. \nAbout 228,000 vehicles travel on the Gardiner east of Highway 427 on a daily basis while about 100,000 drive on the DVP north of the Bayview-Bloor exit. \nIn March, the City of Toronto issued a request for proposals to determine how to implement tolls on the Gardiner Expressway and the Don Valley Parkway. \nThe city would need the province’s approval in order to implement the tolls as well as the tax on hotel rooms. \nA staff report released last fall on tolling options saw drivers pay a flat fee of between $1.25 to $3.25 for either a 10-year or 30-year time frame respectively. \nThe city would need the province’s approval in order to implement the tolls as well as the tax on hotel rooms. \nWith files from David Shum and Mark McAllister © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

(photo credit:REUTERS)   \nDespite the relative calm, firefighters are still patrolling Haifa’s streets, remaining on a 24 hours on/24 hours off shift instead of the usual 24 on/48 off work schedule.“Right now everything is a bit calmer, there are not a lot of fires, just hot spots, nothing we can’t handle,” Haifa firefighter Eitan Ripps, 37, told The Jerusalem Post by phone from one of the city’s fire stations on Saturday. “It is not easy, it has been a lot of days away from home – not seeing the family kids – but you know, we’ll get through this together.”   According to Ripps, who has been in the line of duty for 13 years, the recent fires were the most dangerous he has seen. (Fires in Israel) “The last time it was the 2010 [Mount] Carmel [forest] fire but even the oldest firefighters, who have been here for 40 years never saw anything like what happened [last week],” remarked Ripps. “It is not like a forest fire, everything was inside the city.”A Haifa fire department spokesman told the Post that the biggest challenge was dealing with the scale of the urban fire.“It makes a big difference because when you are dealing with protecting lives it is obviously a much bigger challenge than protecting trees,” he said.Tel Aviv firefighter Yaakov “Grizzly” Guttman, 32, who spent the week fighting fires in Zichron Ya’acov and in Sha’ar Hagai, west of Jerusalem, was recovering on Saturday night after a grueling week and preparing to go back on call on Sunday.“I felt a huge sense of honor. I never faced anything this size, everybody pushed their limits,” said Guttman, who worked an almost 72-hour shift. “Seeing five- or seven-meter high flames and knowing that if this gets past you it is going to hit citizens and civilians – I felt a huge sense of honor.”For Guttman, the greatest challenge was keeping in contact with his wife, who is due to give birth in two weeks.“My phone went completely dead for a few days,” he said. “You want to be with your family and your friends, but you also have a massive responsibility to the people and to the country.”Fire and Rescue Authority spokesman Yoram Levi told the Post on Saturday the fires have been largely extinguished.“Basically it is over,” he said, adding “we are preparing ourselves for a few more days with extreme weather conditions.”  ",

    "text": "Net migration to be 80,000 a year lower after Brexit, OBR says Immigration and passport control, Terminal 2, Heathrow Airport, London, United Kingdom Credit: wronaphoto.com / Alamy Ben Riley-Smith , Assistant Political Editor  14pm \nB ritain’s net migration will be 80,000 a year lower after leaving the EU, the country’s independent forecaster has said. \nThe Office of Budget Responsibility [OBR] said net immigration will be 185,000 a year rather than the 265,000 a year that was expected. \nThe news was welcomed by Eurosceptics who argued it “vindicated” their calls during the referendum that leaving the EU would help curb migration. \nThere will however be knock-on effects to the economy, with an extra £16bn of borrowing estimated to be needed until 2020 to cover the drop. \nDespite the reduction in immigration, the Tories are still forecast to miss their target of lowering net migration to below 100,000 after Brexit. Watch | Michael Gove says points based immigration system is fair 01:17 \nP hilip Hammond, the Chancellor, has admitted that a “longer time frame” than five years was needed to hit the target. \nIt is one of the first times a Tory front-bencher has conceded that net migration will not drop into the \"tens of thousands\" by the 2020 election. \nDuring the referendum those arguing to leave the EU put the ability to bring down migration at the heart of their pitch to voters. \nBoris Johnson and Michael Gove repeatedly attacked the Tory leadership for saying the pledge could be hit while remaining in the EU. \n“It is deeply corrosive of popular trust in politics that every year people in power say they can cut immigration to tens of thousands and then fail,” Mr Johnson said before the vote. Autumn Statement | Key points \n“We have absolutely no power to control the number of people coming. I am in favour of immigration but also in favour of control.” \nF or the first time since the Brexit vote, the OBR has revealed what it expects to happen to immigration in the coming years. \nLeaving the EU will bring “lower net migration than would otherwise have been the case”, the OBR said. \nThe body said there would be “tighter” controls on migration and that “pull factors attracting migrants to the UK may be less powerful than previously”. \nNet migration will be 80,000 a year lower than expected as a result, the OBR said. Without the Brexit vote net migration was expected to drop to 265,000 a year beyond 2020. Instead it will fall to 185,000 a year. \nAndrew Bridgen, the Tory MP for North West Leicestershire who backed Brexit, said the lower immigration forecast “vindicates the claims made by the Leave side in the referendum debate”. \nLord Green of Deddington, the chairman of Migration Watch, said: “If the main reduction in immigration is achieved by cutting out low paid immigrants from the EU, as we have proposed, there is no reason to think that there will be a significant reduction in revenue because these workers pay little or no tax.” \nThe projections do not specifically take into account a new work permits scheme being planned by the Home Office, the details of which are yet to be announced. At a glance | What does JAM mean? \nM rs May has repeatedly said that Britain voted for “control” over its borders at the referendum – suggesting she backs a yearly cap on the number of EU nationals who can move to the UK. \nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mr Hammond appeared to concede that the Government would miss its ambition to bring net migration below 100,000 a year before the 2020 election. \nAlison McGovern, the Labour MP for Wirral South, asked whether Mr Hammond had asked the OBR to “adjust” their migration forecasts because it showed the Tory target will be missed. \nMr Hammond responded: “No. The Prime Minister’s been very clear that it remains her target to achieve immigration reduced to the tens of thousands. But she’s also been clear that it will take time to achieve. \n“The OBR forecast stretches over a period of five years and the Prime Minister is absolutely clear that this is a target that will be achieved over a longer time frame in order to manage the impact on the economy.” Follow Telegraph News",

Despite the huge diversity of gut bacteria, two main response patterns emerged in the study -- microbe species either increased or decreased in their abundance depending on the animal's protein and carbohydrate intake. Credit: © zuki70 / Fotolia Close Scientists are one step closer to understanding the link between different diet strategies and gut health, with new research presenting the first general principles for how diet impacts the microbiota. \nResearchers from the University of Sydney have found that the availability of intestinal nitrogen to microbes in the gut plays a key role in regulating interactions between gut microbes and their host animal. The study is published today in Cell Metabolism and led by researchers at the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre. \n\"There are many different diet strategies that claim to promote gut health, and until now it has been very difficult to establish clear causality between various types of diet and their effect on the host's microbiome. This is because there are many complex factors at play, including food composition, eating pattern and genetic background,\" said lead author Associate Professor Andrew Holmes, from the Charles Perkins Centre and School of Life and Environmental Sciences. \n\"This research really lays the groundwork for future modelling by setting out the rules for a general model of how diet shapes the gut ecosystem. The simple explanation is that when we eat in a way that encourages cooperation between ourselves and bacteria we achieve a good microbiome, but when we eat in a way that doesn't require cooperation this lets bacteria do whatever they want -- and mischief can ensue.\" \nThe balance of gut bacteria in the microbiome plays a key role in such functions as immune regulation and digestive wellbeing, and has been linked to other health outcomes like obesity. Past studies have identified several patterns for how diet influences the microbiome, yet this has not led to a workable model that explains microbial response across many different types of diets. \nThis new research is the latest in a series stemming from a seminal study in which 25 different diets composed of different amounts of protein, carbohydrates and fat were systematically varied in 858 mice. \nDespite the huge diversity of gut bacteria, two main response patterns emerged in the study -- microbe species either increased or decreased in their abundance depending on the animal's protein and carbohydrate intake. \n\"The largest nutrient requirements for our gut bacteria are carbon and nitrogen in the foods we eat. As carbohydrates contain no nitrogen but protein does, the bacterial community response to the host animal's diet is strongly affected by this diets' protein-carbohydrate ratio,\" said Associate Professor Holmes. \n\"The fact that this same pattern was seen across almost all groups of gut bacteria indicates that the makeup of the microbial ecosystem is fundamentally shaped by a need to access nitrogen in the intestinal environment.\" \nThe researchers' new model suggests that while high-carbohydrate diets were the most likely to support positive interactions in the microbiome, such benefits were relative to the protein intake of the host animal. \nResearchers hope the new findings will lay the foundations for more accurate computer simulations to test hundreds of different diet variants, helping to better predict which dietary combinations lead to optimal gut health. \n\"There are many ways to achieve a good diet, and the same diet won't work in the same way in each person,\" said co-author Professor Stephen Simpson, Academic Director of the Charles Perkins Centre. \n\"The next step will be to more rapidly characterise which dietary combinations promote the best outcomes for each of our gut microbiomes, and to this end we are developing a computer simulation for how this might work in practice.\" \n  University of Sydney   Andrew J.

    "text": "BEIJING: China has ordered all residents in its Muslim-majority Xinjiang province to surrender their passports in a bid to \"maintain social order\" and prevent them from moving abroad, days after the Communist nation tightened rules to suppress religious freedom in the restive region. \n\nThe northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has tightened passport regulations, requiring all residents to hand in their passports to local police for examination and management, state-run Global Times reported today. \n\nAll citizens in Aksu prefecture are required to hand their passports - private or official - to local police stations, the daily reported quoting an anonymous police officer. \n\n\"Anyone who needs the passport must apply to the police station,\" the official said, adding that the new passport management policy is implemented throughout Xinjiang. \n\nThe Public Security Bureau in Shihezi city gave the same directive last month saying it was for \"annual examination\" purposes. \"Those who refuse to hand in their passports should bear the responsibility themselves if they are forbidden from going abroad,\" the directive said. \n\nA resident from Kashar city, bordering Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), told the daily she received a call asking her to hand over her passport to police. She said her husband's passport application was denied by the police a few days ago. \n\nA local official told the daily that Xinjiang government had loosened control over residents' passports in 2015. The new policy is aimed at maintaining social order, he said. \n\nThe latest directive follows an order reported yesterday, requiring all residents to report to authorities all religious activities, including circumcision, weddings and funerals. \n\nGetting a passport is often complicated and takes more time in Xinjiang than in other provinces, given the increased threat of terrorism in the region and the government's ongoing anti-terrorism campaign, an official in the province said. \n\nThe passport policy also comes amid steady migration of Uyghurs, Turkik-speaking Muslims to Turkey and other nations. \n\nAccording to reports, hundreds of Uyghur youths have been fighting along with the Islamic State group in Syria, and China believes that the battle-hardened militants may return to cause more violence in the troubled province. \n\nThe resource-rich Xinjiang, bordering PoK and Afghanistan, has been on the boil for more than six years as the local Uyghur Muslims are upset over over the increasing settlement of Han Chinese from other provinces. \n\nThe province has witnessed some of the most deadly terrorist attacks, officially blamed on East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which was previously linked to the al-Qaeda but now has declared its allegiance to Islamic State. \n\nETIM was blamed for a suicide attack on the Chinese Embassy in Kyrgyzstan in September.

    "text": "VOICES Why Modi is the champion of rollbacks The average citizen is finding it hard to keep track of the U-turns on what one can and cannot do with one's own money. 3149 @ashoupadhyay On November 23, when parties like Trinamool Congress and AAP vehemently opposed the demonetisation drive and demanded its rollback, Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu said rollbacks have no place in Narendra Modi's book. Addressing a \"mahapanchayat\" of Delhi Dehat Kisan Mazdoor in the capital, he said, \"Wapas lena Modi ji ke khoon mein nahi hai\". On November 8, while announcing the decision to demonetise these two notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said, \"From 10th November till 24th November the limit for such exchange (of old notes) will be four thousand rupees. From 25th November till 30th December, the limit will be increased.\" On November 17, this decision was amended. People were allowed to exchange only Rs 2,000 as limit got reduced. On November 24, the Centre announced that the exchange of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for new currency was being stopped at all banks. So, while Modi promised the nation that the exchange limit would be increased from November 24, he actually stopped it on the same date. And so he did go back on one of his promises yet one of his ministers said, \" Wapas lena Modi ji ke khoon mein nahi hai! \" The government has, on an average, reversed its own rules at a rate of three times a day. Credit: PTI This is not the first change made by the Modi government since the demonetisation drive kicked off on November 8. So far, 50 decisions in 17 days have been taken by the government on demonetisation and, it has, on an average reversed its own rules at a rate of three times a day. Both the number and intensity of changes are so high that very few lawmakers would be aware of them. The average citizen is finding it hard to keep track of all the decisions on what one can and cannot do with one's own money. The BJP may say that rolling back is not in Modi's blood but several U-turns of the government on different aspects of demonetisation defy their claim. The Narendra Modi government seems to be in the habit of rolling back decisions. One newspaper report counted 25 U-turns in the first 180 days of Narendra Modi.Land Acquisition was one of the biggest examples of flip-flops and rollbacks of Modi government. His Pakistan policy too has seen several flip-flop-flips like the time when talks were cancelled after their envoy called a meeting with Hurriyat leaders ahead of the India-Pakistan bilateral talks only to change its stance later. The decision to ban websites which contained pornographic material was revoked after facing the wrath of netizens. In the last Union Budget, the government had turned 60 per cent of the corpus in EPF into a taxable component, but after facing unprecedented flak, that too was rolled back. These were but a few examples there have been many more and while many of Modi government's decisions were ill-conceived and had to be retracted later, others were rolled back when the government succumbed to public and political pressure. Every government does it and there is nothing wrong in accepting one's mistakes or amending decisions or policies. But making frequent U-turns and yet saying that rolling back is not in Narendra Modi's blood is definitely stretching things beyond acceptability or as one would say in Hindi, Venkaiahji, Yeh baat kuch hazam nahi hui. #Demonetisation , #Modi government The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

    "text": "Zero Waste Living: Everything You Need to Know How to reduce your impact on the environment 28/11/2016 11:17 Susan Devaney \nFrom clothes and food to stuff , how many times per week do you throw out unloved, unwanted or unused waste? The simple answer lies in your bin. \nAs scientists continue to tell us our planet is getting hotter at an alarming rate, 2016 is a time for big changes, starting at home. According to Rutland County Council , on average every person in the UK throws away their own body weight in rubbish every 7 weeks. From green and brown to blue, households across the planet are successfully adopting a colour-coded recycling scheme to try to reduce our carbon footprint. \nBut leaders of a zero-waste lifestyle movement are challenging the notion that we could (and should) be doing more, and proving it’s possible. \nLast year, New Yorker Lauren Singer packed her annual waste into one, small glass jar. How did she do it? Lauren Singer \n“Whether it is saying no to single use plastic straws wherever you go or opting to always carry a reusable tote bag, there are lots of easy things to do that have a long term and large scale positive environmental (and economic) impact,” says Singer, Founder of Trash is for Tossers and CEO of The Simply Co . \nKeeping in mind that each UK household produces over 1 tonne of rubbish annually, amounting to about 31 million tonnes each year – not including the rest of our planet’s waste – the small things really do matter. “I started small and did a few things at a time so it wasn’t overwhelming. I made toothpaste for the first time because I was out of toothpaste and didn’t want to buy another tube. I didn’t make any other new product until I finished the store bought one that I had. Doing things that way really helped to pace out the things that I was doing and make them super easy and fun,” explains Singer. Trash Is For Tossers \nLauren’s blog is full of helpful tips and detailed advice for minimising waste like storing dry food in jars and using bamboo compostable toothbrushes. It also lists easy ways to adjust your weekly shopping list to help reduce your carbon footprint. And that means asking for your fresh fish to be put into a glass jar you brought along with you – a zero-waste lifestyle means saying no to plastic packaging for good. \nShe’s not the only one. Young millennial women are actively reducing their household waste on a phenomenal scale. As Europe vows to reduce our GHG (Greenhouse Gas Emissions) by 20 percent by 2020 and by 40 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 , addressing our household waste is the key to it’s success. \n“We eat fresh, simple, and healthful meals instead of spending a lot on takeout and disposables, and walk or bike instead of spending a lot on cabs. Making my own simple household and beauty products frees up money and time for things I really enjoy,” says Ariana Schwarz of Paris to Go . Paris To Go \nMaking the switch in 2014, Schwarz (like Singer) started making small adjustments to her daily life, going back to her old lifestyle now seems impossible. “Drink tap water, pack a few reusable shopping bags in your car or purse, try a bamboo toothbrush, bring lunch instead of buying in the cafeteria, and eat meatless one day a week (even better if you eat vegan). These all require minimal adjustment, but can have a major impact on an individual’s carbon footprint,” says Schwarz. Paris To Go \nThe secret formula is if you have less, you waste less. What’s there to lose? \n\nLearn more about sustainability, visit Electrify the World – a Nissan Intelligent Mobility Initiative Learn more about sustainability, visit Electrify The World - A Nissan Mobility Initiative More:",

    "text": "by Darren Hartwell on Tue, Nov 29, 2016 at 1:47PM 1,337 Tweet \nIt doesn’t take a genius to figure out Bart Scott isn’t a fan of Bill Belichick and the New England Patriots. \nSo, keep that in mind when you read this scorcher of a hot take Scott dropped Monday on CBS Sports Radio’s “The D.A. Show” involving Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. \n“Gronk’s on his way out (of New England),” the former New York Jets linebacker told host Damon Amendolara. “Because of injuries, and they don’t stick with you when they see you slipping. When you have a big man that starts having back problems — he’s only in his seventh year, and he has two years remaining. And guess what? They already brought in his replacement and they can get him for cheaper.” \nThat’s right: Scott believes the Patriots are ready to cut ties with Gronkowski, insisting they already have a serviceable tight end in Martellus Bennett, who’s actually two years older than the 27-year-old All-Pro. \n“Don’t matter. Less wear and tear on the body,” Scott said of Bennett. “Listen, we had some great players in basketball. When did you know it was over with Larry Bird? When he would go to the sideline and put that hot pack on his back.” \nGronkowski left Sunday’s game against the Jets with a back injury and already has missed three of New England’s 11 games this season. He’s still the NFL’s best tight end when healthy, though, leading all qualified tight ends with 21.6 yards per catch this season. \nBut don’t tell that to Scott, who predicts Belichick will give Gronk the same treatment he gave Jamie Collins and Chandler Jones . \n“We talk about knee injuries, back injuries, elbow brace forever,” Scott said, trailing off. “Listen, man, you think Bill Belichick (is) going to stick with you? Negative. He’s not in the foxhole with you.” \nThumbnail photo via Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Darren Hartwell? Send it to him via Twitter at @darren_hartwell . ",

In 2013, there were an estimated one million people living with colon and rectum cancer America, according to government figures . \nLindsay's account - which begins 'dear every cancer patient I ever took care of, I’m sorry. I didn’t get it' - has resonated with thousands and inspired hundreds to share their own experiences with cancer. \nDespite having been involved in 'countless' diagnosis conversations, she admitted: 'I didn't get what it felt like to actually hear the words.' \nShe added: 'You probably went home and broke down under the weight of what you had just been told. \n'You probably sat in silence and disbelief for hours until you had to go pretend everything was fine at work or wherever because you didn’t have any details yet and wanted to keep it private still. \n'You probably didn’t even know where to start and your mind went straight to very dark places. That day was the worst. I’m sorry. I didn’t get it.' \nShe also confessed to not having known 'how hard the waiting is', the 'awkward' experience of telling others the life-changing news and what it feels like 'to get sad looks all the time'. \nShe added: 'I didn’t get how much you hung on to every word I said to you...I didn’t get how much you googled.' \nLindsay said she had not been aware of how strange it felt to be referred to as 'brave'. \nNew perspective: The 33-year-old said her diagnosis has transformed her understanding of what it is like to live with the disease\nBalancing act: Lindsay, who is in the first stage of treatment, is still working full-time and is mother to Evelyn, seven months, and Harrison, three\n'Getting treatment because I have to doesn’t really make me feel like much of a hero,' she added. \nEnding the open letter, Lindsay said 'nobody' knows what it is like to be a cancer patient but that she hopes she able to provide her patients with 'a little guidance and strength' to help them through the ordeal. \nLindsay - who is still working full-time and is mother to Evelyn, seven months, and Harrison, three - said she wrote the letter because since her diagnosis she kept thinking about how she treated patients. \nShe told Daily Mail Online: 'I couldn’t help thinking back to all the questions I got from patients and wondering if I did enough or if I said the wrong thing. \n'Every step I’ve taken through the process so far has been eye opening, making me realize “oh, so this is what they were talking about “ or “so this is how this feels”. \n'I just feel like I could relate in a different way and I was inspired to write about my new perspective.' \nLindsay is currently undergoing radiation and oral chemotherapy daily. When that is complete she will have a six week break before having surgery in January followed by another six week break and four months of IV chemotherapy. \nShe said: 'I’m stage three, so thankfully it’s not spread to other parts of my body, but the risk of recurrence is very real so I’ll be watched very closely for the years to come.' \nWorking is a 'great distraction', she said, but balancing treatment, work and family life can be challenging. \nNot prepared: Despite having been involved in 'countless' diagnosis conversations, she admitted that she 'didn't get what it felt like to actually hear the words'\nSupport: She said her husband Camden, 37, who works in sales, is her 'rock'\nShe said her husband Camden, 37, who works in sales, is her 'rock'. \nShe added: 'He’s picked up most of the housework and taking care of the kids as much as possible to give me rest. \n'Trying to keep up with my own expectations of being a good mother is probably the hardest part, but just spending time with them is the best medicine. \n'I’ve learned it’s OK if the house isn’t perfect - we have each other.' \nShe said being diagnosed with cancer soon after giving birth and with two small children was 'overwhelming'. \n\n'I quickly learned that taking it one step at a time is the only way to approach it,' she added. \nSince her diagnosis Lindsay said she has become 'more patient and understanding' in her job. \nShe added: 'I've always done my best to try and place myself in my patients shoes- but now that I have first hand experience of what this feels like, I'm hoping I can be an even better resource... \n'I've already noticed my friends at work asking for advice on how to guide a patient through a particular experience.'",

    "text": "Next step set for £7m Porthcawl maritime centre 29 November 2016 Image copyright Porthcawl Harbourside Image caption Artist's impression of the maritime centre and harbour area from above A planned £7m maritime centre for the south Wales seaside town of Porthcawl is set to take a big step forward as its backers prepare to launch a search for contractors to build it. \nPorthcawl Harbourside said work should begin in mid 2017, with the building expected to open by 2018 or 2019. \nIt will house water sport and exercise facilities, a coastal science centre, a cafe and an outdoor theatre. \nThe project was awarded a £1.1m Heritage Lottery grant in October. \nThe money will go towards developing the land, which is owned by Bridgend council. \nPorthcawl Harbourside was formed by a collaboration between the Welsh Surfing Federation and Porthcawl Sea Cadets with involvement from two of the now-directors, town councillor and former mayor Mike Clarke and Stuart Bentley, a resident with a background in architecture. \nMr Clarke said the Cosy Corner site where the centre would be built - named after the former Cosy Cinema which stood on the area along with a skating rink - will reflect its history as a \"bustling centre of activity and a magnet for tourists\". Image caption Cosy Corner is next to the lifeboat station and the Jennings building (left), which is being renovated Image caption The former site of a cinema, skating rink and paddling pool Image copyright Porthcawl Museum Image caption In previous decades the area had fountains in the central water feature Image copyright Porthcawl Museum Image caption Later on, it was a paddling pool, as pictured in this postcard from the late 60s or early 70s \nOperations manager Mark Bryant told BBC Wales the group expected to get to the procurement stage \"this side of Christmas\" when an invitation to tender would go out to find a contractor to build the centre. \nAccording to Mr Bryant, support from the local community has been \"incredible\". \n\"We couldn't have done it without them. They've been instrumental in getting it off the ground,\" he said. \n\"We're working with the Chamber of Commerce to the Civic Trust to the YMCA. They've all been really supportive. \n\"The whole town has really come together behind it.\" \nHe said a key philosophy behind the project, which is run on a not-for-profit basis, was social benefits for the whole community. The centre is aiming to offer 50 full-time equivalent jobs. Image copyright Porthcawl Harbourside Image caption The centre promises science and sporting facilities as well as workspaces and a cafe \nThe site will offer a coastal maritime science and discovery centre, including environmental, culture, local history and community learning in partnership with Swansea University, and a public viewing gallery nicknamed the crow's nest with a camera obscura - which allows people to look out to sea - and facilities for lifeguards and emergency services. \nThe National Governing Body of Surfing in Wales and the Sea Cadets will be based there, along with a Welsh surf museum, a gym, training pool, water sport facilities with toilets and shower facilities and conference space for up to 100 people. \nThere will also be an indoor gallery and an outdoor amphitheatre, along with office space, accommodation and a cafe/bistro open into the evening, which Mr Bryant said would be a training cafe offering opportunities for catering students. \nThe harbour area of the town is one of the places where work has progressed in recent years, while other schemes to regenerate the town centre have stalled. Image caption The Jennings building is being redeveloped as a workspace and restaurant \nIn a separate development, work began in September on restoring the Grade II-listed Jennings building which has overlooked the harbour for more than 180 years. \nThe developers, ABA Holdings, are converting it into commercial units, with a theatre-style restaurant and bar and 13 home studios with bedrooms which will allow people to live and work on site. \nThose units are already rented, according to the council. \nResponses from the local community have been positive in the main, although there have been some concerns raised about a lack of parking associated with the project. \nJo Richards, whose family has run Walters Shoes in Porthcawl for 140 years, said the project was a \"great thing\" for the town. \n\"I think it will be great for footfall in the town, which a small town like Porthcawl always needs,\" she said. \n\"There hasn't been any major non-commercial development for a long time. Almost everyone has welcomed it.\" \nSophie Evans, who works at the Marine Hotel on the seafront, said: \"I think it's a good idea because it will bring more people to Porthcawl. Particularly if it brings more people in the winter months, because that's when we need people. \n\"It will will be good to have something there because when my parents were younger it was busy. It doesn't seem like it's used much.\"",

Copy Link \nSpace World, a theme park located in Kitakyushu, Japan, has found itself with some explaining to do after a public outcry over their most recent attempt at wooing visitors. The park created an attraction known as an “ice aquarium” which consisted of 5,000 fish frozen into the water with their bodies spelling out symbols and words such as “hello.” \nWhile the concept is something of a surprise, the public reaction is just what you’d expect. People, both local and distant, are furious. The park’s Facebook page became a depository for angry messages and jokes over the stunt, causing the park to close the exhibit on Sunday. \nHere’s what the scene looked like at the park. It’s as bizarre as you would expect: \nAnd the very images that were used in the promotion of the attraction are now the source of outrage and shock online: \nOne piece of pertinent, yet previously unannounced, information against charges of animal cruelty was released in response to the backlash. The Japan Times ran a statement from Space World which read: \nA spokesperson told the Asahi Shimbun that the park was considering holding a memorial service for the fish next year, adding that the fish were already dead when they were bought from a local wholesaler. \n“Misunderstandings spread on the internet that the fish were frozen while they were still alive, but that was not the case,” the spokesperson told the newspaper. “We should have explained more.” \nYes, they probably should have explained more. And while the fact that the fish were dead might mitigate some outrage, it doesn’t exactly put the stunt in the realm of good taste. If you’re thinking that using a fish for an amusement park novelty is more than a little wasteful, well, the park seems to hear you on that front, too, as the fish, when thawed, will be used as fertilizer.

Leung lives in a flat with his family, but chooses to sleep on the boat two to three nights a week. Who can blame him? He has 1,500 sq ft of space here – compared to 300 sq ft at home – that costs only HK$1,500 a month for anchorage.\nLeung believes life afloat could be an ideal stopgap measure for young couples struggling to find affordable housing. But his advert offering the floating home for lease landed him in hot water with the Marine Department earlier this year.\nOfficials informed him that, as the holder of a leisure boat licence, a long-term accommodation arrangement with a third party would breach hotel and guest house regulations. Had his boat been moored in the more exclusive environs of a yacht club, he’d probably have escaped scrutiny from the department’s patrol vessels. \n“I have friends who’ve had to remain apart since they got married, and others living in subdivided flats. Why can’t they buy a boat to live on?” says Leung, who bought his for HK$300,000 several years ago, and points out that a car parking space costs about HK$1 million.\nLeung says he had also hoped to help revive the centuries-old tradition of living at sea in Hong Kong, where fishing was a major industry until the 1960s, when more than 10,000 boats plied their trade.\nA tough crew: Hong Kong fishermen tell their life stories to young generation \nAs fishing and agriculture waned into relative insignificance amid the boom in manufacturing and service industries, and a series of fires and typhoons wreaked havoc among fisherfolk, the city’s boat dwellers began migrating into public housing estates. According to the Marine Department, only four “squatter boat” licences remain valid from that era. \nThe shortage of housing has been a perennial hot button issue for the Hong Kong administration, and flat prices have become increasingly out of reach for many residents – especially the young.\nAccording to government statistics, more than 90 per cent of Hongkongers under the age of 25 still live with their parents. To be eligible for public housing, single applicants must earn no more than HK$10,970 per month. Even when the requirement is met, it can be take more than 10 years to be allocated a flat because the elderly and families top the waiting list.\nYoung singles in Hong Kong deprived of basic right to public housing, judicial review hears \nYoung people who came out onto the streets during the 2014 Occupy protests citied the inability to live independently due to exorbitant property prices as a major grievance – although it was essentially a protest against the failure of political reform.\nSeeking to address the problem, the government announced a scheme that same year to build hostels in Jordan, Mong Kok, Sheung Wan and Tai Po, with rooms for let to young people at a discount to the market rate. The hostels are still under construction and no date has been given for their completion.\nAccountant Hugo Kwok and friends have come up with a solution to help young couples move out of their parents’ homes until they can find a more private solution. In April they formed a collective called Tai Tung Co-housing, to help young couples cohabit apartments with other couples. The rent per person is about HK$3,000.\nAn estate agency is on board, one that previously helped landlords turn their apartments into hostels for students. Each couple gets their own bedroom with basic furnishings including a bed and wardrobe. \nWriting in the Hong Kong Economic Journal , Kwok says the concept of co-living also entails joint responsibility for household chores.\n“Besides sharing facilities such as the kitchen, living room and toilet, co-housers must assume different responsibilities, including cooking and cleaning. By sharing facilities, people can build a closer relationship with their flatmates, and improve their social lives and living environment,” Kwok says. \nIn recent years, a culture of co-living arrangements for friends has taken root in Tokyo and Taipei, crowded cities that face housing problems similar to Hong Kong’s. 9floor Co-space in Taipei accommodates about 60 flatmates in 10 apartments.\nKwok writes that co-housing is an appropriate lifestyle option for young people living in a modern capitalist society.\nHong Kong think tank believes subsidised homeownership scheme would help fix ‘unjust’ public housing policy \n“Our target is people who can’t afford rent ... and want to meet more new people to expand their social network. By sharing rent, their cost of living can be reduced. Many people think that they don’t want to interact with others after work. They think that a home should be a totally private space for relaxation. [But] if interpersonal relationships are confined to only the work environment, will people become more alienated and self-centred in their downtime?”\nIn October, the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, a federation representing about 400 NGOs, floated the idea of temporary housing estates built using converted shipping containers. They could be developed in abandoned car parks or under flyovers, and serve as a temporary measure to relieve the housing problem, it said. \nThe council’s idea is based on a concept pioneered in the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, which launched a scheme to provide temporary student housing more than a decade ago. The stacked containers, each measuring about 200 sq ft, are insulated and fitted with a bathroom, open kitchen, air conditioner and windows. The homes can withstand most climatic conditions, according to planners.\nCheap Hong Kong-designed ‘container homes’ the way of the future \nVincent Ng, president of the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, says there needs to be a multipronged, long-term approach to tackling the city’s housing shortage. \n“In 30 years working as an architect, I’ve seen people’s homes getting smaller and smaller. Property developers see housing as a commodity to maximise their profits, instead of a place for people to live,” he says.\n“Such unconventional living concepts as shipping containers are not new. The idea was proposed by academics some years ago. For such temporary housing, you have to find land to house them. And you have to go through the Town Planning Board and [district councils] and so on.\n“At some point in the future, you have to relocate the people living there, so it needs a comprehensive plan … The time needed to complete all those procedures might be similar to that for construction of a public housing estate. In the long term, the government has to identify land for constructing permanent housing for common people, not luxury property buyers.”\nHong Kong’s country park land not the solution for housing shortage \nBoating enthusiast Leung, who worked in the maritime trade before retirement, is adamant that living on the water should not be ruled out in Hong Kong, although he concedes it’s not a long-term solution – especially for landlubbers who get seasick.\nAcquiring a leisure boat licence is easy, he says. “You just need to know how to swim a short distance and finish an exam paper of multiple-choice questions. “Afterwards, you get an instructor to teach you how to pilot the boat. It’s easier than playing video games.”\nIt’s not all plain sailing, though, Leung admits. There are practical concerns, such as water and electricity supply, but he overcame them using his nous. He had solar panels installed on the top deck to provide electricity for a fridge, heater and stove. A diesel generator powers hungrier appliances, such as the air conditioner, but he says he rarely uses it.\nSegro tackles London housing shortage with homes-cum-warehouses approach \nLeung also built a water retention pool on the boat’s roof, connected to pipes extending downstairs to the kitchen and toilet. “A downpour can yield more than 2,000 litres of water, enough for my whole family of four for a week. I can also go ashore to get water, but it’s troublesome,” he says.\n“The biggest difficulty is the need for a feeder boat to go ashore. I have one myself which I bought for tens of thousands of dollars some years ago.”\nOn the October day we visit, the roof of the boat is blistering hot because his tarpaulin cover had been destroyed during a typhoon. Leung says other maintenance costs have been negligible.\n“Renewing my leisure boat licence costs only HK$2,000 a year, and insurance sets me back HK$5,000 a year.”\nIt’s all worth it, he says. “I lived near the Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter when I was young, so I’ve always loved the sea. I love jumping into the water after I wake up, and looking at the starry night sky from the deck.”",

He would do a great job!' \nAfter successfully campaigning for Britain to leave the EU Mr Farage joined Mr Trump at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was lauded as 'the man behind Brexit'. \nFollowing a campaign run on similar anti- establishment lines to the Leave campaign , the Republican described a victory as 'Brexit plus plus plus' on the eve of the vote. \nFriends: Farage came to the US to support Trump on the campaign trail and the president elect said that America had been inspired by the Brexit campaign\nDays after the win the pair appeared together in a golden lift following a private meeting at the president-elect's New York residence, Trump Tower. \nBy comparison Mrs May had only spoken to Mr Trump over the phone, after reportedly waiting for a string of other leaders to congratulate the winner. \nNo 10 later rejected suggestions Mr Farage could be the 'third person' in the relationship between the PM and her US counterpart and insisted that the Government had 'well-established' channels of communication. \nIn the immediate wake of Mr Trump's election a leaked memo reportedly sent by Britain's incumbent ambassador, Sir Kim Darroch, sought to reassure the Government that UK diplomats were 'well placed' to capitalise on change at the White House. \nHowever Mr Farage said it was 'obvious' that Sir Kim, who took over in January, should resign as he was part of the 'old regime'. \n'His world view, and the world view of the Trump team are going to be diametrically opposed and I would have thought it would be sensible to put someone there who was likely to get on with Team Trump,' he told Sky News. \n'I don't think I will be the ambassadorial type. Whatever talents or flaws I have got I don't think diplomacy is at the top of my list of skills.'",

READ MORE Governor Ruto tells Kenyans to get rid of Jubilee in the next polls \nOuko said the project was not budgeted for in the 2014-2015 financial year, adding that the Sh155 million used to put up the facility was not provided for in the programme-based budget. \nOuko noted that money meant for projects in the education department was diverted to the the stadium project. \n\"The funds were drawn from three other votes in the education department to finance construction of the stadium,\" he added. \nAlthough the project was contained in the county's Integrated Development Plan for 2013-2018, its construction was dogged by financial irregularities. \nThe auditor said Sh48.9 million spent on wages to casual workers involved in the project could not be accounted for. \n\"The master roll used in paying workers was not properly maintained, as it did not indicate the rate paid, the total amount payable to each of the casual workers and the number of days worked,\" he said.

(credit: 1010 WINS' Sonia Rincon) \nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) – In an address at Cooper Union Monday Morning, Mayor Bill de Blasio reaffirmed the city’s commitment to defend New Yorkers who may be the most vulnerable against some of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed policies. \n“It’s important to say out loud, there’s a lot of fear out there,” said de Blasio with two dozen city residents of every race, religion, and national origin as his back drop. \nAs WCBS 880’s Rich Lamb reports, the mayor pledged that the election was not an end, but rather a beginning, asserting that any attempt to force Muslims to register would be met with legal action by the city. \n“If the federal government wants our police officers to tear immigrant families apart, we will refuse to do it,” he said. As 1010 WINS’ Sonia Rincon reports, the mayor also said the city will refuse to implement aggressive stop-and-frisk, which would undo any progress made on police and community relations. Talk of mass deportations by the president-elect has raised concerns with the “IDNYC” program, the largest municipal ID program of its kind in the country. Some are worried that the personal records of undocumented New Yorkers may be used against them.\nAlberto Saldivia got his “IDNYC” card this year after spending 15 years in the country without legal authorization. \n“It did cause me considerable concern, because they have my information, also the information of my son,” the 53-year-old Mexican native said last week through an interpreter. \nREAD MORE: Trump Deportation Talk Raises City ID Card Concerns \nIn Monday’s address, the mayor once again vowed the city will never turn over any IDNYC records to the federal government, Lamb reports. \nThe speech was capped off with a performance of “This Land Is Your Land” by students from the Voice Charter School in Queens. \n(TM and © Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

    "text": "Veronique de Rugy November 22, 2016 1:46 PM \nLast week, fashion designer Sophie Theallet announed she would refuse to sell or donate clothes to the next first lady, Melania Trump. In an open letter, Theallet explained: \nThe Sophie Theallet brand stands against all discrimination and prejudice. . . . \nAs an immigrant myself in this country, I have been blessed with the opportunity to pursue my dreams in the USA. . . . \nAs one who celebrates and strives for diversity, individual freedom, and respect for all lifestyles, I will not participate in dressing or associating in any way with the next First Lady. \nGood for Theallet for appreciating the greatness of America — including her freedom to not sell her designs to the next first lady and to express her feelings in writing without fear of repercussions or persecutions from the government. Good for her to have immigrated to a country that allows her to sell dresses to one first lady and not to another. \nBut what about the people whose lives have been destroyed and whose reputations have been dragged through the mud by judgmental commentators or the media for refusing to bake a cake, cater food, or deliver flowers for a gay wedding? As Stephanie Slade at Reason reminds us: \nI suspect Barronelle Stutzman, the white-haired grandmother who owns Arlene’s Flowers, feels the same way about her craft. But instead of assuming a live-and-let-live attitude on the matter, Washington state has systematically worked to destroy Stutzman’s business unless she agrees to take part in a celebration to which she is morally opposed. \nAs a Pew poll shows , America is divided on the issue of whether wedding-related businesses, such as caterers and florists, should be required to serve same-sex couples who want to marry, even if the owner of these establishments objects to homosexuality for religious reasons. The real question is whether those who think the government should force the owner of a business to provide a service for a gay marriage — even though they serve gay Americans in other circumstances — will remain consistent and say that this designer isn’t entitled to her choice. \nI guess this is my chance to say that I thought Gary Johnson was absolutely wrong during the campaign to argue that the government should force a Jewish baker to bake a Nazi cake. While I agree with Johnson that there is a role for government to address a widespread refusal of service for things that are central to human flourishing — such as a business refusing to provide everyday food, medical services, or housing to a person due to race, religion, sexual orientation, or political views — it is my impression, however, that in spite of what some are claiming, there is no such widespread discrimination against gay marriages that justifies the government’s intervention. In fact, there are plenty of religious bakers who continue to cater gay weddings and make bouquets for the brides-to-be or grooms-to-be. There are also plenty of non-religious alternatives. \nNow I wonder, if a large share of designers refuse to sell clothes to one particular family or one particular first lady, when does this start to qualify as widespread discrimination? I do not have the answer to this question nor would I know what my position would be as I am always very slow to call for government intervention. But I am interested in the liberals’ position on the issue. \nFreedom of association or other freedoms covered in the First Amendment aren’t simply meant to protect you from someone else’s disapproving judgment. It is also meant to protect others from your judgment. The freedoms granted in the First Amendment are what make America so great. I have written a little about it here . Let’s hope it continues.

    "text": "10:02 PM ET Jeremy Crabtree RecruitingNation Close Jeremy Crabtree is a senior coordinator Spent 12 years with Rivals.com/Yahoo! Sports Graduated from Kansas State Follow on Twitter Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email comment The moment Texas’ recruiting rivals have been fearing has arrived.\nDespite all of his success on the recruiting trail and a top-10 finish this past February, Charlie Strong’s 2017 class had been stuck in the mud for months because prospects weren’t sure whether he would return to the sideline in Austin next season. That question has now been answered, as the University of Texas fired Strong on Saturday and announced the hiring of former Houston coach Tom Herman.\n\"If you thought H-Town Takeover was big, just wait until Tom gets to Austin,” a Big 12 assistant said. “It's going to be an entire state of Texas takeover. He's recruited at such a high level everywhere that he's been, so it's realistic to expect immediate success. You saw what he did at Houston without half the resources he will have at Texas. It's kind of scary to think how well he might do.\"\nTexas currently has seven commitments, including five ESPN 300 recruits: QB Sam Ehlinger , defensive ends Ta'quon Graham and Lagaryonn Carson , and receivers Damion Miller and Montrell Estell . As another Big 12 recruiter said when he first heard the news about Strong’s departure, the move could be the best thing to happen for the Longhorns’ recruiting effort in years.\n“I was rooting for Charlie to stick around because he’s a good guy, but also selfishly because I didn’t want to see the beast awoken again,” the Big 12 recruiter said. “We knew what we were recruiting against with Charlie Strong. With all of the uncertainly that surrounded him, it was easy for us to do damage going head-to-head against them. They weren’t going to beat anybody, but I’m afraid we’re going to get caught up in a wave of excitement that nobody will be able to stop.\n“They just hit the reset button on the all of the recruiting wars in Texas.”\nA Big Ten assistant who recruits in Texas agreed. He said few schools in the country can match what UT brings to the table from a tradition, facility, academic support and fan support standpoint. The only thing that has been missing from the Longhorns’ recruiting efforts for 2017 has been excitement, but he believes that’s going to quickly change with a new coach on board.\nThe top defensive tackle in the class, Marvin Wilson could be a big win for Herman. Erik McKinney “We’re going to get steamrolled by that momentum,” he said. “… Texas already has so many advantages over every school it recruits against, other than maybe Ohio State and Alabama. But now they’re going to have all those advantages, a fired-up fan base, and high school coaches throughout the state that will likely be willing to bend over backwards to help the new guy bring the Longhorns back to the top.\n“I told our coaches in a staff meeting on Monday, the best way to look at it, is that no commitment is safe in Texas if the Longhorns’ new coach comes knocking on their door.”\nDon’t be shocked if several of Texas’ top recruits initially rule out the Longhorns, because Strong was very popular with prospects and their families. But one SEC recruiting coordinator said even the best players will get caught up with the hype around Herman and the Horns and will eventually give Texas a strong look.\n“Experience tells me there will be a handful of top prospects that will drop Texas because of this,” the SEC coach said. “But they almost always come back around once the new guy gets into the living room. Players are drawn to a place like Texas, not just because of who the coach was, but because of so many other reasons. I wouldn’t be surprised if they pull of some shockers in late December and January.”\nThat’s where Herman comes in. The 41-year-old’s ties to the Lone Star State are extensive. He was an assistant at five different schools in the state and coached in the Big 12 at Iowa State.\nAnd Herman’s success recruiting the state has proved how much those connections matter. As an assistant at Ohio State, Herman landed Dontre Wilson and J.T. Barrett out of Texas in the 2013 class. At Houston, the #HTownTakeover energized the Cougars’ recruiting and impressed recruits. That energy helped Houston land its best-ever recruiting class, including Ed Oliver , the only five-star prospect to ever sign with a Group of 5 school.\nNow it’s up to Herman to bring all that together and unleash it in Austin.\n\"If there ever was anybody that was ready to recruit at this level and under the microscope that you're under when you're the coach at Texas, it's Tom Herman,” an SEC assistant said. “He showed me when he was in Ohio State that he was not only a very good coach, but a dynamite recruiter. He pulled some guys at Houston they had no business getting.\n\"He so charismatic and full of energy. He's going to get a lot of prospects and moms and dads fired up about the Texas program in a way that we never saw under Charlie Strong.\"\nInsider Become an insider and get access to all our articles and tools.\nSubscribe Log In View Insider Benefits Magazine subscribers: activate your Insider account.",

He gets a free ride to the White House and all we get is a lousy hat.” \nBut since Trump won the election, Romney is singing a different tune. \nRomney traveled to Trump’s golf course in New Jersey to meet with Trump last week, raising speculations that he could serve in the administration, even as a possible Secretary of State. \nWould it make sense for Mitt to apologize? \nWhat difference – at this point – does it make? \nGov. Nikki Haley didn’t issue a major public apology for going against Trump and backing Rubio and Cruz early on, and she’s likely to become the next ambassador to the UN – pending senate confirmation.

    "text": "Watch Mikaela Shiffrin, more winter sports on NBC Sports this weekend \nLindsey Vonn hopes to return to racing in January after severely fracturing the humerus bone in her right arm in a Nov. 10 training crash that was “by far the most painful injury” of her career. \nIn a recent interview with NBC Sports’ Steve Porino , Vonn said doctors at first gave her a conservative estimate of 10 to 12 weeks to return. \nThen, after strong early progress following surgery, her doctor said it could be more like eight weeks until she’s racing. \n“I normally heal pretty well, but you never know, so I’m just kind of hoping for some time in January,” Vonn said. \nThe four-time World Cup overall champion compiled a laundry list of injuries , mostly from crashes, in the last decade. \nThis one was different. Vonn is usually able to stop taking pain medication a day or two after surgery. This time, it took a week and a half. \nOn Nov. 10, Vonn lost an edge, did the splits, turned backwards, went off a little jump and landed on her arm and then into netting in Copper Mountain, Colo., weeks before her anticipated World Cup season debut. \n“I could feel my bones hitting together and hitting the nerve,” Vonn said. “It was brutal. \n“When I’m laying on the ground, I’m thinking, you’ve got to be kidding me. How do I keep doing this? I don’t know. I’ve toned down my training. I’ve tried to limit my risk as much as I can, but unfortunately it’s a high-risk sport.” \nVonn’s spirits are lifted by two goals. First, to break the World Cup career wins record of 86 held by retired Swede Ingemar Stenmark . Vonn is 10 victories shy. \nGiven she won nine races in an injury-shortened 2015-16 season, it was reasonable to think Vonn could have reached the record this year. Until that crash. \n“That’s the record that’s really getting me out of bed every day,” said Vonn, who turned 32 on Oct. 18. \nIf Vonn returns in January, she will miss at least five of the 15 scheduled World Cup races in her best events — downhill and super-G. \nNext season, Vonn will be older than any woman who has ever won an Olympic, world championships or World Cup race, except for Austrian Elisabeth Goergl , who won once at the age of 33. \n“If I couldn’t ski anymore, that would be the only thing that would prohibit me from trying to break the record,” Vonn said. “I’m so close.” \nThe second goal is the 2018 Olympics. Vonn won downhill gold in 2010 but missed the 2014 Winter Games due to injury. \n“If I didn’t have the records and the Olympics coming up, I might retire,” Vonn said, “but I still have a lot I want to accomplish, and that keeps me going.” \nVonn plans to get X-Rays every two weeks to see how the bone is healing and when she can return to snow. She has plans mapped out for best-, average- and worst-case scenarios. \nMore key races this season are the world championships in February in St. Moritz, Switzerland, and a downhill and super-G at the 2018 Olympic venue in March. Vonn has marked a date by which she is desperate to return. \n“But that’s my little secret,” she said, smiling. ",

    "text": "By John Whitesides \n(Reuters) – David Betras could see trouble coming. \nThe Democratic Party chairman in Youngstown, Ohio, wrote to Hillary Clinton’s advisers in May warning she needed to put a jobs-focused message at the heart of her White House campaign or else watch blue-collar voters in states like Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania slip away to Republican Donald Trump. \nClinton never responded to Betras, and in the final weeks of her campaign she spent much of her time portraying Trump as unfit, rather than highlighting her economic plans. On Nov. 8, Election Day, Betras’ warning proved prescient – she lost Ohio and Pennsylvania and, on Wednesday, Michigan, too, based on the latest unofficial ballot counts. \nThe surprising upset by Trump, a wealthy businessman who made his promises to renegotiate trade deals and restore jobs a centerpiece of his agenda, was fueled in part by support from white working-class voters in those vital Rust Belt states and elsewhere. \nAfter the disastrous election losses at the state and national level, Betras and other Rust Belt Democrats who have found success in blue-collar districts have some advice for their anxious party: the key to recapturing those voters is not a broad change in policy, but a new commitment to listen and act on their economic concerns, and to show Democrats care. \n“You can have all the great ideas on Earth, but if they don’t think you are on their side they aren’t going to listen to you,” said U.S. Representative Dan Kildee, of Flint, Michigan, one of a small cadre of Democrats in Congress who have learned how to win in working-class districts by emphasizing economic solutions. \nDemocratic U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright, whose district around Scranton, Pennsylvania, was one of the presidential campaign’s prime battlegrounds, also won re-election to a third term with about 54 percent of the vote. About 40,000 Trump voters crossed over to back him, he said in an interview. \n“Why would they pick me and not also Hillary Clinton? It comes down to credibility,” he said. “I know the pain out there. When I talk to voters, jobs is always my No. 1 message, and I tell them exactly what I’m doing to get more jobs back to the district.” \nRecalling the 1992 presidential campaign theme of Clinton’s husband, Bill Clinton, Cartwright added: “It’s the economy, stupid. These folks are working harder and harder to try and stay in the same place.” \nThe party’s efforts to regain lost ground with blue-collar voters could be a factor in next week’s election for Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. Tim Ryan, whose northeast Ohio district encompasses blue-collar Youngstown, is challenging veteran leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco. \nRyan has emphasized his ability to talk to working class voters and said in announcing his leadership run that people “need to know we understand that they elected us to fight for economic opportunity for all.” \nKildee, who was re-elected to a third term with 61 percent of the vote, said Democrats seeking lessons in the election rubble should not overreact and begin moderating their positions on social issues or shifting their stances to target elements of the party’s base of support. \nFrom decimated industrial towns to inner cities or the rural plains, voters share a similar anxiety about an economic system that seems to have left them behind, he said. \n“Everybody is talking about the same thing, and it’s economic uncertainty – it’s the fear of not having a job, or their kids not getting a job, or not having a retirement,” Kildee said. “If we aren’t talking about jobs and the economy first, no one is listening when you talk about other issues.” \n‘GOLD-PLATED TOILETS’ \nBy tapping into those economic worries, Trump captured about two-thirds of whites with no college degree, exit polls showed. That helped him gain the razor-thin margin of victory he needed in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – all picked up by President Barack Obama in 2012 – to win the Electoral College, despite losing the popular vote. \nIn contrast to Trump, whose rallies were a call to arms against an economic system rigged against everyday Americans, Clinton mentioned but rarely highlighted the many aspects of her economic agenda during the final weeks of the campaign. \n“We were so off message that a billionaire with gold-plated toilets was the guy who was breaking through and talking to blue-collar families,” said Betras, party chairman in Ohio’s heavily Democratic Mahoning County, where Trump captured 47 percent of the vote, 12 percentage points better than Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. \nBetras said many blue-collar workers increasingly felt forgotten by the national party, which at times seemed more focused on social and cultural issues than on bread-and-butter economic concerns. \nThe Democratic National Committee did not respond to questions about the party’s efforts to win working-class voters. \nBetras had urged Clinton in his memo to spend more time talking about ways to entice companies to repatriate manufacturing jobs, or her plans to create jobs through boosting infrastructure programs – both key elements of Trump’s stump speech. \nBoth candidates made frequent visits to Pennsylvania and Ohio. But after the party conventions in July Clinton only traveled to Michigan four times, twice in the last week of the campaign, and never visited Wisconsin. Trump hit both a half-dozen times. \nDavid Murray, a registered independent who lives just outside Flint, Michigan, said he voted to re-elect Kildee and backed Obama in 2008 and 2012, but cast his presidential ballot for Trump this time. \n“I didn’t feel like Clinton really cared about us,” said Murray, a personal service industry worker. “We are still hurting here. I feel as if we haven’t recovered from the economic free fall. Clinton seemed like just another four years of what Obama has done for my area, which is four years of nothing.” \nObama appeared to echo the concerns of Betras and the two lawmakers in recent comments on the Democratic post-election hand-wringing. \n“The key for us — when I say ‘us,’ I mean Americans, but I think particularly for progressives — is to say your concerns are real, your anxieties are real, here’s how we fix them,” Obama said. \nTrump consistently outperformed Romney’s 2012 totals in areas with heavy concentrations of working-class whites. In Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, partially in Cartwright’s district, Trump won 58 percent of the vote compared to Romney’s 47 percent. In neighboring Lackawana County, Trump won 47 percent of the vote compared to Romney’s 36 percent. \nSharon Taboada, a juvenile probation officer in Houghton Lake, Michigan, with two sons in college, said she voted for Trump in part because of his economic message. \n“Clinton talked very little about our economy and I feel she was way out of touch with the working force,” she said. \n(Reporting by John Whitesides, editing by Jason Szep and Ross Colvin) \nBlue-collar Democrats to party: It’s still the economy, stupid added by Reuters  ",

    "text": "Liverpool do not have the best of records when Adam Lallana is out Published 24/7 \nAdam Lallana has had a great start to the season for both Liverpool and England. \nHe has become one of the first names on Jurgen Klopp's teamsheet and has formed a frightening bond with attacking trio Philippe Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and summer signing Sadio Mane. \nThe former Southampton captain has scored three goals and assisted five for the Reds in the Premier League this season, as well as scoring three goals in his last three games for his country. Article continues below \nBut during the Three Lions' 2-2 friendly draw with Spain, Lallana picked up a groin injury and was forced off midway through the first half. \nIt meant he was absent for Liverpool's goalless draw at the Saints last weekend and will also miss the next two games versus Sunderland and Leeds in the EFL Cup. Article continues below WATCH: Antoine Griezmann fixes relationships with 'Hotline Bling' in hilarious Puma advert \nHe was also missing when his side drew 0-0 at home to Manchester United, in only the two games Klopp's men have failed to win in the last 11. \nAs well as the games at club level, he was also out of England's 0-0 draw against Slovenia and their abysmal 2-0 win against European minnows, Malta. LALLANA KEY? \nSo is the 28-year-old's absence and lack of goals just a coincidence, or is he genuinely the cog that keeps the goalscoring machine ticking? \nKlopp is adamant that the Reds' rare lack of goals is not down to his playmaker being out injured, but the stats suggest Liverpool miss a vital player when he is not on the field. \nThe Merseysiders have scored 17 home league goals in just five games and would be expecting to considerably add to that when they take on a resurgent Sunderland side at Anfield today. \n“Adam Lallana, as everybody knows well, is an important player but it is not about just him. The games against Man United and Southampton were completely different. You cannot compare. That is no reason for us. We don’t know if we can bring the same formation. We have got a few guys who are struggling a little bit this week and we will have to make a few late decisions,\" Klopp said, per The Guardian . DEFENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS \nDespite the lack of goals when Lallana plays, they have been much more solid defensively than in previous seasons. \nThe signing of Joel Matip on a free transfer has bolstered them massively, while the resurgence in form of Dejan Lovren has been a godsend for the Anfield faithful. \nLoris Karius has also taken the number one spot from Simon Mignolet, and they've conceded the second fewest goals at home in the league - behind leaders Chelsea - something that would have been unheard of in the last few years. \nThis year could genuinely be Liverpool's best chance of winning the title, since going so close under Brendan Rodgers in the 2013/14 season. \nCAN LIVERPOOL WIN THE LEAGUE THIS SEASON?

    "text": "Jurgen Klopp tells fans to forget about Steven Gerrard Published 24/7 \nSteven Gerrard announced his retirement from professional football on Thursday after an illustrious 18-year career. \nIt's only been two days but already people are touting Gerrard to become a coach within the game, having already met with with MK Dons about becoming their new manager. \nBut Jurgen Klopp has come out and admitted that there are impossible pressures facing today's current stars who are expected to retire from the game and immediately prove they are world-class coaches. Article continues below \nKlopp has admitted that while learning his trade at Mainz, he slipped under the radar and was able to focus on becoming as good as he could be because there was little expectation on him due to not coming off the back of a highly-publicised career. \n“In the first few years at Mainz, if I was training naked no-one would have seen it – even if I didn’t do that,” the Liverpool manager joked. Article continues below WATCH: Antoine Griezmann fixes relationships with 'Hotline Bling' in hilarious Puma advert \nAlong with Gerrard, the likes of Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville have all retired in recent years - the latter proving that this managerial lark isn't all fun and games after his troubled spell at Spanish giants Valencia. \nAnd Klopp has highlighted Patrick Vieira as the perfect example of a brilliant player that has retired, and earned his right to manage a team by experiencing management at Academy level at Manchester City. TOO MUCH PRESSURE \nHe now manages MLS side New York City and has been touted as a potential replacement for Arsene Wenger at Arsenal. \n“Maybe you can help create more English managers in England in the future if they can start working at the beginning and not in the middle or the end,” Klopp said. \n“In my career, we had no-one around and could fight for a little bit, without public interest — especially in Mainz. But I can’t change this for all of them,” he says of Gerrard. \n“In Manchester, it is the same with Giggs. 'Where will he go next?' If you want these guys on the bench, let them work and don’t handle them as the players they were before.\" FUTURE REDS MANAGER? \nHis reference comes from the fear that the likes of Gerrard will get a manager's job instantly and ultimately flop like Neville, which could lead to the experience putting off the Liverpool legend from stepping into a hot seat once more. \nIt is likely that Gerrard will look to gain his coaching badges working with the Liverpool Academy and within the England setup alongside his punditry work, over the course of the next few years. \nLiverpool fans will be hopeful that Gerrard can prove himself, and eventually end up becoming manager of the club he represented for 17 years. \nWILL WE SEE GERRARD MANAGE LIVERPOOL ONE DAY?

Premier Christy Clark brings opioid concerns to Ottawa Illicit drug deaths continue to rise in British Columbia \"Right now, there are companies in this province selling those machines and they know exactly the purpose they are being used for,\" Farnworth told On The Coast host Stephen Quinn.\n\"These businesses and these individuals are profiting from the overdose crisis. They are profiting from the deaths of people in this province.\"\nFarnworth said it was \"unacceptable\" that pill presses are still available in B.C. to anyone who can afford one.\nHe believes if the premier were to convene a fall sitting of the legislature, his bill would pass with bipartisan support.\n'No legitimate reason to have one of these machines' Alberta brought in legislation that passed unanimously . It provides for a fine of up to $50,000 fine for a first offence and up to $375,000 and one year in jail for a third offence.\nNDP MLA Mike Farnworth wants the premier to convene a fall sitting of the legislature to pass his bill. ((CBC))\nThe law, once it takes effect in January, will be the first of its kind in Canada, and Mike Ellis, the Progressive Conservative MLA behind the bill, expressed hope other provinces and the federal government would follow suit.\nFarnworth also wants federal action but says the government is wrong for not taking action in the meantime.\nHe says if B.C. were to pass a similar ban, it would empower police to hold people with such devices accountable in the province.\nAs it stands, he says, even if police find someone with a pill press, there's nothing they can do about it.\n\"Unless you're a pharmacy making pills, there's no legitimate reason to have one of these machines,\" Farnworth said. \"They are used for one purpose, and one purpose only: to manufacture illegal pills laced with fentanyl and they are a key component of the fentanyl crisis.\"\nGovernment says feds need to take action A statement from Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Morris says the government is supportive of a pill press ban in principle but national action is needed.\nB.C.

Jeff Sessions, R-Ala. speaks to media at Trump Tower in New York. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Sessions for the job of attorney general. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Credit: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) \nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is using its brand-new .gov site in part to post testimonies from black people that Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions is not a racist, despite his history of opposing civil rights advances. \nTrump last week tapped Sessions to as his attorney general pick. In a post on greatagain.gov , titled “In case you missed it . . . civil rights & law enforcement groups are strongly supporting Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general” but no civil rights group as a whole has given its explicit backing. \nLarry Thompson, the former deputy attorney general in George W. Bush’s administration, recalled sleeping in the same bed in hotel rooms with Sessions “in order to stretch our limited per diems on travel to Department of Justice conferences.” \nHe said, “You really get to know a person when you interact so closely with them,” continuing “I have been an African American for 71 years and I think I know a racist when I experience one. Jeff Sessions is simply a good and decent man.” He called Sessions a “friend” who “does not have a racist bone in his body.” \nPeter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, echoed Thompson. \n“It’s scandalous that they’re trying to say he’s a racist,” he said. “They are trying to demonize the Alabama of 2016 as somehow being the Alabama of 1946. And they are trying to similarly falsely caricature Sen. Sessions. But that is not the case.” \nLeah Durant, founder of the Black American Leadership Alliance, said Sessions “has been a leader in the fight for preserving American jobs and ensuring opportunities for African American workers.” \nThe alliance, however, is far less racially progressive than its name suggests. The organization’s platform is so staunchly anti-immigration that it received praise from Tea Party Republicans, who “sound[ed] downright giddy discussing their new partners,” according to a Daily Beast report in 2013, shortly after the group hit the scene. \n“Hate-group watchdogs have expressed concern that the organization is merely the latest in a series of minority front groups providing anti-immigration extremists cover from charges of racism,” The Daily Beast’s Michelle Cottle wrote at the time. \nSessions was denied a federal judgeship in the 1980s, after witnesses said he called a white civil rights lawyer a “disgrace to his race.” He also opposed the Voting Rights Act, which he said was “a piece of intrusive legislation.” Brendan Gauthier is assistant editor at Salon.",

Republicans have tried to reduce the scope of the bureau’s broad regulatory power since Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., one of the most liberal lawmakers in the country, oversaw its creation.\n“CFPB employees fell over each other to give money to Hillary because she supported CFPB’s desire to remain in the shadows and unaccountable to the American people,” Duffy said. “No one is shocked that Washington bureaucrats would donate to the candidate who promised to maintain and expand onerous Dodd-Frank regulations that crush our community banks and local credit unions.”\nThe bureau did not return request for comment from the  Washington Free Beacon  about the donations.\nThe CFPB was one of just four agencies in which every political contribution went to the Democratic Party or allied groups, though one of those agencies’ donations came from just one employee.\nPredictions Map See the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections.

Until now, official reintroductions have focused largely on birds of prey, though wild boar have colonised forests in southern England , after escaping from farms and parks. The beavers were reintroduced to Scotland from Norway. Rewilding Britain: bringing wolves, bears and beavers back to the land Read more \nConservationists were delighted. The Scottish Wildlife Trust said beavers created new wetlands, supporting otters, water voles and dragonflies, while helping to regulate flooding and reinvigorate woodland. \nJonathan Hughes, the SWT’s chief executive, said: “This is a major milestone for Scotland’s wildlife and the wider conservation movement. Beavers are one of the world’s best natural engineers. Their ability to create new wetlands and restore native woodland is remarkable and improves conditions for a wide range of species.” \nCunningham’s announcement was seen by zoologists and conservationists as inevitable: dozens European beavers have been illegally and stealthily released in the Highlands or have escaped from private collections over the past decade. Captive beavers have also tried to colonise parts of southern England. \nAn expensive and long-term pilot reintroduction project in Knapdale in Argyll, where three beaver families were released in 2009 under a government licence , was usurped by the rapid spread of illegally released beavers in Tayside and Perthshire. \nUp to 250 beavers are estimated to be living in the wild in rivers and lochs over several hundred square miles in the rivers Tay and Earn catchments , reaching as far north as Kinloch Rannoch and eastwards to Forfar, north of Dundee. Dozens have been persecuted and shot by landowners and farmers, angry at local flooding and tree loss. The species will be permitted to extend its range naturally. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA \nOne study found that 21 had been shot around Tayside since 2010, including two which were pregnant and two feeding young. Conservationists urged ministers to have a summer closed season for shooting amid suspicions that farmers were culling as heavily as possible before they were legally protected. \nRoisin Campbell-Palmer, conservation projects manager at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), which has funded and helped run the Knapdale project, said there was a depressing tendency to kill beavers in the area. The RZSS had had to buy “a new freezer for beaver bodies”, she said. \nCunningham’s officials and the conservation agencies involved in beaver reintroduction have since brokered a deal over the terms of the reintroduction from the National Farmers Union of Scotland and Scottish Land and Estates, which represents Highland landowners. \nWhile beavers will soon be officially designated under the EU habitats directive, land users will be able to actively manage them by cutting water channels through dams or protecting valuable trees. \nLethal culling will also be licensed by Scottish Natural Heritage in specific circumstances, the government said, if no other solution can found. Cunningham said there would be immediate action if there were any further illegal releases. \n“Today’s announcement represents a major milestone in our work to protect and enhance Scotland’s world renowned biodiversity,” she said. \n“But I want to be absolutely clear that while the species will be permitted to extend its range naturally, further unauthorised releases of beavers will be a criminal act. Swift action will be taken in such circumstances to prevent a repeat of the experience on Tayside.” \nThe RZSS chief executive, Barbara Smith, said Cunningham now had to oversee a comprehensive management plan. Officials are preparing a formal survey of Scotland’s beaver population next summer. \nSmith said further controlled releases should be considered in other parts of Scotland, despite their unofficial dispersion in the Tay area. “We also feel strongly that further release sites will need to be considered in the short- to medium-term if the species is to fully re-establish itself as part of the Scottish landscape,” she said.

When we are anxious or angry. When we feel alone. When we do not understand what is happening in the world or with our neighbors. When the news is bleak, confusing. God, we struggle to feel grateful. \nBut this Thanksgiving, we choose gratitude. \nWe choose to accept life as a gift from you, and as a gift from the unfolding work of all creation. \nWe choose to be grateful for the earth from which our food comes; for the water that gives life; and for the air we all breathe. \nWe choose to thank our ancestors, those who came before us, grateful for their stories and struggles, and we recieve their wisdom as a continuing gift for today. \nWe choose to see our families and friends with new eyes, appreciating and accepting them for who they are. We are thankful for our homes, whether humble or grand. \nWe will be grateful for our neighbors, no matter how they voted, whatever our differences, or how much we feel hurt or misunderstood by them. \nWe choose to see the whole planet as our shared commons, the stage of the future of humankind and creation. \nGod, this Thanksgiving, we do not give thanks. We choose it. We will make this choice of thanks with courageous hearts, knowing that it is humbling to say \"thank you.\" We choose to see your sacred generosity, aware that we live in an infinite circle of gratitude. That we all are guests at a hospitable table around which gifts are passed and received. We will not let anything opposed to love take over this table. Instead, we choose grace, free and unmerited love, the giftedness of life everywhere. In this choosing, and in the making, we will pass gratitude onto the world. \nThus, with you, and with all those gathered at this table, we pledge to make thanks. We ask you to strengthen us in this resolve. Here, now, and into the future. Around our family table. Around the table of our nation. Around the table of the earth. \nWe choose thanks.

Photo Laurie Skrivan, lskivan@post-dispatch.com By Kristen Taketa St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nSuperintendent Scott Spurgeon makes a presentation about improvements in the Riverview Gardens School District at a public hearing on Thursday, May 5, 2016, at Westview Middle School. Photo by Kristen Taketa \nMissouri's education department is recommending that the Riverview Gardens School District regain provisional accreditation because it has shown years of stable leadership and sustained progress. \nThe change, if approved by the state board of education on Dec. 2, would cut off the migration of hundreds of transfer students and millions of dollars the district pays for those students to attend accredited schools elsewhere. \n“There has been a significant shift in the climate and culture of that district,” said Missouri Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven Tuesday. \nHowever, the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is holding off on a recommendation to upgrade the provisionally accredited St. Louis Public Schools until January. \nIt was revealed last month that Riverview , which has been unaccredited by the state since 2007, scored high enough in the state's annual school report cards to be considered fully accredited for the second year in a row. \nThe district still has a ways to go in improving academic performance. Only about 25 percent of student test-takers passed state tests for English, and 14 percent did so for math this year. \n“We're certainly aware that there is still much improvement to be made,” Vandeven said. \nBut she said that Riverview's leadership is stable and has been working hard to improve the district. \n“We're very excited about that,” said Riverview Gardens Superintendent Scott Spurgeon of the recommendation. “This is the first time we've heard those words in three years.” \nSpurgeon, who took the helm of the district in 2013, has been obsessed with regaining accreditation. \nHe can recite the progress of his district point by point, category by category. He measures improvements in every additional Advanced Placement test passed and every library book checked out by a student. Even elementary school students know what state accreditation means. \n“It really solidifies the great work and the accomplishments that we've been able to achieve over the last three years, now four years,” Spurgeon said of the recommendation. “It keeps that candle burning in our district of hope.” \nThe state board of education will vote on whether to give the district an accreditation upgrade at its Dec. 2 meeting in Kansas City. \nIf the district receives that upgrade, the state transfer law that allows hundreds of Riverview students to attend schools in accredited districts on Riverview's dime will no longer apply. \nVandeven did not recommend an effective date for Riverview's upgrade. The board could decide to make a Riverview upgrade effective the day of the December board meeting, Jan. 1 of next year, or the end of this school year. \nPostponing the effective date would allow Riverview transfer students to continue attending their transfer schools for longer. \nBut some receiving districts have already been working with Spurgeon to adopt a plan that would allow current transfer students to stay in that district for up to four more years, or until they come to a natural transition point. \nFor instance, that means middle school students would be able to attend until they finish eighth grade, and high school students would stay at their school until they graduate. The student would just need to maintain residence in the district boundaries and remain in good standing with the transfer school. \n“We felt it was the right and responsible thing to do to provide a transitional period,” Spurgeon said. \nDistricts that adopt this plan would also agree to charge Riverview just $7,000 a student each year for tuition, which is less than what several districts currently charge Riverview. Riverview would also not have to provide transportation or transportation funding for transfer students starting next school year. \nWebster Groves and Kirkwood have agreed to this plan. \nAs for St. Louis Public Schools, which is provisionally accredited, the state education department is giving no recommendation for an upgrade. \nInstead, the department wants the district to come to the state board’s meeting in January to discuss its accreditation status. A possible vote on the district's status could happen at that meeting. \nThe district scored in the fully accredited range last year, but it scored just barely out of the fully accredited range this year. \n“We're certainly pleased that the state board will be discussing the district at their meeting in January,” said Patrick Wallace, district spokesman. “The district certainly realizes that that's a DESE and state board decision, and we respect that decision.” \n​Kristen Taketa",

    "text": "WATCH Donald Trump Leaves Press Behind for Dinner With Family 0 Shares Email Since winning the election, President-elect Donald Trump has broken with tradition and traveled twice without his protective press pool. On one of them, he made waves by going to a Manhattan steakhouse without members of the media. Why is this a topic of discussion and what does it signal for reporting on the next president? Definition of a Protective Press Pool Jim Cole/AP Photo Donald Trump talks with reporters as he arrives to speak at a No Labels Problem Solver convention, Oct. 12, 2015, in Manchester, New Hampshire. A \"protective press pool\" is a group of journalists that travels wherever the president goes, reporting on behalf of a broader group of reporters; it is a press corps that's always meant to be with the president -- protectively, as its name suggests. The pool typically includes two print reporters, one TV producer, one radio reporter, three wire service reporters, a cameraman and a few photographers. Journalists on pool duty report on a rotating basis and they share their notes with other members of the wider pool. For example, a TV producer from ABC News who is in the pool for that day will send reporting and footage to all five TV networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and Fox News). Over the course of this election's primaries, only a handful of events on the campaign trail were pooled (retail stops at diners in New Hampshire, for instance). Once the two major party nominees emerged, a protective pool was set up to ensure Americans would have reports on the campaign happenings of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton . Why It Was Created? Because of space concerns or security reasons, not all reporters wishing to cover the president may always be able to do so. Covering the president at all times might also be too costly for some news organizations. According to the late White House reporter and author Helen Thomas in her book \" Watchdogs of Democracy? The Waning Washington Press Corp and How It Has Failed the Public (2006),\" the press pool was created under President Dwight Eisenhower , by White House press secretary James Hagerty. What is the point of the pool? Universal History Archive/Getty Images Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson takes the oath of office to become the 36th President of the United States as he is sworn in on Air Force One after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. The protective pool has played a crucial role over the course of history. When John Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, members of the protective pool had been traveling with the president and were able to quickly report on the situation. The protective pool also witnessed the 1981 assassination attempt of Ronald Reagan . And on 9/11, the protective pool with George W. Bush was able to report on how the president was reacting and the measures taken to keep him safe. 0 Shares",

    "text": "T he most interesting question about 2016 is not why the Brexit result and Trump happened, but whether historians will regard both as incidental; whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet – in which reality , already engaged in a life-or-death struggle with inverted commas, finally gave way to “alt-reality”.\nThe results of these votes were shocking, but not surprising. The rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry. No mystery there. In the past week, however, the collective postmortem – on the left and right of politics – has focused on a concern with far greater long-term impact: the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media . Many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed Trump ; Democrats had paid and bussed anti-Trump protesters ; Hillary Clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor. About the only accusation not levelled at Clinton was implication in the murder of JFK, and that was because Trump had already used it against his Republican primary rival Ted Cruz . If democracy is predicated on reliable information, it’s in serious trouble right now.\nFacebook’s failure: did fake news and polarized politics get Trump elected? Read more \nVery few people saw this coming. Back in the 1990s, at the height of the dotcom boom, the internet pioneer Josh Harris tried to sound a warning – but at that early utopian stage, when the web was assumed to be decentralising, democratising, enlightening, almost no one understood what he was saying. Later, in 2002, George W Bush’s own Voldemort, his deputy chief of staff Karl Rove , chided a reporter by saying: “People like you are in what we call the reality-based community . You believe that solutions emerge from judicious study of the discernible reality. That’s not the way the world really works any more.” The gnomic taunt caused more bemusement than consternation at the time, but Rove was ahead of the game.\nHow did we get here – and was/is this situation inevitable? Much has been written about the arrival of a “ post-truth ” era, in which facts become secondary to feeling; expertise and vision to ersatz emotional connection. Nazi Germany shows that this is not new, but the internet-driven efficiency with which it can be manipulated is.\nAlso new and specifically net-enabled is something I call “retro-truth”, which marks a deep existential and ethical shift for humanity, in which a proposition is judged not by whether it is true or false when stated, but whether it has the potential to become true – whether it contains the possibility of truth, like energy waiting to be released from an atom. Both developments stem from the speed and stealth with which information now travels and they challenge society’s most fundamental ethical underpinnings. In their shadow, traditional notions of truth and falsity merge into each other, allowing anything to be said with impunity.\nThere’s a technocratic side to the information problem as well. At the Miami book fair last week I met Cathy O’Neil , author of Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy. O’Neil was a teen maths prodigy-turned-professor who left academia for a hedge fund before realising post-2008 that “mathematics, once my refuge, was not only deeply entangled in the world’s problems, but also fuelling them”.\nBursting the Facebook bubble: we asked voters on the left and right to swap feeds Read more \nO’Neil’s book describes the malign effects of the “opaque, unquestioned, unaccountable” algorithms – known as algos – that began in finance but now mediate every aspect of our lives, including what we see in our Facebook news feeds . Her overarching message is that nothing about these algorithms is neutral, with editorial decisions unavoidably written into the software despite being presented as automated and therefore objective. “There’s always a measure of success for any algorithm,” she told me, “and the general rule is that if you don’t know what that is, it’s probably profit.” Algos also punish the poor, she argues, because the rich tend to have their affairs managed by people rather than cheap monolithic software.\nBack in July, post-Brexit vote, this paper’s editor, Katharine Viner, detailed the ways in which net organisations such as Facebook and Google have undermined traditional journalism . One of the main drivers of this process is a click-based revenue model, in which algorithms prioritise items in news feeds based on how likely individual users are to “engage with” (ie click on) them – and thus be exposed to more ads. Whether these items contain carefully researched or fabricated material is of no concern to the algos: in fact, false, sensationalist stories that bolster existing prejudices are more likely to draw clicks than sober analyses that challenge assumption. With misinformation being incentivised in this way, who could be surprised when Buzzfeed found a group of young Macedonians copying the most outlandish fabrications to more than 140 specially created pro-Trump websites and sexing up the headlines to gain clicks and go viral on Facebook?\n\n  ‘Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been resistant to the notion that his company, social media, or the web in general are undermining democracy.’ Photograph: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images \nThis is important, because a recent study by the Pew Research Centre found a majority of American adults using Facebook as a source of news (which means Britain is sure to follow). Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been resistant to the notion that his company, social media, or the web in general are undermining democracy (“ a pretty crazy idea ”), even after dozens of his own staff formed a covert taskforce to address the problem post-election. It’s easy to see why he bridles too, because if he accepts the truth that his algorithms function no more objectively than a human editor, then he bears responsibility for their choices. And once he does that, he allows the equally obvious truth that Facebook, whether it wants to be or not, is now a media organisation and must vouch for the information it disseminates.\nIn the new robopolitics, social media has left newspapers for dead | Damian Tambini Read more \nAmong the most pernicious myths of our time is that the functioning of the web is neutral and immutable; that it has evolved of its own ethereal logic, like a galaxy, and can’t be changed or stopped. The web we have is one of many we might have had – indeed, when Tim Berners-Lee released its protocols in the early 1990s, some seasoned net-heads were appalled by its primitive mimicry of paper, lack of deference to copyright and so on.\nWhat can be done? O’Neil champions the idea of a Hippocratic oath for the “quants”, people who create and nurture algorithms, and of regular algorithmic audits to assess their effects. More fundamentally, it would be easy for us to decide as a society and legislate accordingly that Facebook et al should be treated as media organisations , and held accountable for the information from which they profit. And it’s important that we act now, because the same truth trolls who disgraced the US election are turning their fire on the socially minded entrepreneur Elon Musk , perhaps fearful that he might go into politics – and rest assured that it won’t end there.\nOne day, I suspect, we will look back in disbelief that we let the net-induced friction on civil society reach this pitch, because if we didn’t know before, we know now that our stark choice is between social networks’ bottom line and democracy. I know which I prefer. Or will we let the algos decide?",

England and Scotland likely to challenge Fifa on poppy disciplinary action Read more \nFifa on Wednesday opened disciplinary proceedings against Wales and Northern Ireland in relation to their acts of remembrance at World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Azerbaijan respectively. Both the FAW and the Irish Football Association have vowed to contest the charges they face. \nBut the FAW has gone further by detailing the incidents Fifa has confirmed it is investigating, which include the fact of “some supporters in the stands wearing the poppy”. \nFifa’s tough stance on the poppy, as part of its Rule 4.4 concerning political, religious or commercial messages, caused a furore in the buildup to and over Armistice weekend. \nEngland and Scotland defied the governing body in their World Cup qualifier at Wembley by wearing the symbol on their black armbands and are also facing disciplinary action. \nWales and Northern Ireland obeyed Fifa’s ruling and wore plain black armbands, but still marked the occasion in other ways including the laying of wreaths and poppy mosaics in the crowd. \nAs well as fans wearing poppies, the FAW said Fifa is also investigating the fact that: “A member of the armed forces was holding a bunch of poppies at the exit of the tunnel. \n“A fans’ mosaic depicting the poppy was displayed during the anthem of Wales. A banner depicting the poppy was also displayed by the supporters of Wales before the match started.” \nIn a statement, the FAW chief executive, Jonathan Ford, said: “Naturally as an association we are disappointed and surprised at the news. Our intention was to show respect on Armistice weekend which we feel we did in the right and proper way. \n“We also adhered to the rules and regulations of the competition and the communication from Fifa prohibiting the FAW request for the players to wear the poppy symbol on the armbands or the field of play. \n“We are particularly disappointed that one of the charges relates to supporters in the stands wearing poppies. Naturally as an association we will strongly contest the charges.” \nLikewise, Northern Ireland have defended their acts of remembrance. \nAn Irish FA spokesman said: “The Irish Football Association will robustly defend the disciplinary charges that have been levelled against it by Fifa regarding acts of remembrance at the World Cup qualifying match between Northern Ireland and Azerbaijan on November 11.” \nPrior to the Wembley match, England and Scotland both said they were confident they would be able to successfully appeal against any punishment, particularly as they believe a clear precedent was set in 2011 when England, Scotland and Wales were allowed to wear armbands with poppies on them during three November friendlies. \nThe new regime at Fifa, which is led by president Gianni Infantino and general secretary Fatma Samoura, views this very differently, however, and is determined to enforce the letter of the law when it comes to keeping what it sees as external distractions and potentially inflammatory messages out of the game. \nAll four nations now face the possibility of a fine, while in theory even a World Cup qualifying points deduction is possible. \nIn announcing the disciplinary case, a Fifa spokesperson said: “The disciplinary committee decided to open proceedings against the Irish Football Association and the Football Association of Wales in relation to several incidents involving the display of poppy symbols reported after the matches Northern Ireland-Azerbaijan and Wales-Serbia respectively.” ",

    "text": "For first time in public speech, education minister calls for Palestinian \"land-port\" at JPost conference. Naftali Bennett. (photo credit:MARC ISRAEL SELLEM) Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could prevent the creation of a Palestinian state by ruling it out in his first meeting with US President-elect Donald Trump when he takes office, Bayit Yehudi leader Naftali Bennett said Wednesday at The Jerusalem Post Conference at the capital's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.Bennett came to the conference directly from New York, where he met with Trump advisers, which angered Netanyahu. The prime minister issued a warning to his ministers to leave Trump to him, but the warning came after the meetings had already taken place. Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. On the sidelines of the conference, Bennett declined to reveal which Trump advisers he met with and whether Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was one of them. \"The next few weeks present a unique window of opportunity for Israel,\" Bennett told the crowd. \"Since 1967 there have always been external reasons for Israel to not do what is right for itself. When Prime Minister Netanyahu meets President Trump, what will he say? Will he continue the long standing approach of forming a Palestinian state in the heart of Israel or take a new, fresh approach?\"Bennett said he was eagerly awaiting the answer from Netanyahu when it comes.\"I want to hear what we want for ourselves,\" he said. \"Israel was put in a unique position to say what it wants. Do we want a second Palestinian state in addition to Gaza that would inevitably be hostile and fail?\"Addressing a crowd of dozens of diplomats, Bennett said previously believed axioms about the Middle East had been disproven in recent years, including that settlements are an obstacle to peace and that it is necessary to stay away from Israel to build ties with Arab countries.\"Today everyone knows that what is happening in Mosul has nothing to do with another house being built in Ofra,\" he said. \"The thought that countries could find favor with the Arab world by distancing itself from Israel has been disproved.\"Bennett said he hoped Trump keeps his promise and that his administration would be the first that acknowledges Jerusalem as Israel's united capital. He criticized Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman for calling for building only in settlement blocs , saying that \"loose chatter and concessions without being asked\" harms Israel. \"No American administration will be more hawkish to Israel than Israel,\" he said. \"We have one chance - to go by failed path or try something new.\"Regarding what to do with the Palestinians instead of forming a state, he said Israel should take steps to improve the Palestinians' quality of life, such as giving them full freedom of movement, tourism projects, and helping the Palestinians reach jobs in Israel easier. For the first time in a public speech, Bennett called for the creation of a \"land-port\" to help Palestinians enter Israel.\"We should seek to manage the conflict in a reasonable way,\" he said. \"We can't create them a state, but let's see what we can do. We can give them a Marshall plan to boost their economy and an autonomy on steroids.\" Relevant to your professional network? Please share on Linkedin Think others should know about this?

On being asked how his wedding would be, Ranveer said, “It would be a non-stop party. I want everyone to have a blast. I want to have it on an island if I can afford.

    "text": "Map: France \nNearly a third of the child asylum seekers being tracked by a refugee charity have gone missing since the \"Jungle\" migrant camp in the French city of Calais was dismantled last month, the organisation says. \nRefugee Youth Service said it could not locate a third of the 179 children it had been tracking since authorities bulldozed the camp, home to up to 10,000 people fleeing war or poverty in the Middle East and Africa. \nThe fate of children staying in the camp, which housed migrants who were hoping to make it across to Britain, has been a political problem for the UK Government. \nReligious leaders, refugee rights campaign groups and opposition parties have accused the Government of dragging its heels in helping to deal with unaccompanied children. \nRefugee Youth Service, which has worked in the Calais camp since November last year, said a lack of information and widespread misunderstanding about what would happen to them had led to many children disappearing. \n\"These are some of the most vulnerable children in the world, they have been let down time and time again,\" the charity's co-founder Ben Teuten said in a statement. \n\"When they disappear we are extremely concerned that they will be preyed upon by traffickers, and are unlikely to seek state support due to their treatment to date.\" As the Calais \"Jungle\" ends in flames, 8,000 asylum seekers face more uncertainty in France. \nEarlier this month French authorities began moving about 1,500 unaccompanied children from the Jungle to reception camps across the country. \nJosie Naughton, who helped to set up another charity, Help Refugees, said many asylum seeker children were frightened. \n\"Being placed somewhere that you don't understand - where you don't necessarily have access to translators or social workers - and not knowing how long you'll be there, that triggers a natural instinct to take control of your own life,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \nAsylum seeker children have two legal routes into Britain. One is under European Union rules that allow for children to be reunited with relatives already in the UK. \nThe other is under the so-called Dubs amendment to the Immigration Act, which allows the most at-risk child refugees in Italy, Greece and France to be taken to the UK for sanctuary. \nRefugee Youth Service called on the French and British governments to provide clearer information to child migrants, and urged the authorities to report children as missing when they disappear from reception centres. \nFrench and British officials were not immediately available for comment. \nReuters First posted November 24, 2016 13:12:43 Europe migrant crisis",

    "text": "Map: Darwin 0800 \nAlmost 2,000 children have been abused or neglected in just one year in the Northern Territory, and Territory Families failed to protect almost a quarter of them from more abuse, a new report has revealed. \nThe NT children's commissioner has released her annual report, finding that the number of notifications potential harm to children has more than doubled in the past five years. \nLast year alone, there was a 20 per cent spike in reports, with 20,465 notifications received by the department for 10,851 children, or almost two reports per child. \nAlmost half of all notifications related to neglect, and almost of third of cases related to emotional abuse. \nAlmost a fifth of cases involved physical abuse, and sexual exploitation notifications made up just under 10 per cent of the total, a slight decrease from the previous year. \nChildren's commissioner Colleen Gwynne said the 20 per cent increase in notifications of potential harm to children from the previous year proved authorities had not yet gotten it right and needed to find another approach. \n\"We have got a real breakdown in our system: more kids are finding themselves the subject of a report and more kids are ending up in care,\" she said. \nAccording to the report, 1,794 children last financial year were found to have been abused, with 403 children harmed again within 12 months. \n70 children were abused while in out-of-home care, including by foster carers who undergo a screening process by the department, and 10 children in care were abused multiple times. \n\"This means that although Territory Families had recognised that abuse or neglect had occurred, the response of the agency was not sufficient to ensure the safety of the child,\" the report reads. \n\"It remains of continued concern that such a high percentage of children are being re-exposed to risk following previously substantiated abuse or neglect.\" Photo: Indigenous children are still extremely over-represented in the NT's child protection system. (ABC News: James Dunlevie) \nMinister for Families Dale Wakefield said the Government needed to make sure its quality control systems were as strong as possible. \n\"I don't think any child abuse is acceptable but particularly where the department is involved,\" she said, adding that the system would require \"significant\" reform. \nThere has also been a 12 per cent decrease in the number of reports of abuse being substantiated, despite an increase in the overall number of reports made, Ms Gwynne said. \n\"We are getting an increase in notifications, but once they are examined then there's a decrease in those that are substantiated, [where] further investigation is undertaken,\" she said. \n\"What is happening to those matters? I think we need to have a good microscope on that issue in itself.\" Majority of children in out-of-home care Aboriginal \nAlmost four-fifths of reports of abuse or harm to children in the NT related to Indigenous children, the report found. \nMs Gwynne said they Indigenous children were still over-represented in the system. \nBut she said although neglect made up the majority of reports, that meant authorities could do something about it. \n\"We can look at early intervention strategies and family support, diverting families from the statutory system,\" she said, noting that the situation could be fixed. \n\"It's not a quick fix, but if we start changing the way that we respond to those really early signs within families, then you know we are going to see a decrease of these over-representations of neglect that we currently see in the NT.\" \nIt remains crucial to divert at-risk children away from the youth justice system, Ms Gwynne said. \n\"We are not using those pre-court, pre-offending strategies that will work and stop kids from entering into child protection and the youth justice system,\" she said. \n\"What we are seeing now is just continual increases in this area and no system, [no matter] how good or how well-staffed or financed it is, is going to be able to withstand the continual increase that we are seeing at the moment.\"",

    "text": "Foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong Employer retrieves domestic helper’s passport from agency, calls for government crackdown on illegal fees \nCase illustrates common situation where documents such as passports and contracts are withheld to compel helpers to pay excessive amounts to agencies   2:54pm   2:54pm Migrant charity offers lifeline to Hong Kong’s domestic helpers 21 Nov 2016 \nAn Australian man living in Hong Kong was planning a trip to Japan when he encountered an unexpected problem. His family wanted to take their helper with them, but there was something missing: her passport. \nWhat Mr Smith – who prefers not to reveal his real name due safety concerns – did not know at the time was that the helper had been forced to sign a contract in which she agreed that her agency would keep her passport until she paid them HK$5,000. \nShe had three months do so – if she took more time, the agency would start charging interest. \nSmith, 38, who approached the agent and managed to recover his helper’s passport as well as the money she had already paid, is now calling on the government to offer better protection to helpers and to crack down on agencies that charge illegal fees. \nIllegal fees, little rest and no documents: domestic helpers in Hong Kong continue to fight for their rights \n“I know that my helper is not the only one in this situation ... I saw a box full of passports when I went there and insisted on recovering her documents,” Smith said. \n“The system needs reform ... It’s so unfair that vulnerable people – like domestic helpers – are being taken advantage of.” \nSmith’s helper, who is from the Philippines, said that after she got her documents and money back, she started receiving calls from the agency. \n“They were very angry at me, asking me why I had spoken to my employer,” she recalled. \nHer story illustrates a point highlighted in a report released last month: “Indebtedness due to excessive agency fees is a pivotal issue in terms of explaining why migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong remain vulnerable to human and labour rights abuses.” \nThe study , titled “Between a Rock and a Hard Place”, noted that domestic helpers were charged illegal fees in the Philippines, and when they arrived in the city they had to pay an average of HK$11,320 in further fees to placement agencies – the equivalent of more than 25 times the legally permitted maximum charge. \nOf the 67 interviewees in the study, about a third had had their passport and/or employment contract confiscated by their placement agency or employer in Hong Kong, the investigation showed. The report was a collaborative effort by several unions and human rights organisations. \nDolores Balladares, spokeswoman for the Asian Migrants Coordinating Body, noted that the passport should be held by the employee and not by agencies or employers. \nSmith said that his family had considered making a police report. \n“But we were concerned about the safety of our children ... We don’t know whether the agency is connected to some sort of organised crime,” he said. \n“Also, we felt that would not have much impact ... The fines agencies have to pay are quite low, and the Employment Agencies Administration seems to be a bit toothless.” \nThe Labour Department conducted 5,233 inspections between January 2014 and September this year. Only 13 agencies had their licenses revoked, while 23 were fined between HK$1,500 and HK$45,000. \nIn an earlier response to the Post , a spokesman for the department said that a code of conduct for agencies would soon be introduced. The code, he noted, would “specify that employment agencies should not keep any personal property, including identification documents of foreign domestic helpers (e.g. passports), or they may be held liable for an offence”. \nCritics have, however, have expressed doubt over the effectiveness of the document in cracking down on malpractice by agencies and better protecting the 345,000 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong. \n“I am from a country where to have a helper is not common at all ... so we do appreciate the contribution that she makes to our family ... They should be given the chance to spend their money the way they find fit, instead of being forced to pay illegal fees,” Smith said.",

Tata also lauded Modi’s recent focus on the digital modes of payments instead of paper currencies, and claimed that the use of e-transaction will ‘enormously benefit’ the common, underprevileged and the poor, in a long run.\nCiting the increase in the circulation of blackmoney in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, had initiated the demonetisation policy, following which there had been an ban on currency notes of the denomination Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. With the implementation of the anti-graft policy by the center, there had been a chaotic situation among the common people in the country, with people desperately trying to replace their cash notes with the usable paper currencies from the banks and ATMs. And even as the policy completed two weeks of implementation, cash-starved people are seen standing in long queues, waiting for hours, outside the money-machines.\nAs the lack of usable cash hit the market, the use of digital payment system, saw a rapid rise among the common people of the country. E-wallet firms like Paytm,Mobiwik and Freecharge witnessed steep increase in their usage with people from unorganized sectors to street vendors using their e-transaction facilities, thereby initiating the formal use of cashless economy in India.",

    "text": "AMC’s The Walking Dead has an uncanny knack for manipulating its audience, but this year’s hyper-violent season premiere went too far. So far that we canceled our ongoing series The Walking Dead Quitter’s Club, and co-author Bryan Bishop swore off the show entirely. \nNow, Nick Statt is trying to change his mind. Instead of tearing the show down, he’ll be finding something to highlight. It might be a subtle change in character, a great action scene, or a new development in a narrative arc. But every week, he’ll be seeking out things that remind us of the very best of The Walking Dead — the moments that might just give viewers a reason to come back. \nWelcome to The Walking Dead Redemption Club. \nDear Bryan,\nI think it’s safe to say that keeping up with The Walking Dead has not been easy these last few episodes. We’re just two weeks away from the mid-season finale, and while the chessboard has been rearranged quite a bit, it feels like none of the pieces have really advanced. Instead, the show has just kept piling on more elements. We’ve seen TWD ’s universe expand this season more than it ever has before, with new communities, characters, and storylines laid out in a Game of Thrones -style sprawl. \nUnlike that show’s deft interweaving of narrative threads, however, T he Walking Dead likes to spend entire episodes focused on a single storyline, leaving main characters sputtering in place and viewers hungry for action. In tonight’s episode, “Swear,” we get another standalone tale starring Tara, another new community, and another break from whatever ultimate showdown this slow burn of a season has been building toward. \nIt’s certainly refreshing to see a show spotlight its less popular characters with actual airtime instead of offscreen business we hear about after the fact. But I’m just hoping all this setup ultimately pays off. You and I both know from experience that where there’s anticipation, there’s the potential for disappointment — and TWD doesn't have a good track record when it comes to delivering. Count my fingers crossed for now. \nGene Page / AMC Hey, who remembers Tara and Heath? The last time we saw Tara and Heath was months ago in season six, before the demise of Tara’s girlfriend Denise, and when Heath was still that random secondary character whose name you’d tend to forget. Tara is still the quip-loving source of comic relief the show deploys in hit-or-miss fashion, and Heath is still… that guy whose name you tend to forget. So you’d be forgiven for not remembering exactly where they went off to. \nYou’d be forgiven for forgetting where Tara and Heath went off to last season It turns out they were sent on a supplies run before The Saviors took over Alexandria. Instead of hitting viewers over the head with this information, TWD uses a clever sequence of scenes out of chronological order to set up Tara’s circumstance, starting first with her washing up on a beach. She’s discovered by a unnervingly violent young girl that loves stabbing walkers in the head, and her more compassionate adult supervisor Cindy, who’s convinced Tara should be spared. \nFrom there, we jump back to Tara and Heath’s desperate attempt to gather supplies on a bridge full of derelict construction equipment. Fate has it one such piece of equipment is carrying an entire truck bed of zombie-infested sand, which comes crashing down on the two survivors and forces Tara into the river. She wakes after washing ashore and follows Cindy to a village in the woods. The setup may be a way to milk 20 or so more minutes out of an otherwise straightforward plot line, but it helps build the tension for when Tara stumbles on a strange sight. \nGene Page / AMC A world without men At this point, it’s pretty difficult to make viewers care about yet another new community in the post-apocalyptic Virginia countryside. But TWD , having used a tiger and a man named Jesus to spruce up its standalone threads, pulls out yet another trick to turn Tara’s excursion into a world-building exercise. This time around, it’s a village where little girls are trained to kill on sight, and there’s not a single man or boy to be found. \nGene Page / AMC “Swear” gets about halfway in before Tara asks the question the audience is desperate to see answered. She’s just been shot at by a well-armed militia of women who’re convinced that any being, living or undead, is a threat to the safety of their community. She convinces her captors that that she’s harmless and may in fact be able to establish a mutual partnership with Alexandria, and then Tara asks the big question: where are all the men? She gets a vague answer at first. \nThe real truth is revealed later, the information used in calculating fashion to make the revelation hit the audience as hard as it hits Tara. After convincing the matriarchal leader of the village to let her lead a convoy back to Alexandria, Tara finds herself running from two renegade women intent on keeping their home a well-kept secret, even if it means defying orders and killing the visitor who might lead the Saviors back. \nTara doesn’t manage to get too far before she’s caught at gunpoint by one of the women, who conveniently explains that the threat that drove them into the woods was in fact The Saviors. All the men in the village — and any boy older than 10 — were killed by Negan’s men to prevent an uprising, forcing the remaining survivors to seek refuge in the forest. When Tara tries to convince her captor that Alexandria took The Saviors out — remember that attack on the satellite station last season, when Glenn notched his first human kill? — Tara learns the truth. Negan’s army is far larger, and Rick’s plan to end the threat must have actually sparked a war. \nA moment for Denise and a lesson learned Because of some last-minute intervention from Cindy, one of the few members of the all-women community capable of trusting outsiders, Tara manages to escape execution and make her way back to Alexandria. She’s met by Eugene, whose heartbroken expression makes it clear that he’s been dreading the moment he’d have to break the news of Denise’s death. \nThe show doesn’t spend too much time on Tara’s mourning — probably a good move, given her character’s upbeat attitude. Instead, we have Tara reconsidering what it means to take a human life, and whether the world has truly been reduced to a savage Darwinian power struggle. Perhaps there’s a better way, and the village in the forest is an example to both her and the audience of what it looks like when a group refuses to respond in violent kind and simply hides itself from the world, instead. We see this change of heart most evidently when Rosita questions Tara about any firearms they could acquire to fight back against The Saviors. The village had a huge weapons cache, but Tara doesn’t mention it. Maybe violence isn’t the answer, when all it does it beget more violence — and more loved ones dead. \nGene Page / AMC Road to Redemption On one hand, it’s easy to get fed up with how The Walking Dead has treated this season. We’ve seen numerous separate storylines teased out with no clear endgame in sight or mounting conflict between Negan and Rick, the supposed main character of the show who’s spent maybe 30 minutes on-screen over the last six hours of television. On the other hand, it’s becoming more obvious how the show’s architects plan to combine everything into one cohesive whole. \nThe big revenge plot we’ve been expecting might take a different form As much as showrunner Scott Gimple likes to meander, it’s clear these spotlighted communities are a part of a potential network that could lead to the rebuilding of society. If Negan were killed and The Saviors disbanded, we could see all these groups merge into one, perhaps with a trade network and true, lasting peace. If there’s one thing Tara’s story in “Swear” drives home, it’s that the big revenge plot we’ve been expecting might take a different form. Maybe Rick and the Alexandria crew won’t have to become as brutal and unforgiving as Negan to free themselves from The Saviors. \nPerhaps all they need is more men — and a village full of women — to stand up and refuse to be subjugated. That doesn’t mean it won’t be violent; I doubt Glenn and Abraham will be the last characters to meet their end by way of a barbed wire baseball bat. But it gives The Walking Dead a rare opportunity to break from its habit of squeezing drama out of its characters’ crises of conscience. If every character we’ve seen thus far joins together to fight Negan, it would mark the most valiant effort these survivors have mustered in all the years they’ve spent wandering the wasteland. That sounds like something every viewer could get behind. \n-Nick",

    "text": "REGINA - Premier Brad Wall says he would like to make everyone in Saskatchewan an automatic organ donor unless they opt out.\nWall said he wants to bring in a system of presumed consent for organ donation and the government is looking at what steps could be taken to protect such legislation from being legally challenged.\n\"My personal view is, if it's possible to have presumed consent that's consistent with the rights of Canadians and the Constitution, I think that would be a great thing to lead the country in,\" Wall said Tuesday at the legislature in Regina.\nThe Canadian Transplant Society said no other province has presumed consent.\nSociety president James Breckenridge said if Saskatchewan makes the decision, its policy must be carefully worded. Breckenridge said currently when someone dies, the person's spouse has the legal power to override an organ donation consent agreement.\n\"Right now we don't have any presumed consent in Canada,\" he said from Toronto.\n\"If the policy is 100 per cent carved in stone where nobody can change that donor (from) becoming a donor, organ donations would go way up.\"\nRight now in Canada there is about a 10 per cent gap between the demand and supply of donor organs, Breckenridge said.\nSaskatchewan's donation rate is low compared with the rest of Canada - less than one per cent of people who die in the province donate any organ or tissue.\nA legislative committee was tasked with looking at ways to boost what Wall has called Saskatchewan's \"dubious record\" on organ donations.\nSupporters of presumed consent told the committee it takes the burden off a grieving family to decide whether their loved one wanted to donate their organs, and it would also take the burden off health-care professionals to approach a family to gain consent.\nBut several organizations raised concerns that presumed consent may create fear and mistrust with the public.\nThe committee report tabled Monday makes 10 recommendations.\nOne recommendation calls for public education and awareness campaigns aimed at increasing knowledge about the importance of organ and tissue donation. A second idea suggests educational programs to help health care professionals identify potential donors and how to approach the family to gain consent for organ and tissue donation.\nBut the committee stops short of recommending presumed consent. It says implementation of such a system would likely be challenged in the courts.\nIt recommends the continued use of an enhanced opt-in system of consent for organ and tissue donation and the creation of an intent-to-donate registry.\nWall wants to go further because he said organ donation \"fundamentally saves lives.\"\n\"We know that we have to do better in Saskatchewan,\" he said.\n\"We know this saves lives and so we're looking carefully at whether or not there are some things we can do from a legal standpoint to protect ... any legislative move to have presumed consent, to be part of the reality in Saskatchewan.\"\n- With files from John Cotter in Edmonton \nRelated Stories Teen killed in crash 'saving 45 lives' after signing donor form days earlier Mother uncovers lasting impact of son's organ donation Organ donations rise in Canada, by 23 per cent over the last decade",

Quinn said he was most pleased with Collins’ competitiveness against the Cardinals.\n“He had really difficult matchups on a number of good players and he just kept responding,” Quinn said. “We are anxious to see where he goes but, for me, his arrow is certainly trending up.”\nThe Falcons selected Collins in the second round of the 2015 draft out of LSU and his size/speed combination seemed to make him a good fit for Quinn’s defense. But Collins struggled in coverage as a rookie and then missed the first four games of this season because of a violation of the NFL’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\nThe Falcons didn’t activate Collins for the first two games after he was eligible to return. He played solely on special teams in the Week 7 loss to the Chargers and then was back on the inactive list for Week 8.\nNow the Falcons are counting on Collins to fill in for their best cornerback.\nRobinson was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals following the 2012 draft out of Notre Dame. The Nebraska native spent two years with the Bengals, until he was signed by the San Diego Chargers off of Cincinnati’s practice squad in 2014. Robinson spent two seasons with the Chargers.\nWreh-Wilson was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the third round of the 2013 draft out of Connecticut. The past three seasons, Wreh-Wilson has played in 34 games with 14 starts and has recorded 73 tackles, one interception, and one forced fumble.",

While some rotation is expected, the Reds have shown they have a squad capable of coping with such changes and it looks an uphill battle for Garry Monk's men to transfer a good run of Championship form into a result here. \nWith that in mind, 3/1 (4.0) about a Liverpool win should prove a great option for those who are yet to open a Betfair account and want to kick start their balance. Not only is this a fantastic price on the match but anyone taking it up will get their money back as a free bet if the selection loses plus the chance to claim £100 in free bets on subsequent wagers. \nTo take advantage of this offer, simply register using the links provided, place your first bet on Liverpool at the usual price shown on site and if they win as expected then the returns will be topped up at the final whistle. \nWith no European competition to worry about this season, Klopp can afford to use this opportunity to evaluate the depths of his squad but the teams for previous rounds have been far from second string. \nThe likes of Lucas, Jordan Henderson and Divock Origi started in the 3-0 win over Derby County, and the Belgian striker will certainly feel he has a fantastic opportunity to stake his claim for a starting spot, having come off the bench to open the scoring against Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday. \nNot many punters will be keen to get behind Klopp's side at just 2/7 (1.29) but at 3/1 (4.0) with Betfair the Reds certainly look like a tempting prospect at Anfield.

    "text": "Cowboys Running Back Ezekiel Elliott Might Be Looking To Get In The Restaurant Business The Cowboys’ rookie running back has already trademarked his first concept share Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images By now, you’re probably already familiar with Ezekiel Elliott ’s famous “Let’s Eat” hand gesture, seen on the field every time the record-breaking running back gets a first down or scores a touchdown. In the future, though, Zeke could be using that slogan for his own restaurant concept. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that Elliott has trademarked a number of phrases associated with his name , like the aforementioned “Let’s Eat” slogan. Most interesting, though, is Zeke’s Crop Top Bar & Grill , the restaurant name trademarked by Elliott for potential future use. Does this mean that Elliott is looking to get into the restaurant business? The trademark was registered by Elliott back in 2015, while he was attending Ohio State University. A look at the trademark application indicates that the name was specifically set aside for use as a restaurant concept , and is a nod to Elliott’s penchant for rolling his jersey up like a crop top. Sadly, it appears that Elliott has never made a public comment on when — or even where — the restaurant would make its debut. Now, considering that Elliott is too busy breaking rushing records and scoring touchdowns, it’s unlikely that he’ll be looking to break into the food service business any time soon.

    "text": "Cowboys Running Back Ezekiel Elliott Might Be Looking To Get In The Restaurant Business The Cowboys’ rookie running back has already trademarked his first concept share Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images By now, you’re probably already familiar with Ezekiel Elliott ’s famous “Let’s Eat” hand gesture, seen on the field every time the record-breaking running back gets a first down or scores a touchdown. In the future, though, Zeke could be using that slogan for his own restaurant concept. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that Elliott has trademarked a number of phrases associated with his name , like the aforementioned “Let’s Eat” slogan. Most interesting, though, is Zeke’s Crop Top Bar & Grill , the restaurant name trademarked by Elliott for potential future use. Does this mean that Elliott is looking to get into the restaurant business? The trademark was registered by Elliott back in 2015, while he was attending Ohio State University. A look at the trademark application indicates that the name was specifically set aside for use as a restaurant concept , and is a nod to Elliott’s penchant for rolling his jersey up like a crop top. Sadly, it appears that Elliott has never made a public comment on when — or even where — the restaurant would make its debut. Now, considering that Elliott is too busy breaking rushing records and scoring touchdowns, it’s unlikely that he’ll be looking to break into the food service business any time soon. But since he’s in Dallas at least through 2019, perhaps Zeke’s Crop Top Bar & Grill will make its debut by the time his contract is up.",

    "text": "21 Nov, 2016 Deposits, withdrawals, and purchases post-demonetisation: Who's allowed to do what After Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the currency ban on November 8, there have been restrictions on withdrawals from ATMs, and on deposits of defunct notes in banks. However, the government has announced some exceptions in the 13 days that have passed since demonetisation was implemented. Here's a useful guide that will help you understand how much you can borrow or deposit, or in what circumstances you can still use the defunct notes. 1. What you can normally withdraw \nNormally, you can only withdraw Rs 2000 on any given day from an ATM. If you're depositing the demonetised notes, you need to mention your PAN card details if you're depositing more than Rs 2.5 lakh. 2. Special withdrawal limit for marriages \nWill wedding bells soon be ringing at home? If yes, take note: you can withdraw up to Rs 2.5 lakh in cash. But remember, you can only withdraw money from the credit balance \"as of close of business on November 8.\" And you can only use the cash you withdraw to pay people who don't have bank accounts. What's more, you'll have to provide their names when you apply for permission for a special withdrawal. There's more. On your application, you need to mention the date of the wedding (which can't be later than December 30), and the names, addresses, and identity documents of the bride and groom. 3. Special weekly withdrawal limits for current accounts, overdraft accounts, cash credit accounts \nIf you have a current account, an overdraft account or a cash credit account which has been operational for the last three months or more, you can withdraw up to Rs 50,000 per week. 4. Getting cash at petrol pumps \nYou can head to select petrol pumps to swipe your card, and get Rs 2000 in cash. 5. 60 additional days for repayment of loans worth up to Rs 1 crore \nIf you've taken out a housing, car, farm, or another kind of loan worth up to Rs 1 crore payable between November 1 and December 31, you now have 60 additional days to repay the money. However, this is just a short-term deferment, and won't result in a restructuring of your loan. Read more. 6. Now, Rs 500 notes can be used to buy seeds \nFarmers who need to buy seeds can now use their old Rs 500 notes to do so . They can purchase them after showing ID proof at the following places: centres, units or outlets belonging to the central or state governments, public sector undertakings, national or state seeds corporations, central or state agricultural universities and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. 7. Use of defunct notes partially allowed till November 24 \nUntil November 24, you should still be able to use the demonetised notes at the following places (or for the following purposes): government hospitals, railway and airline ticketing, public transport, milk booths, crematoria and burial grounds, petrol pumps. You should also be able to use the old notes to make payments for metro rail tickets, highway and road tolls, medicines (from both government and private pharmacies, with a doctor's prescription), LPG gas cylinders, railway catering, electricity and water bills and Architectural Survey of India monument entry tickets. In addition, you're allowed to use the old notes at consumer co-operative stores with a valid ID proof, and to pay court fees. Inputs from PTI  ",

    "text": "NEW YORK — The Boston Celtics were the first team to break out the tactic last season.\nIt was a January game at Madison Square and Kristaps Porzingis, thanks to an array of deep bombs and silky jumpers, was torching the visitors to the tune of 20 first-half points. In the locker room prior to the third quarter Celtics head coach Brad Stevens decided to try something that later (that evening) he’d call “kind of crazy\"—slotting 6”4’ guard Marcus Smart onto the Knicks ’ 7”3 dynamo.\nSmart responded by getting up in Porzingis’ chest. His foot speed took away the advantage Porzingis so often had when facing lumbering bigs. The comfort he had defending away from the basket was something Porzingis had rarely faced. \nThe Knicks tried to answer by featuring Porzingis in the post, but that didn’t work either. He struggled getting position. The few times he did get the ball, he looked unsure of how to attack. He got off just six shots in the second half and connected on only three of them.\nNearly a decade earlier, NBA coaches had discovered that smaller and quicker defenders could stifle Dirk Nowitzki . That same strategy was now being deployed against Nowitzki’s clone.\nBack then Nowitzki responded by learning how to take what the defense was offering: If opposing coaches were going to guard him with smaller defenders, then he’d have to learn to shoot over them. And so the one-legged fadeaway, a simple move that would morph Nowitzki into an unguardable force (and, eventually, NBA champion) was born.   \nPorzingis knew all this. As a kid growing up in Latvia, he studied Nowitzki video clips. The Knicks even tried setting up a joint workout with two players this summer, but their respective schedules didn’t gel.\nStill, Porzingis devoted time and energy over the offseason to becoming a weapon closer to the basket, to developing his own version of the one-legged fade-away. His counters might not be as distinct as the shot Nowitkzi invented, but they’ve accelerated the clock on his stardom and  transformed Porzingis into a dominant offensive beast.",

    "text": "RBI shows interest in no-interest banking. What does it mean? RBI shows interest in no-interest banking. What does it mean? RBI has proposed the opening of an ‘Islamic window’ in banks to ‘gradually’ introduce Sharia-compliant banking in India. Written by ZEESHAN SHAIKH | Updated: November 25, 2016 2:03 am There has been a surge of interest in Islamic finance even in non-Islamic countries, says the World Bank. (Source: Reuters) \nWhat exactly is Sharia banking? \nSharia banking refers to banking activity that conforms to Islamic law or Sharia. The fundamental principle of Islamic finance is the rejection of usury, along with the requirement that there must be no engagement in immoral businesses. Usury is seen as the levying of unreasonably high interest rates while lending money. Interest is Riba, which in its current interpretation, covers all interest — not just excessive interest. Under Islamic law, a Muslim is prohibited from both paying and accepting interest. Thus, Sharia banking means money can only be parked in a bank without interest — and this money cannot be used for speculative trading, gambling, or trading in prohibited commodities such as alcohol or pork. \nWatch What Else Is making News \nWhat is the rationale for Sharia banking? \nThe concept is aimed primarily at devout Muslims who do not participate in the conventional banking system due to religious restrictions, including not taking credit from banks to expand businesses. There is no recent data on the number of Muslims who have bank accounts, but the Sachar Committee report released in 2006 said that Muslims hold 12.2% of accounts in public sector banks and 11.3% in private sector banks — lower than their share of 13.4% cent in the population as a whole. \nA large chunk of Muslims are, however, a part of the conventional banking system, and both pay and receive interest. Some religious scholars have noted that the interest in the conventional banking systems is not the same as usury, and the levying and receiving of interest at a fixed rate is allowed. Large parts of the Islamic world, including Pakistan, adhere to conventional banking practices. \nIntroduction of Sharia or Islamic banking could bring more Muslims into the banking system, and help in the inflow of institutional wealth from entities operating in the Islamic world to the Indian economy. Sharia banking is not restricted to Muslims alone, and other communities who are interested in other forms of banking like ethical banking could be allowed to participate. \nOkay, but how does a bank work without interest being charged or given? \nWhile banking itself is premised on charging interest while lending and paying interest on deposits, certain banks do structure their accounts in Sharia compliant ways. For those who want to take credit from a Sharia compliant bank the instrument of Ijara is available — in which the bank purchases the asset on behalf of the client and allows its usage for a fixed rental. After a mutually agreed time, the ownership of the asset is transferred to the client. \nAnother instrument is the Murabaha for working capital, in which the asset is purchased by the bank at market price and sold to the customer at a mutually-decided marked-up cost. The client can repay in instalments. \nMusharaka is a joint investment by the bank and the client, in which both contribute to funding an investment or purchase, and agree to share the profit or loss in agreed-upon proportions. \nFor savings accounts, there are two kinds of deposits. In one, customers can deposit their savings and allow the bank to use this money, with the assurance that they would get the full amount back. The bank is not liable to pay interest to the savers. However, some banks do give a certain sum back to the account holder as profit accrued from their operations. \nIn the other kind, the holder allows the bank to invest his money in specific projects and gets returns after a stipulated term based on how the business performs. \nHow common is Sharia banking globally? \nA 2015 World Bank report estimated Sharia-compliant financial assets to be in the range of US $ 2 trillion, covering bank and non-bank financial institutions, capital markets, money markets and insurance. The Islamic Finance Industry has been expanding at a rate of 10%-12% annually. According to the World Bank, in many Muslim countries, Islamic banking assets have been growing faster than conventional banking assets. There has also been a surge of interest in Islamic finance in non-Muslim countries such as the UK, Luxembourg, South Africa, and Hong Kong. \n“Over the past decade Islamic finance has emerged as an effective tool for financing development worldwide, including in non-Muslim countries. Major financial markets are discovering solid evidence that Islamic finance has already been mainstreamed within the global financial system — and that it has the potential to help address the challenges of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity,” the World Bank report said. \nWhat are the hurdles to implementing Sharia banking in India? \nThere is some political opposition — parties such as the Shiv Sena have said they will oppose its introduction. Because of the strict adherence to not paying or taking interest, Sharia banking will call for a complete overhaul of the banking regulatory system. There is also concern that India lacks adequate manpower trained in Sharia banking. \nWhat steps have been taken towards Sharia banking in India so far? \nIn a report submitted to the government in 2008, a committee headed by Raghuram Rajan (who subsequently went on to become RBI Governor) had, without naming Sharia banking, suggested the need to have interest-free banking in India. “The non-availability of interest-free banking products (where the return to the investor is tied to the bearing of risk, in accordance with the principles of that faith) results in some Indians, including those in the economically disadvantaged strata of society, not being able to access banking products and services due to reasons of faith. This non-availability also denies India access to substantial sources of savings from other countries in the region,” the report said. \nThe Kerala government had subsequently tried to co-promote an Islamic finance institution, but the move was challenged in the High Court. \nThe RBI has now said that given the complexities of Islamic finance and various regulatory and supervisory challenges involved, and also due to the fact that Indian banks have no experience in this field, Islamic banking may be introduced in a gradual manner. \n“Initially, a few simple products which are similar to conventional banking products may be considered for introduction through Islamic window of the conventional banks… Introduction of full-fledged Islamic banking with profit-loss sharing complex products may be considered at a later stage on the basis of experience…,” the RBI has said.

Your love and support has been our strength.” \nHe also spoke about his relationship with Kavya, “We have been living together for the last two to three years. I talked with my family and we finalised it after discussions with Kavya’s family.” The Malayalam actor also spoke about how controversial this relationship has been for both of them, “The only crime I have committed is that I have acted in some 20 films. But she has always been a victim of gossip, and has been portrayed as being responsible for the break up of my marriage.

Mr Fraser described the offence as a \"spectacular\" breach of the order and said it was concerning as Edwards had a previous conviction for assaulting a child of a similar age.\nSocial workers were tipped off that Edwards was alone in the house with the child and the police were called. Defence lawyer Fiona Hamilton said the child was supposed to be watched by a neighbour who was unable to do so.\nShe said Edwards thought the two women were only going to a nearby shop for 20 minutes and was unaware they had gone to Hawick.\nMs Hamilton said Edwards, who lives in Eyemouth, had tried to comply with the order and there was no planning involved in being in contact with the child. She added: \"He did not want to say no.\"\nSheriff Peter Paterson jailed him for 80 days and added another 120 days for an unexpired part of his previous prison sentence after being released early.\nEarlier this year Edwards was jailed for 12 months after a jury at Selkirk Sheriff Court convicted him of speaking to two children afed five and two at a bus stop and on a bus journey between Berwick and Eyemouth where he offered them money and sweets - which breached the terms of his Sexual Offences Prevention Order.\nLast updated Thu 24 Nov 2016 Cumbria",

    "text": "share Esther Lin, MMA Fighting \nIt's not saying much to note grappling is changing both inside of mixed martial arts (MMA) and out. The key question is, how is grappling evolving? Is it modernizing, regressing or going in unexpected directions? \nAs it turns out, the answer is messy. ADCC bronze medalist and UFC featherweight - as well as season 22 winner of The Ultimate Fighter - Ryan Hall has a few theories. On the one hand, the overall level of skill is up, but there's a curious homogenization going on inside of the sport. \nOutside of MMA, although perhaps related to it, a growing sub-only preference is affecting both how fans perceive jiu-jitsu and what is getting prioritized. Positional control, for example, has given way to a thirst for finishes. Yet, is that really what grappling in MMA or jiu-jitsu needs? Even as the base level of skill gets higher, are these healthy developments? \nIn this edition of the Technique Talk, we talk with the Felipe Costa black belt about what's happened to grappling, where it might be headed and whether those developments are positive. Partial transcript and full audio below: \nI want to start with something a black belt told me, which is, \"Mount is a lost art.\" That's not to say mount is going away or that all black belts have the same opinion. However, I wonder if you agree and if so, why? \nI don't disagree with the statement unnamed black belt made. I think that mount has been a lost art for a long time. In competitive jiu-jitsu, it was something only a few people really had a handle on and it being a lost art was almost a common sentiment even 6-8, 10 years back. \nAs positions have evolved and rules have changed, behaviors change. Speaking personally, I have a great deal of interest in how rules structures and incentive structures affect behavior. When I see Roger Gracie - who is a master of the mounted position - when you look at Rickson Gracie , Demian Maia in mixed martial arts, and he's obviously an incredibly strong positional grappler - there are guys who have these positions really dialed in. I think it's been going away for some period of time and I don't envision it making a comeback, honestly. \nIt's incredibly valuable and the mounted position is something that I feel is one of my strongest spots. It's something I've spent an incredible amount of time attempting to understand from people that are good at it, and also trying to watch the best people in the world at it - the Roger Gracies, the Rickson Gracies - but even in the process of learning, I had a difficult time tracking down information and insight because even at a high level of jiu-jitsu, it's just not a very common position. \nI see it going even further in that direction, particularly with the popularity of submission-only rule sets. You're not incentivized to build that skill. If you have that skill already at a high level, you can use it, but there are easier paths to victory and people, generally speaking, will take those paths. We see the guard in competitive jiu-jitsu growing. It's so much better and dangerous and diverse than it was in the late 90s or mid 2000s, but other things go away. As that has occurred, other things have fallen by the wayside. The mounted position is absolutely one of them. Side control as well. The dominating positions are kind of disappearing and I really hope that is not a trend that continues long term. \nDemian Maia is unlike every other grappler including black belts, but it feels like one of his core insight is that while everyone else is not building this skill, he still is. Therefore, there is a skills gap. Why can't his fundamental insight be replicable at scale? \nI believe that is replicable on a certain level. Not only does he have that skill developed to a razor's edge, it's also that he's not competing against people that kinda sorta have it or even used to have it. When Demian Maia mounts you for the first time, it's not like being mounted by somebody else. He's dealt with great, high levels of opposition and they haven't. \nSo, not only are you dealing with the fact that he's very good at it, it's the first time you're experiencing it at this level. It's like fighting a Wonderboy [ Stephen Thompson ] in striking. It's like, 'Well, I've been in there with other good strikers.' Yeah, but not quite like this guy. \nIt's funny. I believe these things to be replicable. But you have to go out and find the sources of information and MMA is an interesting thing. It's subject to the same prejudices and traditions that are everywhere. Speaking personally, I build my entire game into the holes that I believe are people's thought processes. Think about five, ten years back, it was 'we know how to fight'. It's wrestling and Muay Thai. Initially it was jiu-jitsu and then it was 'No, it's wrestling and anti-jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai'. \nNow people are saying karate is good all of a sudden. If you or I had told people ten years ago that karate is good, we'd have been laughed out of the room. There's skill sets that people become obsessed with and just like any sport, they're cyclical. \nPeople could go through the challenges of learning how to control from the mount, but the reality is they'd have to go through jiu-jitsu in order to learn that skill at a high level because classical jiu-jitsu is guard versus pass. Even now, that's disappearing. When you go sub only, it's no longer guard versus pass because the amount of investment, time and energy that is takes to, one, develop that skill and two, use it in a match, is disproportionate when you consider the return on investment you can get from doing something like a foot lock. \nIsn't what underscores the value of sub only the insight that to really put someone away, paying too much attention to guard vs. pass doesn't matter so much? \nTo a certain extent. When you start adding punches, it matters a lot. In my opinion, it makes it very significant. I don't feel any threat almost from anyone when I'm on the bottom in MMA. Their pass understanding is not strong enough, generally speaking, to get into a position where they can launch a sustained attack in a way that's going to be very damaging. Not saying it couldn't occur, but it's going to be difficult. It's like footwork in striking. \nOne of the things we have to note about the sub-only matches - not all the sub-only matches, of course, because you get some very high-level people - is it's B-level grapplers competing against other B-level grapplers or B-level grapplers competing against an A-level grappler. You don't see really, truly high-level positional dominance until you get to the A+ level of control. Mistakes are made - technical, strategic, tactical. Sub only has taught us some really valuable lessons in pointing out some holes that always existed, but we have to guard against the possibility of regressing and becoming as dogmatic in our new view that this is the thing as we were initially. \nLook how long it took, frankly, most of the Gracie jiu-jitsu types to become traditional martial artists. They were the leading, cutting edge of, 'Hey, this is the new stuff. You guys need to learn it.' Now, they're obsessed with what their path was and saying this and that's not the real jiu-jitsu. It's more of a mentality than anything else that's either growth oriented or not. \nWhat else is going away in jiu-jitsu as it relates to MMA in terms of what we're able to effectively transport? \nCertain people's wrestling is better than ever, but in a lot of cases it's worse than ever. Again, as much as you can avoid wrestling under certain circumstances in almost everything other than ADCC, when you compete in jiu-jitsu now in sub only, wrestling has been effectively neutered. \nIt looks to me like I'd have been borderline impossible to beat in sub only. Not impossible, but just on this side of it. It changes the nature of everything. I'm really glad that I had the losses I did and the frustrations I did because it forced me to learn all sorts of things that I might not have otherwise had to learn if the opponents that I couldn't make play my game at the time were forced to engage me on my terms. \nI see that people don't wrestle anymore, people don't have as strong of a base. Again, this is painting with broad strokes. There are obviously fantastic grapplers. A lot of the sub-only cultures has brought in many, many positive things, but positional control and wrestling are just going to fall by the wayside. The reality is, at a low level, submission dangerous is always, always, always more valuable than positional control. \nIf you're a blue belt, a purple belt, you're not that good. You have not the experience. I wonder if we would've gotten the Marcelo Garcias, we would've gotten the Roger Gracies if the rule set would've encouraged a different type of behavior. Maybe we would, maybe we wouldn't, but what I'm interested to see if people continue to develop guard in a way that is useful and valid in MMA, but does not rely on the rule set and the approach that people have under the rule set of a sub-only context. \nThis is what baffles me. In pure jiu-jitsu, the guard has exploded in usefulness. In MMA, that's not necessarily the case. Where is the guard? \nIt's interesting. On the one hand, let's say take a bunch of guys that are elite-level wrestlers. Fantastic athletes, brilliant skill set, but very specific type of grappling. You have these guys fight MMA. Certain things are going to work very well for them because their mentality, their tactics, their techniques and certain things are going to be borderline like, 'Hey, go to the bottom.' \nWhy would going to the bottom be poor? One, because they're dealing with someone of a really high caliber on top. Two, they lack a significant amount of experience on bottom themselves, only compounding the problem. \nWhat we see a lot of what's happened in MMA is, let's say you grapple with anyone at a high level and then you get to kick them in the head four or five times really, really hard right before grappling them, you're going to have a significantly different experience win, lose or draw in that engagement. \nOne of the things sub only and the general direction things are going is the obsession with submissions similar to the obsessions with knockouts or power. You always hear the way UFC markets itself is 'So and so has unbelievable knockout power!' I'm like, we have four-ounce gloves on. Everybody can hurt everybody. Some people have a disturbing amount of power like Anthony Johnson will put you six feet under with his right hand, but for the most part, everybody has the capacity to hurt everyone. \nBut that's actually a very low bar to clear. If I punch Floyd Mayweather in the face, I know I can knock him out. We're the same size. He's not magic. Now, I guarantee if he didn't want me to hit him in the face, I wouldn't come within spitting distance, but it's not this mythical fan-speak 'chin' thing that no matter what people do to you, you don't fall over. Or, not matter what someone does to Marcelo Garcia, he gets out. I think if we look through the course of his matches or Roger Gracie's matches, Floyd Mayweather's fights, we can see the handful of times even against elite opposition that they were placed in true existential danger and that speaks to a specific approach that maybe we could or couldn't have. \nCircling back, a lot of the guard stuff has been opportunistic because people are coming to MMA with a little bit less traditional jiu-jitsu experience, which is fine because they're going to get diminishing returns on that investment in most cases. So, they're not going to be as effective and diverse from the bottom as Demian Maia would be, whose wrestling is excellent but is made even more effective by the fact that if he's in trouble, he'll just slide right down to half guard and then come back on up in a way that maybe someone of a higher caliber of wrestling but a different type of grappler would lack that opportunity. \nThat was a bit all over the place, but there's a lot of room for growth and we're just beginning to scratch the surface and I'm interested to see what comes next. \nI wonder what you think of the idea that someone like Khabib Nurmagomedov might be the future. He can pass some and play guard a little, but what he's really good at is intense pressure, takedowns from every conceivable scenario and a thousand different kinds of rides. Is that the future of MMA grappling? \nThat's certainly a future of MMA grappling. I think Khabib is an absolute savage. He's unbelievable to watch. He reminds of watching Ben Askren . If you watch them both, they are all over you like a cheap freakin' suit. They have such a deep understanding of throws, takedowns, body positioning that they're not trying to force a blast double. \nLook at guys like Khabib, guys like Askren, guys Daniel Cormier , obviously they're great athletes, but in addition to that, they're brilliantly skillful. They have a deep understanding of their sport and they know how to take you down 4,000 different ways and they know how to stick with you. That's just a different level of grappling competitor. \nI think when we can get those guys involved, whether they come from the jiu-jitsu world, whether they come from the wrestling world, they're able to seamlessly transition between the feet to the ground to the top to the bottom. Of course, they're going to have their strengths and their weaknesses like every art and competitor will, but they are, more or less, a complete profile of grappler. I think that's when you're looking at something pretty special. \nI do believe that will be the future. Obviously, everyone can't do it, but then again, maybe everyone can. It's just a matter of maybe we'll adjust our training methods and idea of what's possible. \nWe look at the way people strike now, how far it's come in such a short period of time. I believe a lot of that has to do with seeing brilliant examples of Wonderboy, guys like that getting involved. How great [Donald] Cerrone is now. \nImagine Saenchai [PKSaenchaimuaythaigym] got into MMA. Whether he ended up being the greatest MMA fighter or not, he would do things that would blow people's minds and would expand our understanding of what's possible, which would make us reach further and reach for more. I believe that's going to continue to happen with each individual art. \nI'm not saying this is the defining theory of the present, but we had this theory 10 years ago that the next generation of fighter was going to have MMA as their base. Again, I'm not saying there's no exception, but I think we're seeing a lot of homogenized skill sets without anyone especially progressing. Am I being alarmist? \nI don't disagree with you one bit, actually. Of course, individuals will be successful more of less successful for a variety of reasons. \nOne of the mistakes we have to avoid making is no one can out smart the way the world is. To think that I'm going to come up with \"These are my special moves and all I need to do is teach a person X, Y and Z and they're going to be an absolute killer in anything.\" \nThink about learning a language. \"With X many hours of practice you'll be fluent.\" Well, that's not quite realistic and that doesn't mean you won't have a decent level of ability, but to think I can go out there, learn a formula and then just start handling business no matter what is overly optimistic. \nOne of the things we undervalue is the amount of experience gained from competing at a sport at a high level. Let's say you look at amateur MMA. For the most part, amateur MMA fighters are not very good. That's not a knock. I wasn't any good at MMA. I'm only learning now, but you're going to face much stiffer competition in amateur boxing. Amateur MMA is much more of a real fight than all of these other things, but at the same time, what's the more developed thing? \nYou're going to face stiffer competition in tennis. You're going to face stiffer competition in tennis than in amateur boxing, probably, but the idea is developing the mental attributes and the ability to compete and get your mind in the right place and these other things that allow for success down the line. Also, realizing that you have to be a little bit different. Everyone's going to find themselves. In my opinion, that's why wrestling is so great. \nEveryone says, 'Wrestlers are the best MMA fighters'. I think that's bullshit. I think that the people that compete in a well-developed sport since they were four years old end up being very, very, very good baseline learners at almost anything. You take that guy and you compare him to someone that started doing boxing or jiu-jitsu at age 22 and that second guy is significantly behind the eight ball. It doesn't mean wrestling's not an incredible skill set, but there's never going to be any true formula other than getting out there and getting experience in finding yourself. \nOne of the guys I train with right now is a guy named Tom Lee and his brother Vin. Tom is someone I met on the show on The Ultimate Fighter. Tom is absolutely an unbelievable striker. An incredible striker, but he came up with a taekwondo background. When I saw him competing on the show we nearly became friends because he was cool as ice, doing his thing. He had the feel of an experienced martial artist even though he only had four fights just like me. \nWhat I find to be interesting is that, the common quality between most of the people that I find are really successful. Look at Stephen Thompson. He came up in karate and kickboxing, but I guarantee he faced tough competition along that circuit and he was able to learn MMA a little more quickly than most. Chris Weidman , fantastic fighter, came up in wrestling and other things. \nMaybe amateur MMA will one day be a great path to learn that, but until it's more developed, I think they're always going to be a little bit wanting in certain regards compared to the single sport athletes. \nI'd say these days the floor on wrestling skill in MMA is higher than it used to be, but the guys who rely on the wall - not saying using the wall is bad - I just mean someone like Chris Weidman. He uses the wall, but he's got plenty of takedowns right in the middle of the cage. Same with Daniel Cormier. He might use the wall, but he also might lift you off of your feet in the middle of the cage. The guys who can diversify are the better ones, but am I putting too much pressure on the ones who aren't Cormier to do that? \nFull disclosure to anyone who might be listening, I'm not a world-class-level takedown guy, but I need to be able to get the fight to the ground on a world-class level. That's the real question. \nThat circles back to my issue with sub only - and I have issues with the IBJJF former rules. People will, generally speaking, train and prepare to win under a certain rule set. I beat certain people in jiu-jitsu I was nowhere near as good as and I never got beat up by them, but I lost and was edged out by people I would murder if we had a sub-only match or MMA fight at that time or now. \nYou look at a DC or Askren or Khabib, a Chris Weidman, you're talking about people who've made a commitment to learning the technical side of their sport, not just being successful on the mat. That is one of the downsides of the single sports. It becomes more about winning than learning. Of course, the goal is to fight and win, but at the end of the day, what really matters is are you becoming an effective martial artist, not just playing by the rules? \nSpeaking personally, there was a time I'd either win by submission or lose by points. That's not the greatest situation in the world for me. I'm glad that I lost those times, but if I'd have been competing at sub only back then, certainly as a blue or purple belt, I don't know realistically if there was anyone I'd have bet on to beat me, when the rules were not designed specifically to hide my flaws. \nIf took Rafael Mendes and put him in MMA, I think he'd be a killer. If you took Cobrinha and put him in MMA, I think he'd be a killer. Right out the gate? Of course not. Certain people got in way over the head way too early. Jacare got knocked out by Macaco very early in his career. Jacare is a significantly better martial artist than Macaco was even at that time, but he lacked the experience and thank goodness he stayed in it. Now we know him to be the incredible fighter he is. \nSometimes when we take the individual sports, we take people that are very successful and they are successful because of the rules of that sport. The rules hide their flaws. If you don't need the referee to protect yourself from me and we're grappling, you're probably a pretty good grappler. \nI remember for the longest time the knock on me was I needed the referee to protect me from other people and they were right. When I realized people saying that were right, I went out of my way to go and learn other things. Plenty of guys will say spider guard, worm guard stuff, that has literally zero relevance to MMA. That person should at least admit to him or herself what it is that they're practicing and what it is that's allowing them to be successful. \nMaybe there's some stuff in MMA or BJJ that's going away, but needs to go away. Do you see anything naturally getting weeded out that's a good thing to see off? \nThere are so many things that I thought were invalid that I believe now to be valid and certain things I was sure that were valid that are a little bit less so. \nI was watching Kron Gracie fight in Rizin in Japan. He's a phenomenal grappler, top or bottom, all positions. Brilliant jiu-jitsu. The fact that he has 10-minute round to work with significantly impacts the flow of the fight. I guess I can speak very specifically in the context of UFC or unified rules, I think certain positions like closed guard are going to be a little bit tough. \nA lot maybe traditional understanding of what striking is - and this is speculative - the biggest change we're going to see is the operating assumptions of what MMA really is. Where does the guard fit in? What types of guard? What types of situations? Rather than saying the guard is a valid tool, say the guard is a valid tool under X, Y and Z circumstance. \nEarmuffs defense you see in boxing is really, really, really ballsy/foolish for MMA. Yet, because people spar with big gloves and try to take each other's head off a lot, you'll still people try to use it. Doesn't mean it's completely ineffective, but maybe a karate-style with movement and a little bit more distance and a little bit more deception is a little bit more useful under many circumstances. \nI don't know. I wish I could give you a more concrete answer, but I just believe many of our operating assumptions are going to be considerably changed and we're going to start seeing much more evolved training methods that are going to allow us to make these determinations more quickly and more effectively. \nSo, what is something, even something small, that you feel like needs to be added as a best practice? \nThe way that people wrestle on the fence is going to change significantly. I also believe the way that people approach the guard is going to change significantly. I feel very fortunate to have come along in jiu-jitsu at the time I did because I got to watch Demian Maia, BJ Penn, Roger Gracie. I got the benefit of watching them push forward the art and then also struggle and succeed brilliantly in MMA. \nWe realize how incredible Demian Maia is and he was successful right when he got to the UFC, but then he struggled a little bit. It was that struggle that pushed him forward to the absolutely razor sharp, phenomenal mixed martial artist that he is now. \nI believe that one of the things that's going to change significantly is going to be the usage of the guard and how it happens as well as the expectations are from there. The way that most people try to do it from there is very foolish and designed for failure. Of course, it fails and then it becomes a little self fulfilling at that point and then people say, 'Ah, it doesn't work!' when I would say it doesn't work when you do it like that. \nI also believe the way people wrestle on the fence is going to change significantly. I'll see if I can have a little hand on that, if possible, but I think people are going to continue to become more indirect. If we look at Wonderboy, he's striking in a way you're not taking a ton of damage. You're not trying to shoehorn other strategies from other sports into this new activity. You're simply taking the lessons learned there and asking, 'how does this apply to this new area?' rather than saying, 'let me tell you how to wrestle'. No, that's how you wrestle in a wrestling match. How do we wrestle in a cage? That's only going to continue and the guard is going to be a significant part of that as people with the proper skill set get in there. In this Storystream",

    "text": "Share on Facebook \nIt's looking more likely that President-elect Donald Trump will preside over a continuing U.S. expansion that could take its place as the longest among American business cycles, according to Deutsche Bank AG. And Chief U.S. Equity Strategist David Bianco predicts that by the time the real estate mogul takes office in January, the S&P 500 Index will eclipse 2,250. \nInvestors are under-appreciating the \"much higher chance now of a long lasting economic expansion that rivals the 10 year U.S. record,\" the strategist writes \"We're more confident now that the S&P will reach 2,500 in 2018 before suffering its next bear market.\" \nThe longest U.S. expansion on record stretched from 1991 until 2001, a span of 120 months. That streak will be broken if the American economy makes it until 2019 without a recession. \nThe structural decline in potential growth means that it doesn't take as large a negative shock as it used to in order to precipitate a downturn in U.S. activity. Conversely, the rising portion of retirees on Social Security increases the stickiness of consumption, dampening the variability of the largest component of GDP. \nWhile Bianco doesn't discount the risks to Corporate America's bottom line posed by a rising U.S. dollar, potential protectionist trade policies under a Trump administration, and the rise in Treasury yields, he thinks the more important things for investors to focus on are lower taxes and the increase in bank profitability. \nDeutsche Bank estimates that the U.S. corporate tax rate will be cut to about 25 percent — which would bring it in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average — and suggests that every 5 percentage point cut lifts the earnings per share of S&P 500 companies by a cumulative $5.00. Source: Deutsche Bank \nAs such, Bianco upped his earnings per share target for the S&P 500 to \"at least\" $130 for 2017, which would constitute annual growth of over 9 percent (assuming his 2016 estimate of $119 is on the mark). \"We’re unsure how much the U.S. corporate tax rate will be cut, but we think a significant cut is likely,\" the strategist writes. \nIn the absence of measures to encourage the repatriation of profits held overseas, this corporate tax reduction would provide the most benefit to domestically-oriented companies. The Russell 2000 Index has massively outperformed the S&P 500 since Nov. 8. Source: Bloomberg \nA special repatriation tax holiday could further buoy financial asset prices, particularly if the proceeds were used for share buybacks , dividend boosts, or M&A. \nMeanwhile, bonds won't become attractive enough of an alternative to crimp stock valuations or cause companies to face higher interest expenses. The continuation of the Fed's tightening cycle will keep the labor market from overheating and put a cap on the longer end of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, he added. As such, Bianco recommends that investors in need of income should turn to utilities stocks, which have been battered since the election. \n\"Utilities benefit from: 1) a lower U.S. corp tax rate given nearly 100 percent U.S. profits and thus no foreign exchange risk, 2) likely continued 15 percent tax rate on dividends versus income tax rates for interest income and the 3.8 percent Affordable Care Act tax is likely dropped, 3) more Federal infrastructure grants and loans for transmission upgrades, 4) a safe haven for retirees and institutions looking to reduce fixed income exposure,\" he concludes. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE",

    "text": "COMMENTS Paul Morigi/FilmMagic Kanye West attends the 2015 BET Honors at the Warner Theatre on Jan. 24, 2015 in Washington, DC. Â He'll need a doctor's note. \nYesterday (Nov. 21), after a rep for Kanye West confirmed that the remaining 21 dates of his Saint Pablo Tour would be canceled, Billboard estimated it would result in the refunding of more than 300,000 tickets, worth $27.3 million. At the time, however, the big unknown was why West canceled the dates, leaving open the question of whether insurance would cover the costs of shutting down the tour. \nLast night, West was placed under observation at a Los Angeles-area hospital, and a source told Billboard he was suffering from exhaustion and sleep deprivation. And while there is little to no further information about West's condition or the specific reasoning for canceling the tour dates, exhaustion raises several possibilities in terms of West's potential financial liabilities. \nAssuming West had insurance for his Saint Pablo Tour, a standard policy within the music industry would cover an \"accident to or illness of any insured person which, in the opinion of an independent medical practitioner approved by the underwriters, entirely prevents any insured person from appearing or continuing to appear in any or all of the insured performances or events.\" \nEssentially, that would require a third party medical practitioner to determine whether or not West's exhaustion would physically allow him to continue. But it also would typically come with exclusions: for instance, if the exhaustion was due to drug use, sexually-transmitted diseases, \"unreasonable or capricious behavior\" -- which would include cancellations as a result of excessive partying or similar behavior -- and whether there was a pre-existing condition, meaning if the person had a history of exhaustion or a previously-diagnosed and undisclosed illness. \nA fairly textbook example of a situation that would be covered by this type of policy is Lady Gaga 's 2013 Born This Way Ball Tour. With 22 dates to go on the trek, Gaga suffered a labral tear in her right hip that required surgery, forcing her to cancel the remaining shows on the tour and causing $25 million worth of ticket refunds. Gaga's injury clearly would have been covered by this type of insurance, including expenses related to shutting down the tour, advertising costs and lost revenues for both the promoter and performer. \nAgain, however, West's situation is slightly different, and there is no clear answer. \n\"[The policy] is often invoked very quickly for very specific injury or illness that is diagnosed easily,\" says Paul Bassman, president/CEO of Ascend Insurance Brokerage, one of the top insurance firms in the music industry. \"Exhaustion would definitely be harder to prove, but I wouldn't say it's impossible.\" \nLive Nation, the promoter for the Saint Pablo Tour, likely has its own policy, which generally differs from an artist's policy by not carrying exclusions for things like drug use, capricious behavior or other situations, though the independent medical evaluation would still be required. That could leave open a situation where Live Nation would be covered for its own expenses, including its guarantees to West, while if West's condition was not deemed to be covered by his insurance policy, he may still be on the hook. \nFor now there is little to do but hope that West is getting the treatment he requires, while any definitive judgment is too early to assess. \"We just don't know enough about why he canceled,\" Bassman adds. \"Until more information is available on the specifics of the cancellation, it's not possible to determine whether this will be covered by insurance or not.\"",

    "text": "WASHINGTON – Struggling to respond to Donald Trump’s victory, a group of shellshocked Democrats moved swiftly to endorse Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota for chairman of the Democratic National Committee, hoping he would be a fresh face for a party with a depleted bench.\nBut after steadily adding endorsements from leading Democrats in his bid to take over the party, Ellison is encountering resistance from a formidable corner: the White House.\nIn a sign of the discord gripping the party, President Obama’s loyalists, uneasy with the progressive Ellison, have begun casting about for an alternative, according to multiple Democratic officials close to the president.\nThe battle pits the titans of the Democratic Party against one another, with Obama’s camp at odds with figures like Chuck Schumer of New York, the new Senate Democratic leader, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\nObama’s advisers, some of whom discussed the party leadership race at a White House meeting last week, have talked about whether Labor Secretary Thomas Perez and former Gov. Jennifer Granholm of Michigan would be willing to run for the post. Perez met with Vice President Joe Biden last week and had lunch Tuesday in the White House Mess with Valerie Jarrett, Obama’s senior adviser, while also visiting with David Simas, Obama’s political director.\nSome in Obama’s circle were even holding out hope that Biden himself could be persuaded to step into the chairmanship, but Biden’s office said Tuesday that he was not interested.\nThe tumultuous tenure of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who was forced out as party leader in July, convinced a wide range of Democrats that whoever takes over the committee must make it their sole focus.\n“There’s too much at stake for us not to have somebody working in a full-time capacity,” said Michael Blake, a New York assemblyman and veteran of both of Obama’s campaigns, who is considering a DNC vice chairmanship.\nBut there are other reasons for the discomfort with Ellison that illustrate lingering divisions after a bruising presidential primary fight and a general election in which Hillary Clinton suffered deep losses among working-class whites and could not match Obama’s support among young and nonwhite voters.\nSome Democrats, in Obama’s orbit and beyond, believe that elevating Ellison would amount to handing the party to Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s primary opponent, and his liberal followers.\nEllison was a high-profile backer of Sanders’ presidential campaign, and Sanders has been rallying support for Ellison’s DNC bid. He ignited new controversy this week by saying the party needed to “go beyond identity politics.”\nSome top Democrats had hoped to pre-empt a contest by backing Ellison’s bid. Schumer, Warren and an array of House members and unions were lining up behind him even before he formally entered the race.\nBut along with his inability to do the job full-time and his ties to Sanders, Ellison’s past criticism of Obama and praise for Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, worry some Democrats looking for a figure to lead the opposition to Trump.\nEllison, a Muslim, defended Farrakhan in the 1990s, saying he was “not an anti-Semite,” and has positioned himself on the left flank of congressional Democrats on Israel.\nJonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, called Ellison “an important ally in the fight against anti-Semitism” but said he had taken positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “on which we strongly differ and that concern us.”\nThe AFL-CIO has been considering an endorsement of Ellison but delayed its decision, in part because organized labor has a good relationship with Perez. Perez called Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, to tell him he was seriously considering a run, according to three Democratic officials.\nAn Obama spokesman declined to comment on the race and said the administration was neutral. Perez and Granholm, who both declined to discuss whether they intended to run, were early supporters of Clinton’s campaign, which could turn the DNC race into the Clinton-vs.-Sanders proxy war that some Democrats want to avoid.",

He made the pledge at a debate to appoint a special prosecutor, and it smacks of Washington-as-usual for the reversal to slither out the back door. \nYet instead of the president-elect personally explaining his big decision, the public got snippets of comments he made during an interview with The New York Times. \n“I don’t want to hurt the Clintons, I really don’t,” the paper quoted him as saying. “She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways.” \nAsked whether he had ruled out a prosecution, he reportedly said, “It’s just not something that I feel very strongly about.” \nThe decision, if that’s what it is, and the ham-handed way it is being communicated, marks his first big blunder as president-elect. Discussing the topic first with the Times, which trashed its standards to demonize Trump and his supporters, compounds the error.",

When Metz moved to Hollywood from her home state of Florida, her agent at the time needed an assistant, so her manager suggested she lobby for the job. \"I came out here to be an actress but I needed to pay the bills and I didn't want to work with the general public,\" she laughs. \nShe took the job and soon she was off and running, \"working for peanuts\" but enjoying the opportunities to scout talent at showcases. \n\"I became really good at finding talent,\" Metz admits of the gig, which started \"sometime after 2000.\" She worked as a junior commercial agent at such reputable companies as Buchwald Talent Group and Abrams Artists Agency, putting her own dreams on the back burner, she said. \n\"I went on auditions maybe twice a year on my lunch break,\" she said. And it wasn't easy. \"I ended up gaining weight sitting behind a desk and being depressed. All people do is send you Sprinkles cupcakes, which is lovely but not when you're depressed and want to be an actress. But I thought if I can't do it for myself in my time, I can help other actors facilitate their dreams.\" \nShe's grateful for the journey, during which she learned about humility and hard work, not to mention how to read an actor's contracts. But because she's \"such a good girl,\" she never submitted herself for parts that she thought she might be better for than her own clients. Eventually one came along for her, playing Ima 'Barbara' Wiggles on American Horror Story , and she booked the job. The rest, as they say, is Hollywood history. \n\"I have been able to help my friends and people that I believe in pay their bills and stay afloat in L.A. while following their dreams,\" smiles Metz, who is now repped by Nick Roses at Pantheon Talent. (Even as a former agent, Metz stresses that she's not an impatient or demanding client. \"I know Nick very well and I know he has my best interests at heart. I never want to guide the ship. I know it's a group effort.\") \n\"I am of the thinking that everything happens as it should and when it should. Now it's my turn.\" As for that gentleman operating the photo booth. Metz laughs that he didn't recognize her at first, now that she's the star of a new show, one that happens to be the biggest hit of the fall season. \"He's like, 'Oh my God. It's you.'\" \nA version of this story first appeared in the Dec. 2 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. To receive the magazine, click here to subscribe .",

    "text": "Breaking a sweat? Researchers are creating a skin patch that can test those droplets while people exercise and beam results to their smartphones, possibly a new way to track health and fitness.\nThe experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it's almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin — and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona.\nGood vibrations: touch-based communication may be the future of wearable tech Wearable technology: Canada emerging as a global leader If you think of perspiration as just a drippy nuisance, think again.\n\"Sweat has biochemical components within it that tell us a lot about physiological health,\" said John A. Rogers, who directs Northwestern University's Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics and led the new research.\nToday's wearable technology helps people track their calories, activity and heart rate. A wearable biosensor would be \"radically different,\" Rogers said. \n'Such a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.' - Zhenan Bao, Stanford University For simple fitness purposes, it could give an early warning that it's time to replenish electrolytes before someone starts to feel dehydrated. But eventually, with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.\nRogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid.\nHow it works Stick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change colour to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration's acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate.\nTogether, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colours and interprets what they mean.\nIn two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers' team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches' performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today — taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory. For a more real-world test, the other 12 bicyclists wore the patches while competing in a long-distance outdoor race in Tucson.\nThe patches stayed in place and worked even in the challenging outdoor race, and the patches' biochemical test results agreed with the indoor bikers' conventional sweat tests, the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.\nDon't expect Fitbits to improve health, help drop pounds Do fitness trackers really change our behaviour? \"It seems really practical,\" said Stanford University chemical engineering professor Zhenan Bao, who also researches novel biomedical materials but wasn't involved with the sweat patch. By simply looking at a colour change, \"such a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.\"\nIt's a growing field: Other research groups around the country, including some of Bao's colleagues, are pursuing wearable biosensors.\nRogers' sweat patches are designed for one-time use over a few hours. While Wednesday's studies used an early version that analyzed sweat just once during the exercise, he's now testing a design capable of multiple measurements over time.\n\n© The Associated Press, 2016",

Related articles Marine Le Pen storms into the lead in French election polls \nProfessor Rasmus said: “They don’t really care how extreme some of their positions may be - we saw that with Trump. \n\"Nobody is going to vote for the Socialists. It’s really going to be Le Pen’s election to lose, I think.\" \nSpeaking about the political situation in France, Rasmus said: \"What you’ve got is a lot of working class and small business folks who are just fed up with the policies of the last decade, which have emphasised trade and tax benefits for the rich, the concentration of income and the loss of jobs with which people can sustain themselves. Nobody is going to vote for the Socialists.

John McCain's re-election campaign on Nov. 3, 2016, at Mesa's Sloan Park. (Photo: Tom Tingle/The Republic) \nU.S. Sen. Jeff Flake may have a long two years ahead of him. \nUp for re-election in 2018, the first-term Arizona Republican is already under attack from the right and the left. \nFlake repeatedly stood up this year to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, criticizing him over the tone and tenor of his campaign, as well as proposals such as Trump's plan to build a border wall and force Mexico to pay for it. \nHowever, Trump's upset victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8 has left Flake on the outside looking in, just as he enters his own campaign cycle. \n\"He called it wrong,\" said David Berman, an Arizona State University professor emeritus of political science and a senior research fellow at the Morrison Institute for Public Policy. \nIn addition to sparring with Trump , who called Flake \"weak and ineffective,\" the junior Arizona senator also has been at odds with anti-\"amnesty\" Republicans over his role in the \"Gang of Eight,\" a bipartisan group of senators who collaborated on a 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill that ultimately did not become law. Kelli Ward already running for Jeff Flake's Senate seat \nAnd he has been an ally of President Barack Obama on thawing the Cold War relationship between the United States and Cuba. \n\"I think he could probably get re-elected if he makes it through the primary — the primary is the real dangerous part there for him,\" Berman said. \nA post-election poll released earlier this month indicates that Flake could be vulnerable to a GOP primary challenge. \nThe automated telephone survey of 1,122 likely 2018 Republican primary voters found Flake tied with former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who announced in October that she is running for Flake's seat , and trailing state Treasurer Jeff DeWit, an ally of Trump who has been mentioned as a possible Flake challenger. \nAccording to the Nov. 15-16 poll from the Kansas City-based Remington Research Group, Flake and Ward are tied in a head-to-head match-up at 35 percent, with another 30 percent undecided. DeWit would lead Flake 42 percent to 33 percent with 25 percent undecided. \nIn a hypothetical three-way race, DeWit still would lead with 38 percent, followed by Flake at 30 percent, Ward at 15 percent and 17 percent undecided. \nThe poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.93 percentage points. Arizona picked Trump, but by a lot less than you might think \nRemington Research Group was founded by Jeff Roe, a political strategist who has been affiliated with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and whose Axiom Strategies did some consulting work for Ward in her ill-fated 2016 primary challenge to U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. \nTitus Bond, the pollster, said Remington has no ties to either DeWit or Ward, and only decided to poll Flake's re-election prospects because Flake's reputation as a high-profile Trump critic presented an \"interesting dynamic.\" \nIn an interview with The Arizona Republic , Flake shrugged off the survey as too early and said it's just a ritual that senators must go through at the start of their re-election cycles. \n\"Two years out, you take it for what it's worth,\" Flake said. \nFlake can take heart that an April 2014 poll conducted by pollster Kellyanne Conway, who later became Trump's presidential campaign manager, found McCain trailing then-Gov. Jan Brewer and U.S. Reps. Matt Salmon and David Schweikert in hypothetical 2016 primary contests. \nMcCain went on this year to easily beat Ward and conservative activist Clair Van Steenwyk in his primary and to win re-election by defeating U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, D-Ariz., in the general election. Trump's GOP: Republicans, even past critics, rally around President-elect Donald Trump \nFlake also is taking fire from liberal groups who may see Arizona as a 2018 pick-up opportunity. \nUltraviolet Action, an anti-sexism advocacy group, took out a full-page ad in Tuesday's Republic that ripped Flake over Stephen Bannon, the controversial Trump adviser. \n\"Trump appointed White supremacist, anti-Semite, and domestic abuser Steve Bannon to be his chief White House strategist,\" the ad says. \"And Senator Jeff Flake did nothing.\" \nThe Progressive Change Campaign Committee also called on Flake to denounce Bannon in a television commercial the organization said would run on Thanksgiving Day. \nFlake noted Bannon's White House is not subject to Senate confirmation and thus \"advise-and-consent doesn't apply to this position.\" \n\"I give the president wide deference on who he chooses,\" Flake said. \nNowicki is The Republic's national political reporter.

    "text": "Politics | Mon Nov 28, 2016 | 1:09pm EST Trump steps up search for secretary of state, to meet Petraeus FILE PHOTO - U.S. General David Petraeus, commander of the international security assistance force and commander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, testifies at a Senate Armed Services committee hearing on the situation in Afghanistan, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. March... REUTERS/Jason Reed By Steve Holland and David Brunnstrom | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON \nNEW YORK/WASHINGTON President-elect Donald Trump on Monday stepped up his search for a new U.S. secretary of state on Monday, with the focus on former CIA head David Petraeus who is a candidate despite admitting he shared classified information with his mistress. \nThe Republican was to meet Petraeus, a retired general, at Trump Tower in Manhattan in a new round of interviews. \nOnce the top U.S. military commander in Iraq and Afghanistan, Petraeus was sentenced to two years' probation and fined $100,000 last year for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified information. \nHe admitted sharing classified information with his biographer, with whom he was having an affair. The scandal forced Petraeus to resign from the CIA in 2012. \nPetraeus has also been mentioned as a possible new secretary of defense. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, is also holding talks with Mitt Romney on Tuesday in his second recent meeting with the 2012 Republican presidential nominee. \nU.S. Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani are also in the mix for the job of America's top diplomat, Trump aides say. \nTrump spokesman Jason Miller, asked if the president-elect was nearing the end of his search for a secretary of state, said Trump is using the interview process as he works toward a final decision on the position. \n\"He’ll complete that when he’s ready,\" Miller said. \"He’s going to pick the person that he thinks will do the absolutely best job.” \nPETRAEUS TROUBLES \nPetraeus' past mishandling of classified documents is unlikely to be an obstacle to him being offered a top government post, even though Trump harshly criticized Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the election campaign for using a private email server while she was secretary of state. \nTrump often compared the prosecution of Petraeus with the lack of legal action against Clinton, who was investigated by the FBI but never charged with any offense. \n\"Just based on his public statements, I think (Trump) sees Petraeus as a good man who made a mistake, who did a fraction of what other people have done and received a lot more punishment,\" said a source who has advised the transition team on national security. \nAmong the Trump transition team, Petraeus and Romney are supported by Republicans looking for a candidate with gravitas who can unify the party, the source said. \nGiuliani is favored by aides who worked on the election campaign while ideological conservatives are more inclined toward John Bolton, the former ambassador to the United Nations, the source said. Corker is well regarded but some in the Trump camp do not want too many senators coming into the Cabinet, the source said. \nTrump arrived back in New York on Sunday after several days in Florida for Thanksgiving. He caused a stir by on Sunday when he alleged on Twitter that “serious voter fraud” had occurred in the presidential election in New Hampshire, Virginia, and California -- states won by Clinton -- but provided no evidence to back his assertion. \nIn New Hampshire, the deadline to apply for a recount has already passed. Any strong evidence of widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire could still be investigated by the state’s attorney general, according to David Scanlan, the state’s deputy secretary of state. \nBut Scanlan emphasized that his office had not received reports of voter fraud on the scale alleged by Trump. “There’s no evidence that we’ve seen that supports claims like that. Voter fraud does occur, but it occurs in isolated instances,” he said. \nCalifornia Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud in California and elsewhere are absurd.\" \n(Additional reporting by Melissa Fares in New York and Julia Harte in Washington; Writing by Alistair Bell) Next In Politics",

    "text": "With 158 rushing yards, LeShun Daniels Jr. went over 1,000 for the season. Associated Press Box Score\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) - With a possible trip to the Big Ten championship game at stake, Nebraska fell flat.\nC.J. Beathard threw three touchdown passes and the Hawkeyes pummeled No. 17 Nebraska 40-10 on Friday, knocking the Cornhuskers out of Big Ten title contention and sending Wisconsin to the championship game.\nTommy Armstrong started for Nebraska (9-3, 6-3 Big Ten) despite a balky hamstring and was just 13 of 35 passing for 125 yards. Backup Ryker Fyfe, who broke his non-throwing wrist last week, didn't take a snap until the game had long been decided.\n\"Tommy wasn't 100 percent,\" Huskers coach Mike Riley said. \"I don't know if he was the healthiest...I don't know how much it would have made a difference (to play Fyfe).\"\nNebraska's defense was just as bad as its offense.\nLeShun Daniels Jr. ran for 158 yards and two scores and George Kittle caught two TD passes for the Hawkeyes (8-4, 6-3). They closed the regular season with three straight wins — two of them over ranked opponents — and scored their most points since a win over Purdue on Oct. 15.\nIowa broke open what was expected to be a tight game with a 75-yard TD run by Akrum Wadley and a 77-yard touchdown throw from Beathard to Riley McCarron in the first quarter.\n\"We played as good as we've played all year,\" Beathard said. \"It just shows the fight and the resilience of this team.\"\nThe Badgers are big favorites to beat Minnesota on Saturday anyway. But the Cornhuskers, who entered November as a legitimate playoff contender, hardly looked like one after being outscored 102-13 in their last two road games.\n\"We gave up big plays. I think we were horrible on third down,\" Riley said. \"I'm really disappointed all the way around in all of us.\"\nTHE TAKEAWAY\nNebraska: With so much to play for, it's hard to believe that the Cornhuskers played so, so poorly. Nebraska gave up three plays of over 50 yards, and Armstrong was all over the place. The Huskers have lost three of their last four to Iowa, a fate sealed when they ran into Iowa kicker Keith Duncan on a field goal try in the fourth quarter — allowing the Hawkeyes to go up 23 a few plays later.\nIowa: The Hawkeyes didn't make it to the Big Ten title game either. But they did go 6-3 in the league, an impressive feat for a team that lost to North Dakota State of the FCS in its final nonconference game. Iowa also made its case for a high-profile bowl, which looked iffy to say the least after losing by 27 points at Penn State to start this month. \"You learn a lot about yourself in November,\" Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said.\nB1G TITLE GAME UPDATE\nWisconsin gets the West's spot in Indianapolis next week because it beat Nebraska 23-17 (OT) in late October. In the East, Penn State might have the easiest path. The favored Nittany Lions need to beat Michigan State at home and hope favored Ohio State beats Michigan on Saturday. Ohio State needs a win and a Penn State loss — and even if the Nittany Lions take the East the Buckeyes should be in good shape for the playoff at 11-1. Michigan needs to upset the hated Buckeyes.\nEXTRA POINTS\nDaniels became the first Iowa rusher with over 1,000 yards since 2011. ...Armstrong's 13-yard TD pass to Stanley Morgan snapped a streak of over 136 minutes without allowing a touchdown for Iowa. The Hawkeyes shut out Illinois 28-0 last week. ... Wadley had 105 yards rushing on just 11 carries. ... Armstrong made his 44th career start, setting a team record for a quarterback. Taylor Martinez, his predecessor, made 43 career starts.\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\nNebraska likely stays in the Top 25. But the Huskers could find themselves drop a few spots after their second straight poor showing on the road. Iowa, which reached as high as 13th earlier this year, could sneak back after beating the Huskers and Michigan in November.\nUP NEXT\nNebraska will head to a decent bowl game just a year after sneaking into a bid with just five wins.\nIowa will find out which bowl game it will play in next Sunday.\nSeason Stats\nEdit",

    "text": "Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson on Saturday said he’s relieving the sergeant involved in the shooting death of a 19-year-old man of his police powers.\nIn a written statement emailed to the media, Johnson said he took the action because the department still has “many unanswered questions” about Wednesday night’s shooting in West Englewood.\nThe Cook County Medical Examiner’s office on Friday said an autopsy of Kajuan Raye showed he was killed by a gunshot in the back.\nJohnson said those preliminary findings along with the unsuccessful search for a weapon the sergeant said was displayed during the pursuit of Raye led to Saturday’s announcement.\n“Having been a police officer for 28 years, I know that this job is not easy and the decision to use force is extremely complex and must be made in seconds without the benefits of formal reviews and deliberations,” Johnson said in the statement.\n“However, based on the little information we know at this point, I have concerns about this incident and feel this decision is in the best interest of the department and the people of Chicago as we await a methodical and impartial investigation into exactly what transpired.”\nThe sergeant, who had already been put on desk duty, will continue to be paid but have to turn in his weapon and badge. Relieving an officer of police powers is the most serious action the police department can take during an open investigation.\nPolice say the sergeant had given chase, thinking Raye matched the description of a battery suspect. Police say Raye was shot after the teen twice appeared to point a gun at the pursuing officer. But no gun had been found at the shooting scene.\nDozens of family members and supporters gathered Friday near the scene of the shooting to remember Raye’s life and call for justice.\nRaye’s cousin, Ahkeya White, said the family was concerned about media attention paid to his prior arrest for theft, and said the teen was not doing anything wrong before police attempted to stop him Wednesday.\n“Everybody got a story. Everybody got something they don’t want to put on TV,” White said, tears streaming down her cheeks. “That moment … two nights ago, whatever he did, he wasn’t doing it then, when they shot him down. And that officer didn’t know him.”\nAbout 80 people crowded onto the sidewalk, some holding candles as they took turns at a microphone attached to a balky loudspeaker.\nFriends and relatives gathered for a vigil and balloon release at 65th and Ashland, near the site where Kajuan was shot and killed by Chicago police on Wednesday. The Cook County Medical Examiner’s office announced Friday that the 19-year-old died from a gunshot wound to the back. | Andy Grimm/Sun-Times\nJohnson said earlier in the week it was not clear if the officers involved in the chase and shooting were wearing body cameras, though the department announced in September that body cameras would be issued to all patrol officers in six police districts, including the 7th District-Englewood, where Raye was shot.\nA spokeswoman for the Independent Police Review Authority, the city agency that investigates police misconduct, said Thursday that officers in the 7th District had not yet been outfitted with body cameras.\nIPRA, the city agency which investigates police shootings and allegations of misconduct, is reviewing the shooting. Surveillance camera video from a church near the shooting scene shows Raye sprinting away from a police officer, who trails the teen by a a half-dozen yards. The footage does not capture the shooting.\nWhite, Raye’s cousin, addressed the prospect of the planned lawsuit in her remarks.\n“We all work. It ain’t about no money, we don’t need money. Whatever they give … it won’t bring him back,” White said. “We’re trying to move forward… we’re going to do it by the book.”\nRaye’s death was one of three fatal shootings by Chicago police officers in the last seven days, and the second in Englewood. Darius Dishaun Jones was gunned down in the 2000 block of West 69th Street, where police officers on patrol saw Jones shooting at a 26-year-old man. Police said officers opened fire after Jones ignored “repeated” orders to drop his weapon. Jones was pronounced dead at Advocate Christ Hospital. The man he allegedly shot suffered a wound to the abdomen, and was in critical condition.\nEarly Friday, police said 37-year-old Cleotha Mitchell was shot by an officer in the 600 block of Central Park Avenue in Homan Square, after Mitchell had fatally shot 35-year-old Jeffrey Banks.\nRaye’s mother, Karonisha Ramsey, said only a few sentences, thanking the crowd of mourners.\n“And as for my baby, I guess, we gonna get justice,” she said.\nIn a phone interview several hours before the vigil, Ramsey said Raye had called her Wednesday not long before he was shot, and she said he was on his way to her Dolton home for Thanksgiving dinner, which Ramsey has always cooked up on the Wednesday before the official holiday.\nRamsey said Raye had only recently moved back to Chicago after she had sent him to live with his aunt and grandmother in Texas. The teen had been unmotivated and his grades were slipping at Thorton Fractional High School, Ramsey said, and she hoped a change of scene would help him.\n“I just wanted to put him in a different environment,” Ramsey said. “He had perfect attendance (at Thorton), he just wasn’t doing the work.”\nRaye moved back when he turned 18, and while he wasn’t in school, Ramsey said she insisted that he start working toward getting his General Equivalency Diploma, and Raye was trying to get a job at Dominos Pizza, where his sister works. Someday, the teen hoped to become a veterinarian.\n“He just loved dogs, and he kept saying he wanted to be a veterinarian. All he watched was Animal Channel,” she said. “He was a happy person.

    "text": "Theodore Roosevelt on Criticizing the President The President-Reject A passage attributed to Theodore Roosevelt holds that it is unpatriotic, servile, and morally treasonable to proclaim that there must be no criticism of the President. - - \nClaim: Theodore Roosevelt said that speaking out against criticism of the President \"is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.\" True \nOrigin: In March 2003, Iraq was invaded by a U.S.-led coalition of forces mobilized by the George W. Bush administration on the grounds that Saddam Hussein's regime posed an imminent threat to world peace and stability. A large number of Americans remained unpersuaded by President Bush's justification for going to war, however, and thus his decision to do so was criticized before, during, and after the invasion took place. \nReflecting the growing political divide in the country, another segment of the American populace held that it was unpatriotic or even treasonous to speak out against someone who was leading the United States in a time of war. Critics fired back that far from being unpatriotic, it is one's patriotic duty to oppose a president whose policies put Americans in harm's way for no defensible reason. One way they attempted to claim the higher moral ground was by citing a quote attributed to the 25th U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt: \n“To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.” \n― Theodore Roosevelt \nThe passage is, in fact, from an editorial written by the former president in May 1918, when the U.S. was embroiled in World War I. Make no mistake, Roosevelt wasn't against the war — quite to the contrary, he believed the U.S. had entered it too reluctantly — but he was outspokenly critical of President Woodrow Wilson's conduct of the war, writing no fewer than two syndicated editorials a week over a two-year period advocating for a stronger U.S. presence on the European war front. \nRoosevelt's criticisms led to accusations of \"disloyalty\" on his part, and worse. Ralph Stout, managing editor of The Kansas City Star , took note of the vehemence the attacks on Roosevelt: \nColonel Roosevelt's criticisms of the Administration were not widely popular. The Star never had any idea they would be popular, but it believed they were right and for the real good of the country. As he had foreseen when the connection was made, \"Many of your subscribers will be perfectly furious at The Star for printing my editorials.\" They were. They wrote to The Star to denounce the Colonel for writing the articles and The Star for printing them. In popular discussion in the Middle West forms of disapproval ranged from \"He should stand by the President\" to \"He should be stood before a stone wall and shot.\" \nIt was comments like these, exacerbated by suggestions from elements within the Wilson administration that Roosevelt's views ought somehow to be suppressed, that prompted him to craft this high-minded rebuttal: \nThe President is merely the most important among a large number of public servants. He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct, his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal, able, and disinterested service to the Nation as a whole. Therefore it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts, and this means that it is exactly necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right. Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and servile. To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else. \n— The Kansas City Star , 18 May 1918 \nNearly 100 years after this, the passage was used to defend critics not only of President George W. Bush, but of President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump, as well. Originally published: 22 November 2016 sources: \nRoosevelt, Theodore. Roosevelt in The Kansas City Star .

    "text": "‘G ood news for Europe,” read the first line of the analyst note . If I tell you it was from an investment bank that backed eurozone austerity to the hilt, you might guess what the good news is. Yes, François Fillon (the French Thatcher) stands poised for a runoff with Marine Le Pen (the French Mussolini) in next year’s presidential election.\nWhat could be better news for the investment banking community than having all non-fascist voters, left right and centre, obligated to vote for a politician who wants to slash the welfare state, sack workers and extend the working day?\nBerenberg, the German private bank that issued the note, could not wait to celebrate Fillon’s success in the primary. “With luck,” its chief economist, Holger Schmieding, assured clients, “2017 could be more of an opportunity … than a risk.” The “opportunity” is for a Fillon government, with no credible socialist opposition, to enact “pro-growth” measures – attacking wages, hours and welfare, and enriching the people who hold €40bn in the private bank. It is symptomatic of the huge political miscalculation that the European political elite is making.\nThe European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told an Austrian newspaper on Sunday that there would be no letup on federalising Europe; no national opt-outs from the stagnation economics administered from Brussels.\nNext Sunday, we get to see whether European centrism’s “double-or-quits” strategy will pay off. In Austria , where far-right populist Norbert Hofer is neck and neck with a Green candidate in the re-run of the election for the ceremonial presidency role, the left and centre are frantically trying to mobilise party-loyal working-class voters. They may fail.\nFrançois Fillon is as big a threat to liberal values as Marine Le Pen | Natalie Nougayrède Read more \nIn Italy, on the same day, the centre-left government looks set to lose a referendum designed to strengthen the power of the executive over parliament. If the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, steps down as a result, and Europe imposes a bank rescue plan that raids ordinary people’s savings, then you could get both a domestic banking and a eurozone crisis by Christmas.\nTo complete the pattern of wilful idiocy the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to Greek government sources, chose this week to press Greece for yet more public spending cuts – on pain, again, of the enforced collapse of its banking system. Oblivious to the neo-Nazi assaults on migrant camps in the Greek islands, the IMF in Washington – like the commission and the ECB – can only see rules and balance sheets.\nIt feels, in short, as if the European centrist elite has developed a death wish. And once you understand European culture this morbid possibility is not so far-fetched.\nIn his 1912 novel Death in Venice, Thomas Mann portrays the death-wish of cosmopolitan European culture through the love-obsession of a sick old man. The protagonist, Aschenbach, checks himself into a cosmopolitan hotel in plague-ridden Venice, to fulfil his wish to die. Writing two years before European cosmopolitanism did indeed die, Mann was already on top of the reasons why it might.\nIn the novel, city authorities deny the existence of the plague – and, in so doing, create the conditions for its spread. Often read simply as a parable about love and loss, the novel in fact deals explicitly with the self-destructiveness of what Mann called the “European soul”. Mann’s settings in this and other novels – the Lido hotel, the Swiss sanatorium – emphasise the fragility of a transnational culture once crisis breaks out.\nFor Mann, the carefully crafted polycultural world of the hotel lobby – where the Poles speak French, the Italians dress in Parisian fashion, and the band plays selections from Hungarian operetta – is a fragile illusion. When just one piece of it falls apart, everything does.\nToday our polyculturality is not so fragile as in the belle epoque. The Schengen freedoms are, for white people at least, real. The Erasmus programme, the EU’s student-exchange project, cross-pollinated the lives of more than three million students. Alongside the staid and worthy “city of culture” programme, Europe’s young people have been creating the real thing: in the Berlin arts scene, in massive music festivals such as Benicasim in Spain, in the wild nightlife of contemporary Belgrade.\nBut even this grassroots culture of globalisation is breakable, if you try hard enough – because it can only exist in a space sealed off from official politics. At the typical European bar, beach or coffee shop, tolerance exists because educated people leave their nationality and religion at the door. The assumption among the young – implicit but strong – is that all politics is bullshit and does not matter.\nNow politics and nationality have begun hammering on the door. And initially they have produced mainly paralysis and fear.\nWhen I asked the young people I met in Ferrara, in northern Italy , in September how they would respond to the new xenophobic wave, many spoke about “ genuino clandestino ” – a back-to-the-land movement that advocates disconnection with the official economy as a survival strategy against austerity.\n“It’s over, it’s impossible, the right has won,” are responses you will hear everywhere among the young, once you stop speaking to activists and listen to small-town kids wasting away their 20s in their grandmother’s spare room.\nSo Fillon v Le Pen is not “good news for Europe”. Neither is Juncker’s promise to double down on all the mistakes that led us here; nor the IMF’s insistence that Greece should destroy its democracy some more; nor Renzi’s decision to play shit or bust with the Italian banking system.\nThis is no longer a confident, transnational elite, revelling in Samuel Huntingdon’s famous description of national governments as “residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite’s global operations”. And they are now up against a far-right international movement – Trump, Farage, the Breitbart media folks – whose coherence waxes as the globalists’ coherence wanes.\nWe can stop this. But only if we reject the incessant demand for austerity, privatisation, longer hours, lower wages and the theft of a young generation’s future. That’s why the centre-left, in the short time available, must find the French people somebody better than Fillon.",

    "text": "shares \nIn 2014, Kenyan teenager Caroline Wambui lost her uncle after he suffered kidney failure. \nNobody in her family was a match for a donation, and Kenya, like so many other African countries, lacks an official countrywide organ donor program. Organ donation has in fact become somewhat of a taboo. \nIn the meantime, individual’s like Caroline’s uncle die unnecessarily, or are forced to turn to an unregulated and unsafe market that has sprung up around organ donation in reaction to the country’s health inefficiencies. \nOne area in which Kenya is developing, however, is in terms of ICT, and this is gradually creeping into schools. The government has launched a laptops for schools policy, while numerous multinationals and local startups are developing solutions whereby the country’s education sector is improved by technology. \nCaroline, fresh from losing her uncle, was a beneficiary of this movement. So much so, that within two years of his death she has rolled out her own solution to the problem he faced – Life Pocket. \nA mobile app, Life Pocket connects patients with donors, doctors and hospitals. All are able to register on the platform, with the aim of connecting patients and donors in a way that has previously proven impossible. It is currently being piloted by a number of hospitals across the country, ahead of a nationwide rollout in October. \nCaroline said Life Pocket also aims to raise awareness about donating organs and stop it from being a taboo subject. She said, \nThe app has a feature that contains all organs, where one can learn more about donating and whether or not it would have any negative effect on the health of the donor. \nIt also has features like a forum, where different donors and recipients can interact with doctors in varied fields of health expertise. Organ recipients can also share their journey milestones before and after donation. \nShe said she cannot wait to see the app fully rolled out, and hopes it prevents others having to experience what her uncle went through. \nYet Life Pocket seemed a long way from being developed until Damaris Mutati, Caroline’s teacher at Embakasi Girls Secondary School, began to introduce technology to her students, something she feels is vital to the development of young people on the continent. \nAs Demaris points out, \nTechnology is important to the lives of young Africans and being in a developing continent it needs more job creators than seekers. \nThis can only be achieved if schools integrate more ICT skills into their curriculum as well as encourage young people to be developers of their own ideas, and consumers of their own technological products. This then would create more employment opportunities for the young people across the continent. \nThis has certainly proven the case with Caroline, who also roped in a number of friends to help her develop Life Pocket. So passionate was Mutati on the subject, meanwhile, that she participated in two programs run by multinational tech firm Intel in Kenya. The programs – Teach, and She Will Connect – were aimed at helping teachers pass on IT knowledge to children. NAIROBI, KENYA – NOVEMBER 6 : DAMARIS, CAROLINE, AND SEVERAL STUDENTS WORKING ON APP IN COMPUTER LAB IN EMBAKASI GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL IN MUKURU AREA. Photo by Guillaume Bonn/ Getty Images Assignment for intel \nIntel’s involvement went deeper, however, with staff volunteering to teach a coding workshop at Caroline’s school, where the pupils were introduced to Intel XDK. Intel XDK is a unified development environment that enables users to design, create, test and deploy HTML5 apps. \nThis proved the inspiration for Caroline to build her app, with the schoolgirl saying the input of the company was critical. \nMany more young girls can successfully follow in my footsteps if they are exposed to programming. \nThis is something that Intel agrees with. According to Rosalind Hudnell, vice president of worldwide corporate affairs and president of the Intel Foundation, the company’s She Will Connect program is dedicated to closing the internet gender gap that exists in many developing countries. \nThe initiative has resonated with people because it empowers young women and opens up opportunity to acquire or improve digital literacy skills and expand their understanding and use of technology. \nThrough this, women can then more easily connect to resources that enable them to receive a better education, enhance their political participation, have a stronger voice in their communities, and increase their income by connecting to new economic opportunities. \nShe said Mutati, who went through the program and decided to integrate technology and coding into her classroom, was a perfect example of this. \nHudnell said, \nCaroline’s story is just one of many. The results we’ve seen just in the last two years have been amazing. \nAs technology continues to advance, it will only become more important to make sure that Africa’s innovators have access to the latest tools and resources. In the coming years, this will be our focus – to ensure that people like Damaris and Caroline are empowered to reach their full potential through technology.",

    "text": "WWE are asking fans if they want to see Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg 3 Published 24/7 \nFollowing Goldberg’s relatively quick destruction of Brock Lesnar at the Survivor Series pay-per-view, attention is already turning to 2017 where the two icons are reportedly set to meet for the third time. \nGoldberg is already 2-0 up against The Beast Incarnate, adding last weekend’s win to his WrestleMania XX victory, as both men went on to leave the company following an underwhelming match. 2-0 AGAINST THE BEAST \nHowever, with Goldberg sticking around, it’s expected that the Royal Rumble match will be used as a platform for Lesnar to cost him the chance to win, and set up a third and final encounter at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer? Sign up now and submit a 250-word test article: http://gms.to/haveyoursay4 Article continues below \nThe WWE have now taken an interesting tactic to see whether its fans will be interested to see a third battle between the pair, with some slightly surprising results. \nWWE.com ran a poll over the weekend , giving fans two options to share their opinion on whether the match is something they'd want to see again. Article continues below Arjen Robben has named his dream XI and it’s ridiculously attack-minded \nIt was a simple yes or no question; whether fans did want to see what an angry Lesnar does in his response to his loss at Survivor Series, or whether Goldberg being 2-0 up already means there's nothing left to prove. \nThe WWE often run polls on their Twitter account, asking fans whether they enjoyed an episode of Monday Night Raw, or NXT, for example. \nSometimes, they take the feedback and change certain things, so it remains to be seen whether they take fan input into question here as 47% of the fans that voted don’t want to see them compete against each other again. GOLDBERG VS. LESNAR 3? \nEven if it isn’t against Lesnar, Goldberg could still stick around if he receives the same amount of money he did for Survivor Series. \nOn The Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Dave Meltzer noted: “The situation is, [Bill] Goldberg got a deal from WWE to do one show, and it was a real big money deal. \n“The impression I’ve got is that he will wrestle as many times for that figure, as many times as Vince [McMahon] wants him to wrestle. \n“So the ball’s in Vince’s court. It’s not like [Goldberg] is going in there and saying. ’I’m ready to retire.’ If they meet his number, he’ll be there. So, it’s up to Vince.” \nSeth Rollins has also been touted as a potential opponent for Goldberg, but with Vince and the WWE going all in on this feud, it doesn’t seem like fan reaction will deter them from their long-term plans. \nDo you want to see Goldberg vs. Brock Lesnar 3?

    "text": "Nandan Nilekani had unsuccessfully fought on Congress ticket in 2014 General Election. But, in a bipartisan manner, Nilekani credited both the UPA and Modi government for India’s march towards digitisation. (Source: Facebook) Nandan Nilekani, former Chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India, is confident that demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will help India achieve in 3-6 months what it could have done in 3-6 years in terms of the digitisation of Indian economy for financial services.\nNilekani, who was roped in as the chairman of UIDAI by the UPA government, has always batted for cashless transactions and digitisation of the Indian economy. He believes that the sudden “shock” of demonetisation announced by PM Modi on November 8, would leapfrog Indian Economy into a digitised cashless economy in the next 3-6 months.\n“From my perspective, the shock to the system, I think, will give a big boost to digitisation. In the last seven years, the infrastructure for digital financial services — Aadhar, UPI the JAM infrastructure, USSD and micro-ATMs — have been laid down. What, I thought, would take 3-6 years to roll out, I now believe that, with the urgency of the matter, will happen in 3-6 months,” Nilekani said in an interview with NDTV on Monday.\nExplaining his “theory” further, the co-founder of Infosys said that India is going to see a “massive acceleration of the digitisation of Indian economy for financial services” in the next 3-6 months.\nFor instance, he said India has about 1-1.5 million PoS (point of sale) machines installed in the last 30-40 years. The PoS machine allows card-based transactions. He said the number of PoS would “double or triple in the next 3-6 months.”\nSimilarly, there are about 130000 micro-ATMs, which allows people to do cashless transactions in rural areas. The number of micro-ATMS would also increase up to a million or more, he told the channel.\nTalking about the pain caused to scores of people, especially the poor and daily wagers, who are still not part of the formal economy, Nilekani said, “There will definitely be some amount of short-term pain in the coming weeks. But you are going to see that this acceleration is going to benefit everybody.”‘\nDespite the “pain”, he said, “you are going to see very high financial inclusion.”",

According to WJZ-TV , protesters had taken to the streets on a cold afternoon to protest an officer-involved shooting. The protester, whose identity has not been revealed, was present with her 1-year-old daughter. \nAt some point during the protests, the woman entered a local pizzeria with her baby to try to get warm, then went back outside to join the protest. According to the pizzeria owner, Antonio Romeo, she re-entered a second time and declared that her baby was having trouble breathing. Surveillance video released of the incident shows customers calling 911 to get medical assistance. \nMajor Richard Gibson, the commander of the Baltimore Police Northern District, happened to be on patrol keeping an eye on the protesters when he got the call. Surveillance video shows the obviously distraught officer rushing into the restaurant and administering CPR for several minutes until the paramedics arrived. Tragically, the young girl never was able to resume breathing and was pronounced dead at a local hospital. \nHowever, Gibson’s attempts were not lost on the onlookers, many of whom participated in the protest, according to WJZ: \n“It was unbelieveble. Very good man, to do what he’s done. You know don’t care about the people [outside], just take care of the baby,” said Romeo. \n“I’ve got a lot of respect. He’s done a very good job. I’m sorry the baby lost her life,” said Romeo. \nPolice sources tell WJZ Maj. Gibson is very involved in the community. After the incident happened, he and the officers reportedly ordered pizza for the crowd that was protesting against police. \nIt is not clear at this time what caused the baby’s death or whether she had any pre-existing medical conditions.",

    "text": "Karl B. DeBlaker/ AP Images \nThe Panthers are a curious case. Last season they racked up a franchise record 103 points, and Gallant, who signed a contract extension in January, was runner-up for the Jack Adams Award for best coach. This year, they’re underachieving with an 11-10-1 start, but the likes of Jonathan Huberdeau, Jussi Jokinen, Nick Bjugstad, and Alex Petrovic have missed time with injury. Advertisement \nIt’s very unclear what to make of the Panthers this season, but I can think of a handful of NHL coaches who deserved to be fired before Gallant. (Which in itself isn’t a reason not to fire him, mind you.) \nGallant is beloved by his players, but he’s clashed with management over roster moves and organizational philosophies, and this deeper dispute no doubt had more to do with his firing than the slow start. While it’s far too simplistic to lay this on the fundamental differences between an analytically minded front office and an old-school head coach, it’s not wrong to describe it that way either. \nThe Panthers will now have the chance to implement their philosophies top-down, as GM Tom Rowe has been named interim coach. Maybe it’ll work. (Or maybe they’ll start winning when they get healthy, and that would’ve happened under Gallant anyway.) Still, this is very curious timing for a coach firing, and the visuals could not be shittier.",

    "text": "Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu Compared Demonetisation With A Social Movement That Killed Millions RIP irony.   Adnan1 Abidi / Reuters Venkaiah Naidu (L) and Narendra Modi at a meeting in New Delhi May 18, 2009. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi ADVERTISEMENT \nSince Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his government's decision to demonetise ₹500 and ₹1,000 notes, politicians from the ruling government as well as from the Opposition have been busy defending and damning it respectively. \nFrom Finance Minister Arun Jaitley calling it a \"minor inconvenience\" to PM Modi laughing at the trials of the common people faced with severe cash crunch during the wedding season, the responses have ranged from ironic to insensitive. (The prime minister later made amends for sniggering at the public by shedding tears on camera .) \nSweeping executive decisions that affect public life are not unknown in the history of Indian politics. The anarchy that demonetisation has unleashed, causing death and untold suffering, has been compared, quite rightly so, to the dark days of the Emergency imposed by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, when severe restrictions on public and press freedoms prevailed. But the strangest response came from one of Modi's own Cabinet members, Information and Broadcasting Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu. \nIn an impassioned article in The Indian Express this morning, Naidu drew parallels between Modi's revolutionary bid to clean up the Indian economy and Cultural Revolution -- a term that harks back to one of the bloodiest phases of modern history. \nREAD: The 'New Normal' Has Been Around Long Before Donald Trump Or Demonetisation \nPredictably, just when observers of Indian politics think irony has died, it somehow manages to resurrect itself from the ashes like a Phoenix and take flight into the realm of the absurd. \nThe Cultural Revolution , which was launched in 1966 by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Party of China, is remembered as an example of extreme dictatorship, resulting in the death of anything between 500,000 and 2 million people. Jason Lee / Reuters A statue of late Chairman Mao Zedong is pictured at Beijing University of Chemical Technology in Beijing, China, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo \nTomes have been written documenting the horrors of Mao's grand plan to reinvent society by hammering into ordinary citizens the first principles of his peculiar variety of socialism. Driven by the ardour of his vision, the notorious Red Guards and a large section of the students took up arms against the bourgeoisie, to clean up the evils of capitalism, but eventually pushed the entire population into hunger, stagnation and poverty. At the peak of the unrest, at least 1,800 people died in Beijing in the months of August and September 1966 alone. \nFrom 1968 onward, Mao tried to reign in the escalating violence, but by then it had gone on for far too long to be successfully contained. The official handbook of the Cultural Revolution -- popularly called the \"Little Red Book\" -- was in wide circulation, with over a billion copies printed in the 1960s. A reign of terror had taken hold of the country well and truly. Predictably, just when observers of Indian politics think irony has died another day, it somehow manages to resurrect itself from the ashes like a Phoenix and take flight into the realm of the absurd. \nAlthough the revolution saw its course long back, it ended, officially, with Mao's death in 1976, a decade after it had begun. Its aftermaths are still felt, through forms of oppression that have morphed over the years and continue to blight China's human rights records till date. \nTo invoke this grisly, undemocratic and violently anti-people moment from the dark depths of world history in order to justify a seemingly pro-people policy decision makes the I&B minister's elaborate justification appear shockingly ill-informed. \nAlso on HuffPost",

On her web site , O'Donnell responded to critics by saying she didn't make the comment due to her infamously sour relationship with Donald Trump, but instead to raise awareness about autism. \nScientific American describes the condition here: \nAutism is a severe disorder that first appears in infancy. Individuals with autism are characterized by problems with language, social bonding and imagination. All suffer from serious communication deficits, and some are mute. They do not establish close relationships with others, preferring to remain in their own mental worlds. \nThe video shows clips edited together of Barron appearing to engage in certain, specific behaviors and uses these cherry-picked clips as \"proof\" that he has autism.

    "text": "Rec Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports What started as a Raiders romp ended as one of the best games of Week 12. The Raiders held off a furious comeback from the Panthers to secure a 35-32 win and their first winning season since 2002. Cam Newton and company roared back against the Raiders in the second half after falling behind 24-7 on a Khalil Mack pick-six before intermission . They promptly reeled off 25 straight points. With a pretty 44-yard touchdown pass to Kelvin Benjamin, the Panthers led 32-24 after kicking an extra point. The game pivoted on a gruesome injury to Derek Carr. The Raiders quarterback suffered what appeared to be a dislocated pinky on a snap-gone-wrong, forcing him to sit out a series while backup Matt McGloin entered the game. The Raiders went three-and-out on McGloin’s possession, the Carr threw an interception on his first possession back, setting up the Panthers on the Raiders’ 28-yard line for an eventual lead-taking touchdown. After a disastrous first half in which he went 3-for-12 passing for 18 yards and a pick-six, Newton bounced back to throw two touchdown passes. As the Panthers made their comeback, however, they repeatedly failed to convert after their touchdowns. They got their second point-after kick attempt block, then went 0-for-2 on 2-point conversion attempts as they chased the lost point on their next two touchdowns. On the Panthers second 2-point attempt, the Greg Olsen made an egregious drop. The lost points proved huge. Facing an 8-point deficit instead of a 11-point deficit, the Raiders marched 75 yards in 10 plays to score what would be the game-tying touchdown. Carr hit tight end Clive Walford for a 12-yard score, then Seth Roberts for the 2-point conversion. Beyond the interception, Carr was effective after the pinky injury. With a glove on his hand, he hooked hit Michael Crabtree for a 49-yard gain as part of a scoring drive to retake the lead with under two minutes remaining in the game. The Raiders had to settle for a field goal when an open Crabtree stumbled at the goal line on what could have been a touchdown pass. In this Storystream",

    "text": "One Obstacle to Curing Cancer: Patient Data Isn’t Shared Loading... \nScientific efforts to find cures for cancer will be severely hampered if the scientific community does not change the ways in which patient data is collected, shared, and analyzed. The development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies — the two biggest hopes for cancer cures — depend on the existence of large data sets comprising patients’ genetic and clinical information. Today, that data is fragmented and guarded in silos. Indeed, the well-kept secret in the cancer space is that progress in finding cures is being impeded as much by the lack of sharing by the players in the precision medicine ecosystem as it is by the stubbornness of the underlying science. \nWith about 20,000 genes and a total of 3 billion base pairs, finding the mutations responsible for a particular cancer is a daunting task. The larger the sets of data that contain the genomes of numerous patients, the higher the chances of finding deviations that are statistically significant. Only after this can the scientists begin their work of developing targeted therapies to overcome the effects of the mutated genes. \nThis is where the cancer ecosystem comes into play. Today, the clinical and genetic information of cancer patients is held in a variety of places: academic medical centers, community hospitals, disease-specific foundations, pharmaceutical companies, and the government. There is very little sharing of data among these institutions. Insight Center Sponsored by Medtronic Exploring cutting edge ways to lower costs and improve quality. \nLet’s begin with the academic medical centers, which are the most likely to collect genetic information on their patients. (Many of them are sequencing the genomes of all of their cancer patients.) The reasons they don’t share data lies in the nature of academic medicine. Doctors in academic centers are promoted for their research. Having exclusive use of their own data is crucial for gaining credit for research and obtaining grant money. Add to this the fact that many academic centers often cover the expenses of sequencing the genomes of their cancer patients themselves and you can understand their reluctance to share data. \nThe motivations of the pharmaceutical companies are similar: Why share data that may be critical to obtaining exclusive, patentable breakthroughs? \nThe community hospitals, which treat over 70% of all cancer patients, have vast amounts of clinical data but historically have not sequenced many of their patients. Similarly, the disease-specific foundations, whose interests are most aligned with those of patients, typically do not collect genomic data of their constituents. The few who do incur significant costs. For example, the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation spent over $40 million to collect genomic and clinical information on 1,200 multiple myeloma patients throughout their experience with the disease. The foundation has been exemplary in this regard, and its work over the past 20 years has been instrumental in leading to the development of 10 new drugs for treating multiple myeloma that have helped to triple the life expectancy of newly diagnosed patients. But there are roughly 100,000 multiple myeloma patients and only about 20% are involved with the foundation. The data of the other 80% resides in numerous silos. \nWhat is needed is to reshape the precision medicine ecosystem into one in which data is regularly shared and large data sets are stored in open-access portals available to researchers around the world. The opportunities for patentable discoveries will still exist and will actually be enhanced by the larger data sets, and most important, patients will be helped by the more rapid discovery of desperately needed therapies. \nFortunately, some efforts to reform the ecosystem are underway. Some are being spearheaded by the U.S. government both in the Obama administration’s Precision Medicine Initiative , which aims to collect genetic information of 1 million individuals, as well as Vice President Joe Biden’s Cancer Moonshot initiative . But there are also important private initiatives: the Genomic Data Commons out of the University of Chicago, the Collaborative Cancer Cloud launched by Intel and Oregon Health & Science University, and the Oncology Research information Exchange (ORIEN) — all of which are collecting data from multiple sources, normalizing it, and beginning to make it available in an open-access manner. To give just one example, both the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation and Flatiron Health have deposited their data on the Genomic Data Commons, thus doubling the size of the data available on multiple myeloma. \nWhile all these efforts are commendable, much more needs to be done. Indeed, one of the primary objectives of the recently launched Harvard Business School Kraft Precision Medicine Accelerator , which we cochair, is to make the broader health community aware of the existing efforts to increase the sharing of data and to get more institutions to join them. Toward that end, we encourage business leaders, many of whom serve on the boards of hospitals and medical foundations, to insist that these organizations start making their patient data available to the broader research community. \nThe HBS Kraft Accelerator also hopes to enlist patients in the cause. They can play a lead role in bringing about these changes. Today, there is little patient awareness of how critical it is to have their cancer tissue genetically sequenced and to have their clinical and genomic data released for inclusion in larger databases. Doing so would not only aid new drug discovery but would also help patients know which treatment approaches are most likely to be effective and which clinical trials are targeted to their specific mutations. Of course, privacy safeguards need to be put in place. \nWhile it is generally unknown, all of us have the right under HIPAA regulations to request that our medical records be released in anonymized form for research purposes. Unfortunately, few providers make their patients aware of this right. There is a glaring need for patients to be made aware of this. This is one of the main goals of the HBS Kraft Accelerator. \nEfforts like these are likely to improve the ways the members of the precision medicine ecosystem cooperate. But for patients like the two of us — one a survivor of a curable cancer and the other living with a cancer for which there still is no cure — time is of the essence. Accelerating the pace of change is something all of us can help accomplish. Richard G.

    "text": "IT HAS a day spa named after Ivanka and a Presidential Suite to die for.\nBut the Trump International Hotel could bring the real estate mogul’s time in the Oval Office to an abrupt end.\nA Harvard Law professor says President-elect Donald Trump could be impeached the moment he takes office over comments made to foreign diplomats.\nDuring a gathering at his new, spare-no-expense hotel in Washington DC, Mr Trump wined and dined visiting officials in the opulence of the hotel’s Lincoln Library, a junior ballroom with 16-foot ceilings and velvet drapes.\nEthical concerns were raised after a number of delegates admitted they would be tempted to stay at the hotel when visiting the US capital, in a bid to curry favour with the President.\n“Believe me, all the delegations will go there,” one Middle Eastern diplomat told the Washington Post.\n“Why wouldn’t I stay at his hotel blocks from the White House, so I can tell the new president, ‘I love your new hotel!’ Isn’t it rude to come to his city and say, ‘I am staying at your competitor?’” said another.\nmedia_camera Mr Trump has been urged to divest ownership of his new hotel. Picture: Chip Somodevilla\nMr Trump built the hotel inside the former Post Office Pavilion, which his company leased from the US Federal Government in a 60-year deal worth $US180 million.\nCommentators have flagged this as an “unprecedented and intolerable” conflict of interest that puts the integrity of federal procurement at risk, calling on Mr Trump to step down from running his company or for the government to terminate the lease.\nBut a more dramatic conclusion could be in order, with legal experts backing the possibility that the hotelier could face impeachment when he becomes President in January.\nRichard Painter, a University of Minnesota law professor who served as chief ethics counsel to President George W Bush, believes that Trump breached the US Constitution by schmoozing with diplomats at his swanky hotel.\nThe officials’ attempt to get on Trump’s good side by staying in his hotel “looks like a gift,” Prof Painter told ThinkProgress, which argued that the President-elect was “actively soliciting business from agents of foreign governments”.\nmedia_camera “Why would you stay anywhere else?” Picture: Supplied\nAnd toning down his approach one in office would not save Mr Trump, the analysis said, because “the message that diplomats can earn the favour of the new president by staying in his hotels has already been received, and it can’t exactly be unsaid”.\nThinkProgress argues that this would breach the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which states that federal officials may only do business with foreign government if they do not receive “special treatment”, Prof Painter said.\nHarvard Professor of Constitutional Laurence Tribe weighted in on Twitter, backing the ThinkProgress analysis. If Mr Trump was impeached, Vice President-elect Mike Pence would take his place as President.\nIt is not the first time impeachment has been raised in regards to Mr Trump; A law professor at the University of Utah has argued that the Trump University debacle alone is enough to impeach him on.\nArticle II of the US Constitution provides that the President “shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours”.\nBut, unless some kind of Republican conspiracy is afoot, it is unlikely to happen before 2018, since the GOP will control both the House of Representatives and the Senate when Mr Trump takes office.\nmedia_camera The Trump clan could rake in extra cash because of their patriarch’s job. Pic: Getty\nHOW IS A PRESIDENT IMPEACHED?\nHere’s the full section from Article II of the US Constitution:\n“The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanours.”\nSo the President is sackable. If Mr Trump did something outrageous enough to justify his removal from office, there is a constitutional mechanism that could make it happen.\nWe’re fairly sure Mr Trump hasn’t committed treason or bribery, so that leaves “other high crimes and misdemeanours” as the possible justification for his impeachment. The definition of that is pretty vague.\nSay, hypothetically, Mr Trump has done something appropriately awful. The next step is for the House of Representatives to pass articles of impeachment with a simple majority. At that point, the President has officially been impeached.\nThen he faces a trial in the Senate, presided over by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. At the moment, that’s Justice John Roberts, who was appointed by George W. Bush. At the end of the trial the Senate votes, and a two-thirds majority is required for a conviction.\nIf he’s convicted, the President is removed from office. In this case, that would result in Mike Pence becoming the new President.\nmedia_camera Mr Trump would put up a fight.\nIT’S HAPPENED BEFORE\nTwo previous presidents have been impeached. The first, Andrew Johnson, was tried for violating the Tenure of Office Act, and acquitted in 1868. It was as boring as it sounds. The second, Bill Clinton, was impeached on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in the wake of the Lewinsky scandal, and was also acquitted.\nRichard Nixon was almost impeached over Watergate, but resigned as president before the necessary resolutions could pass in the House of Representatives.\nSo, there is precedent here. But ultimately, the probability of a push for impeachment succeeding is dependent on public opinion.\n“Ninety-nine per cent of the game is how popular is the president,” Bruce Fein, who was involved in the Clinton impeachment, told Politico in April. If President Trump’s approval rating is high, no one will dare to move against him.\ndana.mccauley@news.com.au\nTrump outlines his plans for the U.S in first interview 0:30 Donald Trump has revealed his plans on removing criminals from the US in his first interview.

    "text": "'Apprentice' cast say Trump is a sexist pig \nDonald Trump’s stunning win in the 2016 presidential election has sparked a global spike in interest in old episodes of “The Apprentice,” a data analytics firm has found. \nPeople around the world are looking to the show, which ran on NBC for 14 seasons over more than a decade, to get some clues about the kind of person Trump will be as leader of the free world come inauguration day. \nWared Seger, the co-founder of Parrot Analytics, a measurement company that helps international TV executives gauge interest in TV properties, told The Post that over the past three months, audience demand for “The Apprentice,” has quadrupled. \nThe show’s demand index rose significantly when the President-elect won the primaries — then again on Sept. 11 and when he won the election earlier this month. \nParrot Analytics’ demand index draws data from video streaming services, Wikipedia searches, file sharing sites, searches, social media commentary and blogs. \nA surge in value for the library of “The Apprentice” and “Celebrity Apprentice” could be a financial boon for both Trump and MGM as both own the archive along with the series creator Mark Burnett. \nMGM and Mark Burnett have been fielding a huge number of calls about ways to extend the franchise and for straight sales to broadcasters, a source close to the property confirmed. Photo: AP \n“There are plans to exploit different things,” said a person familiar with ‘The Apprentice.” \n“There’s been a lot of global interest,” the person said. “With a great format like that there are always opportunities for exploiting it further. The demand is huge.” \n“Celebrity Apprentice,” is currently airing on streaming video service, Hulu. “The New Celebrity Apprentice,” hosted by Arnold Schwarzenegger, begins in January on NBC. \nTrump, who will become the 45th president of the Uniter States on Jan. 20, has been under fire for potential conflicts of interest with his Trump Organization, a sprawling real estate and licensing firm. \nTrump was represented during the long run of “The Apprentice” by several talent agencies, including William Morris Agency and Endeavor which later merged to become WME. \nOn Sunday, WME boss Ari Emanuel visited Trump in New Jersey but the two are said to have not discussed business, according to sources. \nWME acquired the Miss Universe Organization from the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization and a rep for MGM did not immediately respond for comment. Share this: ",

    "text": "Queen's University students who attended a controversial costume party  last weekend could be punished for violating the school's code of conduct  — a set of rules implemented by many universities that includes off-campus, non-academic behaviour.\nBut Timothy Boyle, a Calgary-based lawyer who has represented students involved in university disciplinary cases, said many schools may be extending their authority too far.\n\"Fair enough they have certain standards to expect of you as a student while you're on campus,\" he said. \"But now ... they want to extend themselves past their university boundaries and start regulating [students'] affairs while they are off campus. That has to be a great concern.\"\n​ Daniel Woolf, principal and vice chancellor of Queen's University, has said the university is investigating the off-campus party, an event that sparked accusations of racism. The party included students dressed up as Middle Eastern sheiks, Buddhist monks, Viet Cong fighters in rice hats and Mexican prisoners.\nSome of the students dressed up as Viet Cong fighters wearing rice hats. (Twitter)\n\n\n\"We do have a student code of conduct which was revised last year,\" Woolf said. \"Once we've concluded our investigation, if appropriate, there are actions that can be taken under the code.\"\nQueen's code of conduct says students are \"expected to adhere to and promote the university's core values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and personal responsibility in all aspects of university life, academic and non-academic.\"\nRacists, dummies and bad costumes: Robyn  Urback ​ ​ Queen's investigates 'shockingly racist' costume party The code can apply to non-academic misconduct that occurs on or off university property. For example, a student can be considered in breach of the code if his or her conduct \"has a real and substantial connection to the legitimate interests of the university, which include, but are not limited to, its reputation or goodwill in the community.\"\nUp to the schools \n\nGreg Ko, a Toronto-based civil litigator who works on cases involving university disciplinary proceedings, said it's really up to each university to figure out how far it wants its code of conduct to apply.\n\"In this case here, Queen's could very well determine that its reputation or goodwill in the community is affected or that other students' interests are affected as well.\"\nStudents can criticize prof on Facebook, court rules \n\nUniversities have always had academic conduct standards that deal with infractions such as cheating and plagiarism. But about 25 years ago, schools started introducing non-academic standards, Boyle said.\n\n\n\"They brought in this almost moral code that you had to conduct yourself in a certain way.\"\nOther partygoers dressed as Mexican prisoners. (Twitter)\n\nBut Boyle wonders how far a university might go. For example, would a school take disciplinary action against a student for running a stop sign and crashing into a car driven by one of his professors?\n\"The principle is exactly the same when they're catching these students off campus and saying, 'We don't like the way you're conducting yourself.'\"\nFacebook case \nBoyle represented twin brothers Keith and Steven Pridgen , whom the University of Calgary found guilty of non-academic misconduct in 2007. The two had posted critical remarks in a Facebook group devoted to complaints about one of their professors.\nThe brothers argued their charter rights had been violated and that they had a right to free speech. Alberta's highest court agreed.\nBut Boyle said this decision was an anomaly. He said courts generally have agreed that universities are in a \"charter-free zone\" and don't have to adhere to its principles because they are private organizations, although publicly funded. Section 32 states the charter only applies to the government, not private institutions.\n\"So therefore, the universities are free to do whatever they want. If they want to limit freedom, they can limit freedoms,\" Boyle said.\n\nPlus, if the Queen's students are punished for their actions at the party, Boyle says they would have a tough time arguing their freedom of expression had been violated. \nQueen's students speak out about 'racist' costume party 2:44\nThe Pridgen brothers, he said, were on much stronger ground, constitutionally, because they were expressing their opinions about a professor. The Queen's partygoers were having fun, and not taking a political stance.\n\"So, the standard for giving them that freedom, wouldn't be as great,\" Boyle said.\nHe said the issue with the Queen's students really isn't about the Constitution but the jurisdictional reach of the university.\n\"This is where universities are really extending themselves.\"\nRacists, dummies and bad costumes: Robyn  Urback ​ ​ Queen's investigates 'shockingly racist' costume party But Michael McDonald, executive director of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations, said institutions shouldn't be bystanders and that they play a unique role in the education, as well as the development of many young adults.\nCodes of conduct can help facilitate these roles and generally don't amount to overreach by the universities, he said.\n\"We think that they can play important roles, especially when they're open, clear and they involve input from the rest of the community in those discussions and they are applied in a fair manner.\"",

    "text": "10 things for NASCAR fans to be thankful for By Tom Jensen Nov 23, 2016 4:22p ET 0Shares 10 things for NASCAR fans to be thakful for \nIt’s Thanksgiving time, one of our favorite holidays of the entire year. And with the 2016 NASCAR season just concluded last Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway, it’s appropriate to give thanks for a remarkable year. Here are 10 things to be thankful about in terms of the racing: Getty Images Getty Images 10 Daytona 500 \nThe Daytona 500 wound up with the closest finish since the advent of electronic timing and scoring in 1993, as Denny Hamlin edged out Martin Truex Jr. by 0.010 seconds in a thrilling battle. Getty Images Getty Images 9 Low downforce package \nFor 2016, NASCAR dramatically reduced the downforce on the Cup cars. And the aero cuts produced much better racing, especially in the first half of the year, before crew chiefs and engineers figured out how to get most of it back. The good news is there will another reduction for 2017. Getty Images Getty Images 8 Throwback weekend \nDarlington Raceway’s throwback weekend was even better the second time around than it was the first time, as teams came up with some truly amazing special paint schemes to honor the legends of the past. Getty Images Getty Images 7 Young guns \nNASCAR has never had this much young talent coming into the sport at once. Chase Elliott and Chris Buescher became the first rookies to make the Chase since Denny Hamlin in 2006, and there are a ton of great young drivers out there, including Ryan Blaney, Bubba Wallace, William Byron, Cole Custer … the list goes on and on and on. 6 XFINITY and Truck Series chases \nFor the first time, NASCAR used the Chase format in the XFINITY and Camping World Truck Series. Monterrey, Mexico, native Daniel Suarez scored a historic victory in the XFINITY Chase, becoming the first foreign-born driver to win a championship. And veteran Johnny Sauter scored a popular title in the Truck Series. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 5 Parity \nWhen all was said and done 2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jimmie Johnson won five races, most of any driver. But seven other drivers from four other teams won either three or four races, and all three manufacturers were represented in the Chase finale. That’s competitive balance. Getty Images Getty Images 4 Both Phoenix races \nThe first Phoenix race saw Kevin Harvick and Carl Edwards trade paint all the way down the front-stretch, with Harvick winning by 0.010 seconds, the same margin of victory as the Daytona 500. The second one saw a crazy finish with Matt Kenseth appearing headed for victory, only to crash out late, allowing Joey Logano to win. 3 Smoke's last ride \nWhen Tony Stewart broke his back in an off-road accident in late January, outside expectations for the season weren’t very high. But Stewart put on a dazzling drive at Sonoma, passing Denny Hamlin on the last corner of the last lap to race his way into the Chase in his final season. 2 A 7-time champ \nWe will be talking about the end of the Ford EcoBoost 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway for years to come, maybe decades. After Carl Edwards crashed trying to block Joey Logano, Jimmie Johnson made two perfect restarts to win his record-tying seventh NASCAR Premier Series championship. There is no question that Johnson is the best driver of his era and he’s making a strong case at best ever. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 1 Race fans \nA special shout out to all the NASCAR fans who come to races, watch them on television, read about them on the internet and care passionately about their favorite drivers. You are the reason those of us who work in the sport have jobs and can provide for our families. We can never thank you enough for your support, which allows us to do what we love to do. Thank you and Happy Holidays to all!",

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump walks through the lobby of the New York Times Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images Donald Trump met with the New York Times Tuesday, but not without a quick round of will-he-or-won’t-he show up. Trump, who was scheduled to meet with editors and reporters at the Times, decided at the last minute to cancel his visit, only to un-cancel it within hours. Trump’s original complaint: The New York Times had tried to change the terms of the meeting. I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 The New York Times denied this — it didn’t know the meeting was canceled until reading Trump’s tweets. Trump pressed on, however, suggesting that perhaps there would be another meeting at a later date. Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes . In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016 The mini dispute was resolved before noon. Trump showed up and started the meeting with some complaints about the Times’s reporting. Of the whole back and forth over the meeting, the Times reported , “Three people with knowledge of Mr. Trump’s initial decision to cancel the meeting said that Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, had been among those urging the president-elect to cancel it, because he would face questions he might not be prepared to answer. It was Mr. Priebus who relayed to Mr. Trump, erroneously, that The Times had changed the conditions of the meeting, believing it would result in a cancellation, these people said.” This latest Trump media tantrum is part of what has proved to be a consistently strained period between the press and the president-elect. Trump has long lambasted the Times for its coverage of him, as he did this morning — resulting in something of a subscription boom following the election . On Monday, he reportedly yelled at a group of broadcast news executives and reporters, including CNN’s Jeff Zucker, in Trump Tower. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway denied those reports . That Trump still obsesses over his representation in the media shouldn’t be surprising — during the election, he once paused an interview with the Washington Post five times to watch TV news. He has brought newspaper reporters onto the campaign stage to ridicule them. He has called journalists “lightweights” and “liars,” and prophesied the near demise of the Washington Post and the Times. The New York Times isn’t just the New York Times; it’s the “failing New York Times.” But it is becoming increasingly clear that this will continue through his presidency. The New Yorker’s David Remnick put it concisely : “The President-elect does not care who knows how unforgiving or vain or distracted he is. This is who he is, and this is who will be running the executive branch of the United States government for four years.” Trump had a weird week with the media — starting with him yelling at broadcast executives and reporters It’s been a week of meetings with the press. On Monday, it was a private, off-the-record gathering in Trump Tower; Trump invited the most high-powered network executives, reporters, and news anchors from Fox, NBC, CNN, CBS and ABC to join him in New York. Those around the table included Lester Holt, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulos, Chuck Todd, Wolf Blitzer, Gayle King, David Muir, and Martha Raddatz. But according to leaked reports, the meeting wasn’t as cordial as reporters had hoped. The New York Post reported : “It was like a f−−−ing firing squad,” one source said of the encounter. “Trump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said, ‘I hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,’ ” the source said. [...] “Trump kept saying, ‘We’re in a room of liars, the deceitful, dishonest media who got it all wrong.’ He addressed everyone in the room, calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,” the source said. “Trump didn’t say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate — which was Martha Raddatz, who was also in the room.” Trump’s “dressing down” of the media was confirmed by other outlets. According to the New Yorker’s Remnick, the participants found the meeting “outrageous”: The television people thought that they were being summoned to ask questions; Trump has not held a press conference since late July. Instead, they were subjected to a stream of insults and complaints — and not everyone absorbed it with pleasure. Conway, however, denied reports of a contentious summit. She called the meeting a success, “lively,” and “spirited” on Morning Joe . But those in attendance didn’t feel the same. Rather, the meeting seemed to be the culmination of months of resentment on the part of Trump, who has been warring with the press this entire election cycle, going back to the first primary debate when he sparked a nine-month feud with Fox’s Megyn Kelly . Trump has been fighting the press this whole election During the election, Trump claimed the press was swinging the race to Hillary Clinton. Now that he has won, he is claiming the press is misleading the public to his detriment — using unflattering pictures, and reporting with a “nasty” tone. Trump used the media to his advantage for much of the election, getting free airtime and dominating the news cycle with bombastic claims and extreme campaign rhetoric. He held press conferences often, at times even tricking the media into indirectly advertising his personal business ventures. And when in disagreement with his portrayal in the mainstream media, he usually turns to his Twitter account. “Mr. Trump has mastered Twitter in a way no candidate for president ever has, unleashing and redefining its power as a tool of political promotion, distraction, score-settling and attack — and turning a 140-character task that other candidates farm out to young staff members into a centerpiece of his campaign,” Michael Barbaro writes for the New York Times . Trump has been more reserved since mid-summer — since bringing on what proved to be his final campaign team in Breitbart CEO and campaign chair Stephen Bannon and campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. He has not held a press conference for weeks, and has on several occasions ditched his press corps. But even so, Trump hasn’t refrained from critiquing the media’s portrayal of him. Throughout the campaign, he has cut off access to journalists too critical of the Trump campaign, vowing to never speak to them again (although his desire to be in headlines usually trumps these feuds). He revoked the press credentials of the Washington Post for being “phony” and “dishonest.” He has suggested he would do the same to the New York Times . He has targeted reporters in 140 characters, over and over again. It has made journalists wary of how dedicated a Trump administration will be to transparent government. (The New York Times even asked him about his commitment to the First Amendment , and Trump said the press would be “happy” about his position.) But it also speaks volumes to Trump’s quickness to lash out against any individual or organization that speaks critically of him. Trump has been warned about his temperament — but there’s no sign he will change President Barack Obama has given Trump a not-so-subtle warning about his temperament — that it may not suit him well in the White House. “Whatever you bring to this office, this office has a habit of magnifying and pointing out, and hopefully you correct for it,” Obama said at a press conference Monday. “There are going to be certain elements to his temperament that are not going to serve him well unless he recognizes them and corrects for them.” But that doesn’t seem to be having much influence on Trump. According to Vox’s Ezra Klein, there is a good reason for that : “Trump did win, and he did it against all odds, in spite of all predictions, and by doing things everyone told him not to do. Reality has proven him, and his instincts, right.” Any prospect of Trump being shaped by an establishment administration, ready to rein him in, is dissolving with his Cabinet picks, all Trump loyalists and yes men. As Remnick writes, it was as apparent in his meeting with network executives as it was during his month-long feuds with reporters during the campaign season: The over-all impression of the meeting from the attendees I spoke with was that Trump showed no signs of having been sobered or changed by his elevation to the country’s highest office. Rather, said one, “He is the same kind of blustering, bluffing blowhard as he was during the campaign.” Trump may say he will adhere to the First Amendment, but that doesn’t change the fact that he is demonstrably thin-skinned when it comes to negative news cycles, and he has given no indication that he won’t punch back.

As a director, actor, reality show judge, mentor, designer, anchor and columnist the many aspects of entertainment keep Johar engaged. Karan, however, remains deeply rooted to the business aspect of films. In 2016 alone, Karan's Dharma Productions have produced films like Kapoor And Sons , Baar Baar Dekho and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil . He has co-produced Dear Zindagi , slated for a November 25th release, while Ok Jaanu and Badrinath Ki Dulhania are also on his list. But this story isn't about Karan the producer we look instead at Karan the distributor. After successfully distributing S S Rajamouli's magnum opus Baahubali in 2015, Karan now appears to be interested in Rajinikanth's Enthiran sequel, 2.0 . The work on 2.0 , one of the most awaited films of 2017, may be far from over but Karan's pitch to the filmmakers has already begun. When asked about the distribution rights for the film at the launch of the first look of 2.0 in Mumbai on Sunday, Karan was quick to raise his hand. \"Why do you think I am here anchoring the first look launch?,\" he quipped. \"The teaser was step 1.0 and the distribution rights is my step 2.0 for the film,\" Karan added. The Hindi version of Prabhas and Rana Daggubati's Baahubali earned Rs 120 crores at the box office, after releasing on July 10, 2015. Rajnikanth and Akshay Kumar's 2.0 has a much wider reach among the Hindi speaking audience and that is perhaps what's attracting Karan and Dharma productions to the Shankar directed film. Rajnikanth, however, is known to be loyal to his old distributors. Will he stick with Tolu Bajaj - the man who distributed Robot in 2010 - or does Karan's inclusion into the fold means new ties are being forged? We'll know soon enough. Rajinikanth and his 2.0 co-stars, Akshay Kumar and Amy Jackson, launched the first look of the sci-fi drama at a glittering event in Mumbai. Shah Rukh Khan and Kamal Haasan were reportedly invited but while they didn't attend, Salman Khan did.",

    "text": "Pistons Unveil Specifics Of Detroit Move November 22, 2016 2:44 PM Construction on Little Caesars Arena, pictured in October 2016, is moving right along. (Credit: The District Detroit) \nDETROIT (CBS Detroit) The Detroit Pistons are moving downtown to share the under-construction Little Caesars Arena with the Detroit Red Wings, and building a state-of-the-art practice facility and corporate headquarters nearby. \nChris Ilitch called the announcement a truly historic day. Detroit will become the only city in the country with four major sports teams playing in venues within a walkable distance inside the city, he added. \n“Days like today positively shape our future,” he said, adding it also shapes Detroit’s comeback story. \nA bond refinancing and other moves were announced at the Detroit Downtown Development Authority meeting that preceded the announcement. An extra $34 million is expected to be raised by the refinancing. \n“We believe now with the position the city’s in and that interest rates are in, half of the $34 million will come from savings from the refinancing” Mayor Mike Duggan reported at the meeting. \nHe added: “The city of Detroit is going to land a professional basketball franchise for a $34 million contribution, half of which is going to be savings from refinancing.” \nThe city of Detroit issued $250 million in public bonds in 2014 to help finance the arena; the Olympia organization is responsible for all the cost above the $250 million. \nFor his part, Arn Tellem, vice chairman of the Palace Sports and Entertainment said he was excited to announce the Pistons’ downtown move, and happy to say the team will contribute mightily to community programs as part of the deal. \n“We’re delighted to not just move to the city, to commit to all these community benefits, we want to be all in in Detroit,” he said. \nAbout 60 basketball courts will be repaired at a cost of $2.5 million over the next six years by the Pistons organization, Duggan reported. The city will maintain those courts. \nThe Pistons also agreed to give 20,000 tickets per year to city residents and youth as a community benefit. \nWith the Pistons and Red Wings playing under one roof just blocks from the Tigers’ Comerica Park, and Ford Field, home to the Lions, Detroit will be the only North American city to have each of the four major professional sports leagues housed within four blocks in its urban core, District Detroit said in a press release. The District Detroit includes a 50-block, mixed-use development with six theaters, five neighborhoods and three professional sports venues housing the Detroit Tigers, Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Pistons and Detroit Lions. \nThe Pistons are currently playing their 29th and final season at The Palace of Auburn Hills and will honor that history throughout the season, according to a press release. There’s no word on what will happen to the facility. \nThe Pistons’ move is subject to approval by the NBA, and is expected to be presented to the league’s Board of Governors sometime after the first of the year. Between now and then, formal legal agreements will need to be finalized, including an arena sub-concession and various other agreements between PS&E, the Ilitch organization and the DDA. \nIn the meantime, the parties have entered into various memoranda of understanding, which includes provisions for both parties’ sports franchises remaining separate and each sports franchise managing its own business operations. \nFollowing DDA approval of the agreement, the DDA board, Detroit City Council and Michigan Strategic Fund board will be asked to approve the amended tax increment plan to support the proposed refinancing. \nJohn Love of Holly, Mich., appeared at the meeting to protest the move, saying there’s no financial benefit to the city. “Violations of this whole thing are just continued non-stop,” he said. \nSteve Neavling, who runs the Motor City Muckraker website, pointed out that the press conference announcing the move was set for 3 p.m., just 30 minutes after the DDA meeting began. \nDuggan clarified that the DDA meeting was just a review, adding the approvals for this agreement must come at City Council meetings in January, February, and March 2017. \nAnother resident questioned whether billionaire team owner Tom Gores really needs $34 million from the taxpayers, and if basketball courts and clinics are the best contribution from the team. “I would encourage the Pistons to sponsor reading clinics, math clinics, science clinics,” he said. \nOfficials say the cost of building the Detroit Red Wings’ new arena, which the Pistons will now share, has jumped by $105 million to nearly $733 million. \nThe cost revision comes per the specific cost of materials, permits, design refinements and subcontractor agreements, experts said. The Detroit News says city documents indicate other construction costs could rise. \nOfficials say the revision doesn’t indicate massive cost overruns nor that taxpayers will face additional expenses. \nIlitch said the “stunning” arena is on target for its opening date next fall. \nWhat’s to happen with the Palace? District Detroit said in the release that Gores believes it’s “premature to discuss the future of the Palace, but expects there will be a lot of attractive options.”",

    "text": "Senior investigative reporter for ThinkProgress Contact me: jisrael@thinkprogress.org 10 hrs ago Why has the NRA been cozying up to Russia? The Right to Bear Arms in Moscow enjoys a close relationship with America’s leading gun-rights group. Photo Illustration by Adam Peck. CREDIT: AP Images/Maria Butina Throughout the 2016 presidential campaign, there was a steady stream of stories published about Donald Trump, his second campaign manager , his supporters at Wikileaks , and the ties they appeared to have to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian Federation. Reporting also highlighted that, more than any other national organization, the National Rifle Association (NRA) went all-in to elect Trump . But no attention was given to the ties between the NRA, a Russian gun-rights group run by a twenty-something gun activist named Maria Butina, and her close friend and boss, the deputy governor of the Russian central bank, Alexander Torshin. Why does an American gun group that promotes gun rights as a defense against tyranny align itself with a group with close ties to an authoritarian regime? Why would Putin allies build a grassroots non-profit to loosen Russia’s gun laws, rather than just enact them? Experts who spoke to ThinkProgress say they are not sure, but they discussed whether the whole arrangement is a cover for a larger effort to undermine American sanctions against Russia. A meeting in Moscow On December 11, 2015, in the depths of a biting Moscow winter, The Right to Bear Arms hosted a delegation from its American counterpart, the NRA. David Keene, an NRA board member and former national president of the organization, flew to Russia to attend the event. Also at that meeting were NRA First Vice President Pete Brownell , CEO of the world’s largest firearm accessories supplier; NRA funder Dr. Arnold Goldschlager and his daughter , NRA Women’s Leadership Forum executive committee member Hilary Goldschalger; and Outdoor Life channel head Jim Liberatore. Perhaps the most famous guest at the gathering, trading his customary uniform for a black leather vest over a button-down shirt, was Milwaukee County Sheriff and Fox News regular David A. Clarke. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke at the National Rifle Association’s 2014 convention CREDIT: AP Photo/AJ Mast Clarke said little publicly about the event. Two weeks earlier, his office put out a vague press release noting that he would “travel to the Middle East and Asia beginning November 28, 2015 and returning December 13, 2015,” including that he’d “receive briefings on issues facing those regions and visit historic sites.” But the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Daniel Bice noticed that Clarke’s January 2016 ethics disclosure filing shed some light on the trip. Part one was $20,155 trip to Israel, paid for by the NRA Ring of Freedom. During his week-plus of travel there, he did a remote interview from Jerusalem for Fox Business Network. The remaining days were spent in Russia. His airfare to Moscow and visas, totaling $13,785.10, were paid for by Brownell; his $6000 worth of meals, hotel, transportation, and excursions were provided by the “All-Russia Public Organization ‘The Right to Bear Arms.’” Clarke’s office declined to release any records to Bice about the trip, the reporter wrote, “saying it was personal — not official — travel, even though personal trips (a.k.a. vacations) are not supposed to be listed on the ethics form.” At that conference, according to a post on the Right to Bear Arms’ Facebook page, in addition to group’s chairman and founder Maria Butina, a welcoming speech was delivered by honorary member of The Right to Bear Arms Alexander Torshin. CREDIT: The Right to Bear Arms Facebook page The Godfather and the Godmother? Maria Butina grew up in Altai, a mountainous area in southern Siberia, but moved to Moscow when she was 22. Almost overnight, she gaining notice as the founder and chair of Russia’s gun-rights movement. Reportedly a strong supporter of Putin and his United Russia Party, she helped start The Right to Bear Arms about five years ago as a non-profit organization. The group, she vowed, would not be a front for “ any bloody lobby ” and would be funded through dues from members. “I personally have a furniture and household appliances business,” she told Russian newspaper Izvestia. “People who give us money for work, they are usual gun owners because to have a gun in Russia is very expensive. So these people, they have money and they give us money,” Butina explained in a 2014 interview with Townhall’s Katie Pavlich. “We have no money from government, not one coin from government.” The group now claims 10,000 members . Though Russia’s constitution does not contain Second Amendment-like gun rights, her rhetoric is remarkably similar to the NRA’s. “More legal guns equal less crime,” she told the Moscow Times this year, “If a country bans guns, only criminals have access to them.” After the Sandy Hook mass shooting in 2012, her group criticized gun-free school zones as ineffective prohibitionist policies. “In this shooting six teachers died, six people who could literally use only their hands to defend children… The murderer planned this knowing that no one would be armed,” she told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. “What is the right to life, ingrained in our constitution, if you don’t have the right to bear arms? If a person wishes to defend himself, he has no means for protection.” Like the NRA , Butina tends to dismiss the connection between guns and death, including suicides. “People online take facts from my blog, turn them upside and scream ‘Just look at this! In the States, 30,000 people die from firearms every year! How awful!’ But so what?” she told the New Republic in 2012. “Switzerland has the most suicides using a gun, and yet, Switzerland has the least number of total suicides. Moreover, a gun is the most humane weapon for suicide compared to all the other methods that exist.” The same article noted that, early on, Butina “gained a powerful ally”— Alexander Torshin , who is an NRA Life Member , a “high-ranking member” of Putin’s United Russia and, at the time, the first deputy speaker of the Russian senate. The NRA took note when Torshin authored an unsuccessful bill that year that would have allowed public use of firearms. When he presented the bill to his colleagues, days after the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting that left a dozen dead, his colleagues were not sold. They feared Russians, too, would all shoot each other. “How can you have so little trust for yourself, for your people,” he asked them. In 2014, however, Putin’s government did change the law to allow licensed gun owners to carry weapons in public for self-defense. After years serving in the upper house of parliament, in 2015 he was appointed deputy governor for Russia’s central bank. Butina was appointed “special assistant” to Torshin at the bank. Their close relationship is evident in their work and social media presence. In 2014, she praised him as a “great gun lover” who supports both The Right to Bear Arms group and the NRA. Last month, Torshin tweeted a photo of her holding a baby, calling her “the godmother” of the child. Torshin also has been called “ the godfather .” While he’s only admitted to having been a godfather in the religious sense, Spanish investigators claimed in an August report that the “Russian politician Alexander Porfirievich Torshin stands above [an alleged figure in the Moscow-based Taganskaya crime syndicate], who calls him ‘godfather’ or ‘boss’” and conducted on his behalf “activities and investments.” Torshin denied the allegation, telling Bloomberg “I’m a public individual and I’m not hiding anywhere.” Torshin told the New Republic’s Julia Ioffe in 2012 that he admires the NRA because it represents “‘stability’ — the credo of Putin’s reign.” The Keene connection In May of 2013, Torshin traveled to the NRA convention in Houston. Months later, he wrote about it in an Washington Times OP/ED about the passing of Mikhail Kalashnikov (the inventor of the AK-47). “Last year, I had the pleasure of attending the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting in Houston,” he recounted. “Kalashnikov couldn’t join me, though we have both been ‘life members’ of the NRA for years. At 93, his health was even then beginning to fail, but I thought of him as I toured the exhibit area where I saw dozens of AK-47 clones.” The opinion editor for the paper is the NRA’s David Keene. In between, Keene traveled to Russia for a fall 2013 gun conference , hosted by The Right to Bear Arms. Butina’s online advertisements for the event specifically highlighted his participation, calling him “the former president of the legendary NRA.” She chaired the event, Torshin attended , and Keene spoke. Keene posted a picture of his visit with Torshin on his personal website and shared it on Facebook . Weeks after the conference, Butina explained in a LiveJournal post that just because a foreign citizen is an NRA member, that does not necessarily mean they are a spy. In April of 2014, Butina traveled to the NRA’s annual meeting in Indianapolis. She was given the “ rare privilege ” of ringing the organization’s replica of the Liberty Bell and presented a plaque to NRA President Jim Porter. She attended a women’s luncheon as the guest of former NRA President Sandy Froman and participated in the general meeting as Keene’s special guest. Butina blogged about her trip , noting that she was invited to speak at the exclusive Ring of Freedom dinner with “the patrons who donated” more than $1 million to the NRA. Before leaving the country, she stopped by the organization’s national headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, and posed for a picture with Keene. Butina returned the following April for the annual convention in Nashville. She marveled about winning a necklace and earrings at the silent auction, attending the women-only NRA women’s forum, and about the lack of democracy in decision-making. “In spite of all democracy, foreigners, even if the members of the NRA, can not vote for the adoption of decisions,” she observed, noting that at The Right to Bear Arms, “we maintain direct democratic elections. In my opinion, as the founder of the organization, it is more fair to the citizens.” Torshin attended the May 2016 convention in Louisville, Kentucky, meeting with Trump and even sharing a table with Donald Trump Jr. at one of the dinners. The Right to Bear Arms has a ways to go before they can develop the outsized level of influence its American counterpart enjoys. But in 2014, it successfully convinced the Russian parliament to pass a castle doctrine bill. Butina has talked a great deal about bringing the NRA’s successful programs, like the group’s Eddie Eagle curriculum for kids, to Russia. A hidden purpose? Butina’s interests appear to go beyond just guns. She frequently writes about her opposition to economic sanctions by the west, including those on Russian arms . In a 2015 article for The National Interest, she wrote , “It may take the election of a Republican to the White House in 2016 to improve relations between the Russian Federation and the United States.” Not long after Butina’s 2014 visit, the NRA put out a little-noticed statement criticizing the Obama administration’s sanctions against Russia. Noting that the crackdown included Russia’s arms manufacturer, they wrote: “While the United States government blames the Ukrainian conflict for this latest move, gun control advocates will no doubt applaud the ban on importation of some of the very types of firearms at the center of recent domestic attempts to ban so-called ‘assault weapons.’” Weeks later, The Right to Bear Arms announced it would soon host another NRA representative in Moscow, “ life member ” Paul Erickson, for an “ open meeting .” In 2015, Butina traveled around country following Republican presidential candidates. She attended Gov. Scott Walker’s (R-WI) announcement speech in Waukesha, Wisconsin. As an audience member a Trump campaign event in Las Vegas, she asked the candidate about sanctions and his commitment to lift them if elected. Josh Horwitz, executive director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, told ThinkProgress that U.S.-Russian economic ties, rather than gun rights, could be the real aim of The Right to Bear Arms. “I think the important thing is all those involved with this are close with Putin. If Putin wanted more guns in Russia, he doesn’t need to develop an NRA in Russia to push him,” he observed. “What are the NRA officials doing cavorting around with people close to Putin? The NRA says they’re the nation’s oldest civil rights group. I could see them being in line with dissidents in Russia, who are out of power, discriminated against, and subjugated by the Russian government,” he continued. “But the idea that the NRA is running around with someone who is basically a dictator — the question is why. The people he’s running around with are all about removing sanctions on drilling and other things. I think this is more about getting out to the American Right the views about lifting the sanctions than anything about gun rights.” Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, added that the sanctions could be of key interest to the NRA’s financial backers as well. “The NRA is a gun industry trade association masquerading as a shooting sports foundation,” he observed. “The organization has received tens of millions of dollars in gun industry financial support from around the globe and has partnered with gunmakers on a wide range of marketing efforts. The NRA’s reasoning in working to establish a Russian beachhead could range from working to end Obama Administration sanctions that ban the import of Russian-made AK-47s and assault shotguns to hoping for new financial donors as the result of a loosening of the country’s gun laws.” Butina told ThinkProgress in an email that there are no financial connections between the American and Russian groups. “The Right to Bear Arms and your American NRA are completely separate organizations. We have no political or financial ties of any kind,” she wrote, adding that they are “literally ‘comrades in arms’ in a shared belief that a right to own a firearm makes people safer.” “I’m sorry to disappoint you,” she wrote, “but there is no international conspiracy at work surrounding the organization I founded, ‘The Right to Bear Arms.’” She added that her group’s payments for Sheriff Clarke’s visit and others in the NRA delegation were “something any decent host would do when friends visit,” but did not respond to questions about whether other American politicians had also been brought to Moscow at the group’s expense. The National Rifle Association and Torshin did not respond to ThinkProgress inquiries about their relationship. Now with Trump and Putin agreeing to normalize relations in the coming year, expect the already close relations between Trump’s friends at the NRA and Putin’s friends at The Right to Bear Arms to be closer still. Perhaps it will become evident just what these two groups are really up to.",

    "text": "Tweet \nOne Santa working at a Florida mall was quickly put on the naughty list when he began telling children that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is also getting a lump of coal this year. \nWhile playing the role of Santa Claus at the Seminole Towne Center in Sanford, Florida, last week, the jolly man in red got one parent hot under the collar by telling two kids an ill-advised joke about the former secretary of state, WKMG-TV reported . \n“She tells Santa what she wants, and then he tells her she’s on the nice list. He then says that there’s only one name on the naughty list. ‘Can you guess who?’ My daughter says, ‘Who?’ And he says, ‘Hillary Clinton,’ and then started laughing,” the mother recounted in a Facebook post, according to the news outlet. \nThe parent complained to mall management and within a short time her post went viral on social media. That naughty Santa was quickly reassigned to another mall and will be required to undergo sensitivity training. \n“Santa was given additional training to ensure that he remains in the character of Santa during all future appearances,” a Seminole Town Center statement read. “Santa is a symbol of peace, joy and goodwill for all and we are pleased that we are able to bring this cherished symbol to the communities we serve.” \nThe Noerr Programs, the company in charge of the Santa Claus displays, also released a statement on the ordeal saying that, while the St. Nick actor is still employed with them, he has been sent to a different location. \nSpokesman Charlie Russell said Noerr has apologized to the child’s parents.",

    "text": "Co-Founder of Scripted.com, CEO The Bold Italic, Columnist @Inc. 15 hrs ago “Bedtime” by Puja Saraiya Abid You haven’t posted all day. Your Facebook timeline doesn’t look quite right. What will your friends think? You have an audience to keep happy for your second job. You are your own social media manager. You are your own branding consultant. Your personal brand matters to the world because you are important. People care what you think and need to hear from you. Time to get to work. What should you share today? Today could be the day you change the world with a Facebook post. You browse your News Feed for inspiration. So many good posts today — every good post you read gives you anxiety. How can I top what my friends say? You need to win. You are better than them. Facebook has become the de facto place to share your political views. Those get a lot of likes but run a high-risk profile. Should you share a politically charged article with a clever caption? Everyone has the same views as you, so your posts won’t matter anyway. Oh wait — except for that one alt-right friend of yours. And the alt-left fruititarian friend who called for a ban on Whole Foods products because they broke a seal’s nail during a cargo transfer in Alaska. You later discovered that that news story was fake. Your friends commented on your alt-left-friend's post, but he still insists it’s true. After all, it was trending. What about a sunset? Or a picture of your last meal? The one you cooked at home. You are such a talented chef. You know how to perfectly cook meat (caption: “perfectly cooked rack of lamb — took only 12 hours!”). Everyone will be so impressed. No — not deep enough — you need to demonstrate more depth of character. Maybe you can change the world with a brilliant insight about labor economics. That Daily Mail article illustrates your point perfectly. But wait. Daily Mail . You can’t share anything from Daily Mail  — it’s not authoritative enough for you. You have editorial standards. What will your friends think if you don’t share from the New York Times , the Atlantic or the New Yorker ? It won’t meet their standards. It won’t meet your standards. You’ll be secretly judged. You can’t have that. Move on. The News Feed flashes before your eyes. It’s moving too fast. You are running out of time. You need to post soon. Maybe you could share something personal? Maybe you could share a picture of your family. But last time that was a disaster. Your family didn’t get as many likes as your friend’s family. You posted to Facebook and Twitter via Instagram — maybe that was the reason. Maybe you should have used the Amaro filter instead of the Valencia filter on Instagram. Your family is cute. There is no way in a totally controlled environment your friends’ family could have possibly gotten more likes than your family. They won this round—54–41 — but you’ll get the next one. Next time you’ll stage the picture properly. Every time a family member posts a picture of you, you untag yourself. You are too cool for that shit. Gotta keep up appearances. You don’t need that polluting your timeline. “Race Day” by Puja Saraiya Abid . What about changing your profile picture? That would be a major shake-up. You’d get a ton of likes. Maybe you could use that selfie from a jungle in Guatemala. Or that picture of you looking contemplative on a beach. Or the other one of you jumping, where the camera caught you midair in a smile. Maybe the one where you are at the finish line of a marathon. What about the one where you’re nursing a baby alpaca back to health? You look so caring in that picture. So nurturing. So happy. Everyone will love it. You will be showered with adoration. On second thought, maybe that’s too big of a change for today. You browse Facebook for inspiration. You see a status update from John. Years ago, the two of you got into a fight. Is it time to reconcile? Is it time to extend an olive branch? You like his status. Maybe he will reach out. Maybe this is an indication that the two of you are “cool” now. You are filled with hope, and you are wondering what he is thinking. Maybe he will feel the same. You also like your ex’s status. Maybe she will notice, you think wistfully. Who is that woman with Ken? Didn’t he just get divorced? You secretly judge. You “love” his picture. You have to make sure he doesn’t know how you really feel. What is that random political rant Talia just posted? You think about a comment you could post in response. But you refrain. No politics, sex or religion in your News Feed or comments. You want to make sure the social-justice warriors don’t skewer you. That would be bad. You have to abide by their rules to live a happy social media life. Don’t deviate too much from their thoughts, and you’ll be fine. You switch to your mobile phone because you are tired and need to lie down. You are exhausted. You take an Ambien. You are lucid only for another 15 minutes, so you’d better post quickly. What is Facebook’s algorithm displaying on your phone as compared to your desktop? Is it different? What does this teach you about their algorithm? Let’s see. You scan your phone. You look at the top of the News Feed — it’s Annu. Why the fuck does Annu’s grandma like every one of his statuses and post some weird religious comment on each one? That’s weird as all hell. And he posts a picture of his baby literally every day with some emotional comment. They all look staged. How on earth does he have time for that? You don’t have time for that. You’ve just spent two hours on social media. Oh God. There’s Sean posting again about his company. They raised another $5M dollars. He’s “humbled and grateful.” What a crock — he is the least “humble” humble person you know. And his profile picture — so appalling — that black-and-white picture of him speaking at a conference looking contemplative and waving his hands in the air makes you cringe. You hope his company fails — you hate watching him succeed. You like his status. You comment, “Congrats!” Exclamation points are important. They show real enthusiasm and emotion. What does his company even do? You scroll down farther. There’s more to learn. There go Martina and Yusuf posting another vacation selfie again. They are always kissing each other in photos. Why on earth can’t they spare you just once from the intimacies of their life? They must be fucking other people. They must be masking the relative mediocrity in other areas of their lives by posting selfies. It looks like they make 15 attempts at each picture before posting. It’s not possible to perfectly purse your lips like that every single time. You are such a good person. You are not like them. More scrolling. More liking. You can’t stop liking Facebook status updates. You are so generous. You feel like Santa Claus. You are probably making some of your friends’ days — especially the ones who posted updates that previously had no likes. What a terrible day for inspiration, though. You look back on your own photos to see what might be useful. You smile at your mobile photos of your trip to Austin. There are the pictures from your college graduation. You look back at your wedding album. Those were good times. There are the pictures of you at the hospital with your firstborn. You took all the right pictures, but were you really ever there? You search Twitter — you see what’s trending. Maybe if you post about a trending topic, it will get more traction. You check what’s trending on Facebook too. You go on Instagram and try out a few hashtags. You want to see what’s being searched for to maximize success. Stirring the pot by posing an open-ended question is never a terrible strategy — maybe you can try that? You are data driven. You are a genius at this social stuff. No one can do this better than you. No one can duplicate the method you’ve put together. A clever “someecard”. You look at a few celebrity accounts. What is Gary Vaynerchuk posting about? What is Tim Ferriss posting about? What about George Takei — he’s so clever. You aim to be like him. Maybe you should just share one of his posts? Maybe you should post a someecard? Those usually do well. But no. You want to be original. Maybe you can take something he posted about and paraphrase it a bit. No one will notice. Eureka! You have it. You have the status update you’ve been waiting for. It took a long time, but you finally got there. It meets your editorial standards and the editorial standards of your own personal echo chamber. You post it. You feel satisfied. You feel relieved. This one is going to do well. Two minutes pass — your first like — Kristin. She doesn’t count. She likes all your status updates. She couldn’t possibly have read the article attached to it. She liked it within five seconds. Does she have a crush on you? Coincidentally, she can’t seem to figure out how to stop sending you Candy Crush notifications. Someone should let her know — just not you, and not today. More likes. More validation. You feel good — you feel high. This one is going to do well — it’s on the right trajectory. Mission accomplished. Nice work. Your job is almost done. Now you just have to worry about Snapchat, Instagram, LinkedIn, Medium and Twitter. The world is waiting to hear from you. How many shares will this receive?",

There was no apparent link among the killing of Detective Benjamin Marconi and three other shootings in which officers were wounded, and officials cautioned that many questions about the shootings remain unanswered. But they added to the sense of a profession under siege, coming after a series of killings in which officers were singled out. “I feel we were targeted,” said the San Antonio police chief, William McManus. “I think the uniform was the target, and the first person who happened along was the target.” In July, a gunman killed five police officers and wounded nine other people in Dallas, and days later, another gunman killed three officers and wounded three others in Baton Rouge, La. Both gunmen were killed by the police, but they first made clear that they were angry about police killings of black men. This month, in the Des Moines area, two officers were gunned down in their patrol cars, and the police arrested a man who had been described as having a hatred of law enforcement . Sunday’s shootings prompted strong reactions on social media, including some posts calling the episodes part of a war on law enforcement, or blaming people who have criticized the police over a string of highly publicized deaths at the hands of officers. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Violence against the police dropped to 31 officers fatally shot (aside from accidents) in the line of duty in 2013, from a high of 144 in 1973, according to records kept by Officer Down Memorial Page , a nonprofit group that tracks such episodes. Last year, there were 39. But so far in 2016, there have been 58 killings — a pace that would make this the worst year since 2011. “People are reacting to this phenomenon of police being specifically targeted, which we saw some of in the ’70s, but we haven’t seen it recently,” said Geoffrey P. Alpert, a professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Carolina. “It’s hard to do community policing when you don’t know if somebody’s going to take you out.” In San Antonio, officers were advised to ride two to a car, rather than patrolling alone, until the killer of Detective Marconi, who was 50, is caught. The officer had stopped a driver near Police Headquarters and was sitting in his car writing a ticket when a person unconnected to the traffic stop walked up and shot him at close range. The Police Department later showed reporters surveillance video of an unidentified person, taken a few hours earlier, at the front entrance of the police building. The video shows a young man pacing and speaking into an intercom. The doors open and he enters, then he leaves seconds later.

    "text": "The Best Way to Treat Your Period Cramps Watch Iskra Lawrence Strip Down On the NYC Subway While Making a Plea For Body Positivity \n\"Every single one of us has so much value and so much worth that is more than just skin.\" By Diana Bruk Nov 22, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below New Yorkers have seen a lot of things on the subway (clowns selling wholesale bras, Lion King musical extra eating McDonalds, rats valiantly carrying a slice of pizza three times their size, just to name a few of my personal favorites), but it's likely they've never seen Aerie supermodel Iskra Lawrence take off her clothes while making a heartfelt speech about her long journey towards loving her body. Although to be honest, most of them were probably too caught up with their books, podcasts, or Candy Crush to notice. \"I grew up hating what I saw in the mirror because society told me I was not good enough,\" Iskra says in the video. \"I thought there was something wrong because I didn't have a thigh gap, that I had cellulite, that I wasn't skinny enough. That is the media; that is society making a small standard of beauty when we are so much more than that.\" A video posted by Iskra lawrence🦄✨ (@iskra) on Nov 19, 2016 at 6:30am PST \"This body is not just something to be objectified, to be grabbed, to be looked at. This is my vessel, this is my home,\" she continued. \"I respect it....Every single one of us has so much value and so much worth that is more than just skin. We are all brothers and sisters, we are all equal. This is just our vessel.\" Iskra has become one of the leading supermodel spokespeople for body positivity, often speaking about her tumultuous relationship with her measurements, and the importance of loving yourself . And that's great and all, but most New Yorkers still just want their commute to be as quick and painless and free of viral stunts (however well-intentioned) as possible, right?! ",

For the football and everything else. I can see myself conquering the US as I have with Europe. \n\"Lots of people stay in one place throughout their career, but I've travelled around like Napoleon, and conquered every new country where I've set foot. So perhaps I should do what Napoleon didn't and cross the Atlantic and conquer the States as well.\" \nWe all know that Zlatan has never had problems in believing in himself - but when did he conquer Europe? He hasn't even won the Champions League! \nIs his comments a big hint that he could be moving to MLS sooner rather than later?

    "text": "Gathering Field frontman Bill Deasy brings new album to Nick's Fat City reunion   Singer-songwriter Bill Deasy. By Scott Mervis / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nPeople who have hung around the Pittsburgh scene for a decade or two, or three, are aware of how club names can be used as an adjective or shorthand, as in “Decade bands,”“Banana bands,”“Graffiti bands.” \nIn the next era, with a little overlap, came the “Nick’s bands,” those that played weekly gigs at Nick’s Fat City on the South Side from the early ’90s till it became Diesel in 2004. NICK’S FAT CITY CHARITY JAM \nWhere: Stage AE, North Shore. \nWhen: Doors at 6 p.m. Saturday. \nTickets: $25 advance; $28 door; www.ticketmaster.com. \nBill Deasy, frontman of the Gathering Field, can almost get a little teary-eyed thinking about singing his anthemic “Lost in America” to packed crowds there that sang along with every word. \n“I look back on that era a little like I didn’t know what I had when I had it,” he says. “It was just such a beautiful time. All that original music. People were just packing into clubs all over town to hear original music, and that was unusual. In hindsight I see what a gift that was. The camaraderie and the selfless energy that was there, everyone singing on each other’s record and opening for each other and touring together, there was a sense that if one of us made it, all of us could.” \nSix of the biggest bands from that scene — The Clarks, the Gathering Field and Brownie Mary (all of which signed to national labels) and Buzz Poets, Vibro Kings and Grapevine — are assembling Saturday for the Nick’s Fat City Charity Jam being held at Stage AE, North Shore. \nFans will be able to add some new Bill Deasy music to their collection, but it’s not under the banner of The Gathering Field, which split in 2002 and reformed in late 2013 and released “Wild Journey” a year later. \nOver the past two years, he was writing new songs for a Gathering Field follow-up, but, he says, the band’s guitarist and producer, Dave Brown, was tied up with his day job. So, he turned to Jake Hanner, the prolific producer and drummer for Donora, for what’s become his eighth solo album, “Timeless Things.” \n“I laid down 10 songs I had acoustically and I had an instant rapport with Jake,” he says. “He was recording my voice in a way I hadn’t heard before.” \nNormally, he would replace those scratch vocals for later takes, but they chose to keep them, and then paint around them with fine session work from guitarists Rob James (The Clarks) and Noah Minarik (son of Clarks guitarist Noah Milnarik), bassist Anton DeFade (son of Gathering Field drummer Ray DeFade) and drummer Hanner. Among those adding vocals are Clarks singer Scott Blasey, GF guitarist Clark Slater and national recording artist Maia Sharp. \n“It was all feeling so fresh and good and effortless in a way,”Mr. Deasy says. \nThe result is a warmer-than-usual lush quality to “Timeless Things,” yet another set of richly poetic folk-rock songs from a singer-songwriter who pens verses like this: “I’m as holy as an angel/​I’m dirty as the earth/​sniffing for salvation with everything I’m worth/​but every new temptation’s still like a song that I ain’t quite rehearsed.” \nHe laughs during the interview when told he’s not writing like a dad who has spent lots of time the past decade hanging out at little league fields. \n“I have a little bit of a default setting,” he explains, “like a go-to character, kind of like the guy from ‘Lost in America’ in all the different phases of his life. So, I’m still probably with him, who is me, but I hide behind those stories. \n“That character is definitely in this record, but I think on this album some of the songs, like ‘Crapshoot’ and ‘Then December,’ are on the sad, struggling end of the spectrum, and some, like ‘After All’ and ‘You Alone,’ there’s an emerging feeling of kind of coming out the other side of the tunnel. There’s drama to that whole journey, and I’ve committed to that journey, through the darkness and occasionally into the light.” \nThe most painstaking entry, he says, was the quiet, slide guitar-driven closing track —“End of the Record Song.” \n“I was in a Jackson Browne kind of moment,” he says, “and I just wanted to write a song that authentically reminded me of his best stuff from the ’70s. I was really going for that and worked on that over and over for a two- or three-day period just trying to get a lyric that worked for me. I always care about the songwriting. I just think I took it to an extra level this time.” \n“Timeless Things” will be available at the merch table Saturday night, but the songs likely won’t make it into the Gathering Field set. \n“The Gathering Field has been so nice to me in that way,” he says. “We’ve done some recent gigs where we’ve played these songs, but the Nick’s show will be purely older stuff, all from the ’90s probably, just because it’s a celebration of an era.” \nScott Mervis: smervis@post-gazette.com; 412-263-2576.

    "text": "'We are the unlucky team' 1:30 A statue of Zlatan Ibrahimovic to be erected in Stockholm after he won his 11th Golden Ball award 7 hours ago by Staff Writers with AAP Source: FOX SPORTS IT’S been a big week for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nHe may have been on the sidelines for Manchester United’s draw with Arsenal but that hasn’t stopped the star striker from making the headlines. \nHere are the latest developments in the world of Zlatan. \nIBRAHIMOVIC TO BE IMMORTALISED IN STATUE — AAP \nA STATUE of Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be erected outside the Friends Arena in Stockholm, with the star striker winning the Golden Ball award for the country’s best male player for the 10th year in a row. \nThe 36-year-old Manchester United forward, who retired from international football after Euro 2016, played 114 games and scored 62 goals for Sweden, including a spectacular four-goal salvo against England in the first game at the arena in 2012. Zlatan Ibrahimovic. (AP Photo / Fredrik Sandberg, SCANPIX) Source: AP \nIbra has now won the Golden Ball a record 11 times — since its inception in 1946 no other player has won the award more than twice — and his contribution to the game will be honoured with a 2.7 metre statue outside the Friends stadium. \n“It feels unreal. Many are thinking ‘Why him?’ and so on but after all the hard work over 15 years in the national team and 20 years in my club career, it feels like it’s being appreciated,” Ibrahimovic said as he accepted his award on Monday. \n“You usually get this after you die but I still feel alive. \n“When I die, this (statue) will live on forever.” \nThe Diamond Ball for the best female player went to 33-year-old Chelsea goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, who won the award for the second year running thanks to her key role in Sweden’s silver medal-winning team at the Rio Olympics. \nBECKHAM LEADS THE PLAUDITS FOR ZLATAN \nIBRAHIMOVIC’S former Paris Saint-Germain teammate David Beckham delivered a video tribute to the striker on the evening. \nIn a pre-recorded video message, reported by TV4Sport, Beckham said Ibrahimovic was “one of the greatest players” in world football. Beckham and Ibrahimovic at PSG. (Photo by John Berry/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images \n“His physique, his passion, his love for the game, hasn’t changed,” Beckham said. \n“He’s still one of the greatest players that has ever played the game — one of the reasons why I’m happy he is now playing at Manchester United, my team. Thanks for that, Zlatan.” \nBeckham said Ibrahimovic’s immense desire to win set him apart from his contemporaries. \n“For me, Zlatan is a player who has class, always wants to win, and he proved that when I moved to PSG,” he said. \n“He was one of those players that it doesn’t matter whether we were playing an important match in the French league, or on the training field, he wanted to win. \n“If he wasn’t winning, he was like one of my children. He would get upset, he would get angry, he would lose it. Not that my kids lose it, but Zlatan does. \n“For me he is a winner.” \nZLATAN EYES OFF NEXT MOVE \nHE MAY only be months into his time at Manchester United but that hasn’t stopped Zlatan Ibrahimovic from speculating on his next move. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates scoring. / AFP PHOTO / Oli SCARFF Source: AFP \nAnd it’s one that could take him beyond Europe’s shores. \nIn an interview with Aftonbladet , the Swedish star said he could see himself “conquering” the MLS in the future. \n“It’s a huge option for me, for the football and everything else,” Ibrahimovic said. \n“I can see myself conquering the US as I have with Europe. \n“Lots of people stay in one place throughout their career, but I’ve travelled around like Napoleon, and conquered every new country where I’ve sat foot. \n“So perhaps I should do what Napoleon didn’t and cross the Atlantic and conquer the States as well.” \nSpots in the American league are opening up again, with the likes of Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Robbie Keane all set to move on from the MLS this season.

    "text": "Agency Report Related News \nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said on Friday that it had received requests from 60 associations for registration as political parties. \nNick Dazang, the Deputy Director, Voter Education and Publicity, INEC, told the News Agency of Nigeria that as soon as the commission was through with the processes, it would meet and take a decision. \nNigeria currently has about 29 registered political parties. \nMeanwhile, some of the deregistered political parties have criticised INEC for re-registering some of the parties it deregistered in 2012 instead of all the parties. \nIn separate interviews with NAN, the parties said it was wrong for INEC to still allow parties it deregistered to remain, while planning to register new associations. \nThe National Chairman of the Progressives Action Council (PAC), Charles Nwodo, said the party would head to court again on the matter. \n“We went to court at a particular time and along the way, the Judge ruled that we come with a group of political parties. \n“He said if we had come as a single party, he would not have granted us, and eventually granted only the parties we joined to head to court. \n“But some other parties still went to court and among all the rulings both at the High Court and Appeal Court was that INEC has no legitimate powers to deregister political parties. \n“What INEC wish is that if they make any pronouncement, you have to head to court to make them reverse it. That is the situation we find ourselves. \n“I believe that if an Appeal Court had ruled on a case, automatically, it has opened doors for mass reregistration of political parties; when a court says you have no right, it means you have no right at all. \n“So the alternative for us is to head to court again,’’ Mr. Nwodo said. \nThe National Chairman of African Renaissance Party (ARP), Yahaya Ndu, said his party was not ready to go to court for now. \n“INEC re-registered only political parties which went to court to contest their deregistration. \n“We have not gone to court and we are not in a hurry to do so now. 2019 is coming, we will be back before then. \n“However, all the ones that have been re-registered what impact are they making? When we come back Nigerians will know that this is the party that will bring succour to them,’’ Mr. Ndu said. \nBala Shittu, INEC’s Director for election and party monitoring, told NAN that INEC had re-registered 10 out of the 28 political parties it deregistered in 2012. \nA Lagos Court of Appeal and Federal High Court, Abuja had in 2015 ruled that INEC lacked power to de-register political parties. \nMr. Shittu said the 10 re-registered political parties were joined in the court proceedings. \n“As you know, it is part of the court judgment that ordered INEC to reinstate them, so they were part and parcel of the proceedings and so they were joined. \n“The other remaining deregistered political parties were not part of the process. \n“There were actually two judgments, one by three and the other by seven; so they were two separate proceedings,” Mr. Shittu said. \nHe said the parties planning to take INEC to court, perhaps were doing so for different reason. \nHe said there was a time frame as stipulated by law within which a political party could take the commission to court concerning de-registration, adding that the period had lapsed. \n“You may recall that these court proceedings were not entered last year or even year before last, so the court process has been on but finally it brought this judgments,’’ Mr. Shittu said (NAN).",

I don't know what has happened,\" Ibrahimovic told British media. \n\"I didn't even ask him because it's not important for me and I'm 100 per cent sure the media doesn't know what really happened. I think we should appreciate him for the player he is, what he did. \n\"I don't see many players from England who have had the same career as him. I feel a little bit sorry of the situation because we should show more respect for him.\" \nRooney put in an inspired performance in Thursday's 4-0 Europa League victory over Feyenoord, scoring United's first-half opener from an Ibrahimovic through ball to become the club's all-time leading scorer in Europe with 39. \nThe goal also put him just one behind Bobby Charlton's overall club record of 249. \n\"As a person he's fantastic, I have the luck to get to know the person. As a player, there are no words to not say about him -- he's the perfect player,\" Ibrahimovic added. \n\"Everybody knows what he can do, what he did, what he has done.

    "text": "Note ban: How Narendra Modi changed narrative from black money to cashless economy \nNov 28, 2016 11:32 IST By Dinesh Unnikrishnan \nThe primary pitch and narrative of the demonetisation drive by Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to have taken a major shift to cashless economy from the initial key highlights of war against black money, corruption and counterfeit currency. That’s the inference one can draw from the PM’s Mann Ki Baat speech on Sunday. \n“Our dream is that there should be a cashless society. This is correct that 100 percent cashless society is never possible. But we can make a start with less-cash society, then cashless society will not be a far-off destination,” Modi said in the programme. Prime Minister Narendra Modi. PTI \nA significant part of the radio programme was devoted to the youth with the PM calling out to make the transition happen first to a ‘less-cash economy’ and a ‘cashless’ economy later. There was mention about black money, but the core of the talk was change to a cashless economy. \nThe PM urged people to start using cash substitutes like debit cards and digital wallets, saying it will make transactions cheaper and easier and in the long-term it will help India \"leapfrog into a less cash-use economy at par with more developed nations.\" \n\"We are also urging banks to make a big push with PoS (Point of Sale) machines with traders so that debit card use becomes more prevalent,\" Modi said. \nInterestingly, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor, Urjit Patel too shared his mann ki baat on the same day, after a stoic silence on the note ban and three weeks after the announcement. \nIn an interview to PTI, Patel urged people to start using cash substitutes like debit cards and digital wallets. The central bank governor said it will make transactions cheaper and easier and in the long term. It will help India \"leapfrog into a less cash-use economy at par with more developed nations.\" \n\"We are also urging banks to make a big push with PoS (Point of Sale) machines with traders so that debit card use becomes more prevalent,\" the RBI governor said. The RBI is monitoring the situation on a daily basis, he said, urging people to start using cash substitutes such as debit cards and digital wallets, which will make transactions cheaper and easier, Patel said. \nClearly, the common factor in both Modi’s and Patel’s talk is migration towards a cashless society, especially targeted to the youth, rather than black money. Migration to a cashless society is obviously a good thing given that electronic banking transactions would be easier and more transparent than handing over cash. It can cut down the time taken per transaction and wouldn’t require people to carry cash to wherever they go. But, as PM Modi mentioned in his programme, a good number of people are still hesitant to use their mobile or internet banking, E-wallets and Unified Payment Interface (UPI) for banking transactions. The idea of transformation to a cashless economy, though will take time in a country 70 percent of which still lives in cash economy, is welcome but one cannot deny that there has been a clear change in the demonetisation narrative by the Modi-government and in its pitch. \nTo understand this, take a closer look at the first press release of demonetisation announcement by the government and PM’s speech on 8 November where he announced the decision to ban Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes from the banking system. \n“With a view to curb financing of terrorism through the proceeds of Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) and use of such funds for subversive activities such as espionage, smuggling of arms, drugs and other contraband into India, and for eliminating Black Money which casts a long shadow of parallel economy on our real economy, it has been decided to cancel the legal tender character of the High Denomination bank notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denominations issued by RBI till now. This will take effect from the expiry of the 8th November, 2016,” the government release said. \nThe release spoke extensively on the black money issue, cited a 2010 World Bank study to say that the estimated size of the shadow economy for India grew from 20.7 percent of the GDP in 1999 to 23.2 percent in 2007 and listed the steps taken by the Narendra Modi -government in last two years to curb black money. There was no mention about change to a cashless society. \nIn PM Modi’s speech too, there was no major references on shift to cashless economy, with the major focus of the demonetisation being projected as war on black money, terror funding and corruption. “To break the grip of corruption and black money, we have decided that the 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee currency notes presently in use will no longer be legal tender from midnight tonight, that is 8 November 2016… This step will strengthen the hands of the common man in the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency.” \nWhen will the cash crunch end? \nOn the other hand, despite three weeks after the note ban, the cash crunch continues across the country, especially in non-metros, where people are still struggling to find lower denomination notes. ATMs and bank branches are still running dry. This is despite the assurances by the government and the RBI that there is enough cash in the system to cater to all customers and the government mints are working in full capacity. But, it is doubtful that whether the assurances are reflecting on the ground. Instead of assuring again, a presser by the RBI governor Urjit Patel addressing the public to detail the cash situation in the banking system would have been far more effective. \nAs Firstpost has noted before, there is also a price the economy will have to pay as the cash drought is likely to have hit economic activities badly. A clear picture would emerge only after a few months though. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the actual effect of the currency ban on black money, corruption and counterfeit notes will be much given that the measure alone doesn’t address the problem and would need steps beyond demonetisation. PM Modi has assured follow up steps. One needs to wait and watch. But, at this stage, there is a clear, notable shift in the demonetisation pitch. \n  11:32 IST Related News",

Before long, the pair are getting on like a house on fire and even share a kiss – but how long before the truth comes out about Finn’s repeated visits to hospital and the pretence he made to nurses that he was Kasim’s boyfriend and might these actions put Kasim off pursuing anything further? \nAt the start of the week, Finn is disheartened when he seeks Kasim out and finds out that he has been discharged from hospital. He is left glum when he fears that he has lost him for good but soon Kasim turns up and they finally meet, with Finn practically star struck that the man he has been visiting is even better than the fantasy he had been creating for himself. (Picture: ITV) \nPete warns Finn that he needs to be honest with Kasim from the outset as secrets always have a habit of coming out. Agreeing to tell Kasim about his regular visits, Finn attends lunch with him but is stopped in his tracks when Kasim spontaneously kisses him. (Picture: ITV) \nWith his dream of finding love with Kasim becoming a reality, Finn decides against telling the truth but when Emma later meets with Kasim, Finn’s heart plummets and he fears she will reveal everything to him.

    "text": "It Ain’t Over Yet—Giving Thanks for Foster Campbell, the Last Shot to Get One More Democrat Into the Senate November 25, 2016 8:00 am Expand Photo: Getty Images \nTwo weeks after Election Day, a new Democratic Party hero is emerging on the Internet: Foster Campbell, a 69-year-old cattle farmer, public service commissioner, and—no pressure—the Democrats’ last hope to flip a Senate seat in their favor. In a runoff election set for December 10, Campbell is challenging Republican John Kennedy for Louisiana’s Senate seat; if Campbell wins, he’d push the ratio of Senate Republicans to Democrats from 51–48 to 51–49, no small feat in what could be a long four years under the Trump administration. \nCampbell, a Newt Gingrich doppelgänger, is an unlikely online celebrity—he isn’t hip like President Obama, or meme-able like Joe Biden—but he is nevertheless inspiring a groundswell of support from Democrats around the country who want to help him win that precious extra seat. Campbell is like a beacon of hope, giving disconsolate Democrats someone, and something, to root for—one last chance to check President-elect Trump’s power in a Republican-controlled government. Non-Louisiana residents are taking to Twitter to plead for donations to Campbell’s campaign ; sign-up sheets for the candidate’s phone bank are circulating on Facebook , and Rachel Maddow and CNN have interviewed Campbell about his platform. A former seven-term state senator, Campbell described himself in a recent news conference as “on the right side, helping the people”: He has fought to lower energy rates for rural farmers, passed measures to waive utility deposits for victims of domestic violence, and is pushing for equal pay. \nSo, what sort of shot does Campbell have? Democrats have a terrible track record when it comes to turning out for elections on the state level, and Kennedy earned more votes in the first round of the runoff in the Republican-dominated, red state of Louisiana—25 percent of the vote to Campbell’s 17.5 percent. But that was before Campbell’s race became one of national interest. With a new wave of energy and resources, and the support of Louisiana’s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, Campbell is vowing to “fight like hell and be outspoken.” That’s something to be thankful for.",

(File photo) - + The Council of University Presidents of Thailand (CUPT) has requested an English version of the national tests which students sit to apply for universities to offer more chances for English Programme (EP) students to enter tertiary education. \nThe call comes after CUPT received complaints from schools with EPs that their students who study in the special programmes are unable to fully understand some of the questions in the standardised exams as they are only written in Thai. The Thai tests are the Ordinary National Education Test (Onet), the national nine core subject examinations, the General Aptitude Test (Gat) and the Professional Aptitude Test (Pat). \nCUPT secretary Prasert Kanthamanon said EPs have been launched in many public and private schools in the past six years in response to the Education Ministry's Asian Economic Community preparation project. The standardised tests for entering tertiary education should be available in both Thai and English languages, he said. \n\"Students studying in EPs have to study almost every subject in English and some subjects with foreign teachers. They learn almost everything in English. However, when they have to take the national exams for which scores will be used to apply for universities, they have to do it only in Thai, so they may not understand every question clearly,\" said Mr Prasert. \nAs a result, he suggested that Niets create an English-language version of all standardised tests to help EP students improve their chances to enrol in universities. \n\"All questions and content for English-language versions of exams should be exactly the same as the Thai-language version, but only translated into English. Moreover, students should be able to choose which versions they wish to take,\" he said. \nMr Prasert said CUPT has proposed this idea to the ministry through its permanent secretary Chaipreuk Sereerak, who agreed with CUPT. \"We said the English-language version of all standardised tests should be available by the next academic year. However, we still have to talk in detail with Niets first,\" he said. TAGS",

    "text": "The writer is Executive Director News, Express News, and Editor of The Express Tribune. He tweets @fahdhusain [email protected] \nDear General Qamar Javed Bajwa: \nCongratulations on being appointed the new Chief of the Army Staff. Welcome to the hot seat. Here’s what you might want to consider as you adorn the four stars– and a heavy responsibility – on your shoulders: \n1) You will retire in November 2019. This means you will oversee the final stages of crushing terrorism from Pakistan (we hope); the free and fair elections of 2018 with a peaceful transition of power (we hope) and a Trump-Modi double whammy that may be coming to a theatre near you (we hope not). That’s quite a load of work piled up on your desk. You may want to have a cracking team on your side and we earnestly hope you choose wisely from the best on offer. \n2) The first order of work will be to assure the nation the momentum of Operation Zarb-e-Azb will not be slowed but in fact will be accelerated. In the very initial days of your appointment you will need to say or do something that categorically establishes your intentions in this respect. Do keep in mind you have very large shoes to fill. Fill them you must. Pakistan cannot afford you not doing so. \n3) Your predecessor clarified a key confusion that was clouding the mind of the nation thanks to most political leaders: the so-called ‘misplaced brethren’ were less brethren and in fact more butchers of our fellow citizens. Your predecessor, after having called them for what they were, proceeded to do what needed to be done. And that too with the requisite ruthless efficiency. But there is still some confusion left about the ‘Non-State Actors’ (NSAs) who it is said mean us no harm, but whose association with us is now making us a pariah in capitals that matter. You were a young officer when this policy was crafted. We have paid an unimaginably high price for it. You will need to bury this policy as an acknowledgement that this is your era, not that of the generals of yore. Your decision can chart the right future for your children and our children. The moment is upon you. Seize it. \n4) You will have to deal with the Modi menace. India’s next general elections are due in 2019, the year that you retire. However the campaign for the elections will obviously start much earlier. Modi was currently campaigning for the state elections in Punjab and he has already threatened to stop our waters. He will get worse with time. We will go into election mode next year even though they are not due till 2018 and policy will automatically take a back seat. Not that it has a front seat even now since your predecessor and his predecessor and his one too all gripped the India policy steering wheel firmly. Modi will test you. Modi will push you. Modi will mock you. You should respond in two ways: first, I’m tempted to say turn the other cheek, but don’t. How you nuance this may be themost difficult and important decision that you may need to make. That’s why you have four stars on your shoulders. Second, bring in the civilians. Make them own the India policy. Don’t mock the Pakistani leader; mock the Indian one. And do it with the civilian leadership. \n5) Please keep in mind we have a solid case on Kashmir. Modi’s pellet gun policy is making it even more solid for us. And yet the world is not acknowledging our argument. It is no secret that we are spoiling our own case by: a) refusing to realize the yawning gap between what we say and what the world believes we do, b) failing miserably to engage world opinion through imaginative, innovative and aggressive diplomacy by able, articulate and eloquent women and men who can represent us on the global stage. Your time in office is coinciding with a wave of right wing nationalism and xenophobia in important regions of the world. While Trump and Modi glower at us and Ashraf Ghani is impatient to do mischief, you may see Marine Le Pen winning the Presidential election in France, unleashing a “Frexit” thereby killing the European Union for all practical purposes. It may be a long shot for Le Pen, but so was it for Trump. The world is changing. We must adjust accordingly. As must our policy on Kashmir. \n6) At home you may want to internalise some home truths: you are not the ‘Umpire’ and you should not be in the business of raising your finger. Actually wait, you can be the umpire (as your predecessors have in the past), but you should not. We hope there is no need for you to play this role. But we also realise that your institution cannot just disengage from non-military affairs of the state and retreat into your own shell. This may happen in the future when the civilian institutions are well-developed and systems are working in consonance with the aspirations of the people of Pakistan. For the next three years, that is a tall order. So while you cannot disengage, you can engage with wisdom and foresight borne of a conviction that national interest demands so. Yes sire, the definition of national interests does change with times, and the one that coincide with your time should include the following: In addition to securing our borders and wiping terrorists and extremists off our land (and de-clawing their apologists), national interest demands you help strengthen all institutions civil and military so that Pakistan can have a safe, prosperous and educated future. You have a key role in firmly establishing this new national interest. Help those who may have lesser institutional capacity to do so. \n7) Do not allow your institution to fiddle in the next general elections but do keep a close eye to ensure no one else does either. We are hoping the political leadership will succeed in instituting electoral reforms so that the next elections are the fairest yet. Help them do so if possible. \n8) Clean up Karachi. The rot is still there. \n9) Your predecessor set an example by holding people from your institution accountable for their misdeeds, and doing so publicly. Such transparency boosted the stature of the armed forces. Do continue this policy to set an example for all institutions. \n10) In November 2019, leave the army and the country a better place than where it is today. That would be a legacy any man would be proud of. \nWishing you the best, General Bajwa.",

Charlotte Owen at her House of Che Che boutique in Failsworth (Photo: Sean Hansford) \nWhile Failsworth is not perhaps known for high fashion, Charlotte believes the location on Ashton Road East will make her company stand out for all the right reasons. \nCharlotte says: “I had initially looked in Cheshire and South Manchester, but it’s already quite saturated in those areas, so when I found this location I thought I can bring something quirky and different that’s still close to town, and right next to the M60 so easy for people to get to, but without the ridiculously high rent and rates. \n“If you have the right product, people come to you.” Read More James Milner joined by Liverpool team and showbiz stars at annual charity extravaganza House of Che Che boutique in Failsworth (Photo: Sean Hansford) \nFashion stylist Charlotte cherry picks fashions from a range of quirky brands, ranging in price from £29 jumpers to £60 Freddy jeans through to £300 hand-printed dresses by cult label Rixo. \nThere are also sparkling accessories including statement necklaces, hand-stitched make-up bags and jewelled handbags, as well as cute pom pom shoes.

Charlotte Owen and dad Gary Owen at House of Che Che (Photo: Sean Hansford) \nGary says: “I’ve instilled in Charlotte that it’s all about value - keeping costs down so that you make it that when anybody walks through that door they know they are getting value for money, whether that be a £30 or £300 item. \n“I encouraged her to come back from London and set up her own fashion business because she really knows her stuff.

    "text": "Ron Elkman | Sports Imagery | Getty Images Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick #14 of the New York Jets is hit by Isa Abdul-Quddus #24 of the Miami Dolphins during a NFL game at Hard Rock Stadium on November 6, 2016 in Miami Gardens, Florida. For the typical American going to work every day, the demands of your job probably don't include your daily dose of pain medications which are administered by your employer. Imagine being an employee at General Motors or Chase Bank and being forced to see your \"company doctor\" for all ailments and being prescribed addictive pain medications. Now what if that same job resulted in daily injuries, most of which would be considered debilitating for the general population? \nWell this was the reality for me and countless other NFL players. \nAfter my third football-related knee surgery, doctors diagnosed me with arthritis at 24 years old. I went on to have a total of nine surgeries as a result of football injuries and my current ailments include nerve damage, a needed knee replacement and a host of other physical diagnoses that I won't mention. \nOh yeah, if you saw me today, I'm a 37-year-old who feels great most of the time and I definitely appear to be in impeccable shape. I'll be the first to say that pro athletes don't need any sympathy, as we choose to play the sports we love and so we should bear the consequences that come along with it. \nBut the sad reality is, when you're a young aspiring athlete and your team doctor tells you that something will help you recover, most 22-year-olds don't break out the medical journals to understand the side effects. Actually, most people in general trust their medical professionals, especially when they are as elite as NFL medical staff, who usually carry the highest accolades in their field. \n\n\"If you ask me, pushing addictive pain meds on young pro athletes should be criminal.\" The reality is that I worked with countless medical staff members who provided toxic pain-management drugs for me to control my injuries and quickly reduce my swelling in an effort to minimize recovery time. I even witnessed coaches publicly embarrass people in front of the team if you didn't get a shot or pop pills in order to play on Sunday, and even practice. \nI took Vioxx (a pain killer that was later banned and removed from distribution over safety concerns) sometimes daily for years as prescribed by my team doctors and trainers as an anti-inflammatory pain reliever. When Vioxx was banned, we were prescribed Indocin and other pain medications and were given Toradol shots. (Both Indocin and Toradol remain on the market but with warnings about serious side effects including the risk of heart attack or stroke.)\nI didn't realize until after my retirement that Vioxx had been banned and that Merck agreed to a $4.85 billion settlement over the drug. This Merck settlement realization caused me to review lawsuits and reports on the side effects of drugs like Vioxx, Indocin and Toradol, which I used before, during and after games as well as for general injury maintenance in order to practice. Unfortunately my revelations were too little, too late when I already had years of daily prescription use under my belt during my five-year NFL career. Fast forward, I'm nine years out of the league and I'm starting to pay the price. After finding a tumor in my thyroid and battling through a few other health concerns, I can't help but think back to at all those toxic meds and shots that I took for years. \nIt makes me wonder if I knew then what I know now: What would I have done if I had to choose between keeping my job and taking dangerous prescription drugs? That's the one question that haunts me.\nWhen I see a normal, non-sports team-affiliated doctor these days, he/she always clearly explain the side effects or at least give me options to understand what medicines I'm putting into my body. \n\nSo I've grown to learn and appreciate how the medical world operates outside of the NFL. Keep in mind that, in the NFL, we didn't pick up a prescription from the local CVS, or have a doctor consultation to discuss side effects. We were asked if we could take the pain of a needle, we pulled down one side of our pants, took the shot of Toradol in the butt and hustled out to the field following the national anthem. \nAs strange as it sounds, most NFL players have never see a non-team-affiliated doctor until years after they are retired, which could be well into their 30s, just as I did. I mean, why would I? We had the best doctors in the world looking after us, right? \n\nThe hard truth about cannabis vs. painkillers Jonathan Wiggs | The Boston Globe | Getty Images A man displays medical marijuana he picked up from a Massachusetts first medical marijuana dispensary in Salem. If I had used marijuana, which shows promise in treating arthritis and bears minimal chance of organ damage, medicinally, the NFL would have fined me and I could have faced prosecution — a risk that an estimated 50 percent of NFL players run each season. (Marijuana is now legal in more than half of states for medicinal purposes but still banned under the NFL's collective bargaining agreement with the players association.)\nNot only are opioids addictive, they can kill you. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2014, more than 14,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids. \nThe facts relating to cannabinoids as an alternate are pretty clear: \"You can't directly die from taking a cannabinoid, the way tens of thousands of people are directly dying from opioids each year in the U.S.,\" says Dr. Daniel Clauw, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of Michigan. \nIf you ask me, pushing addictive pain meds on young pro athletes should be criminal. \nIf you follow the NFL or you're into fantasy football, you've probably noticing a number of big named and role players getting suspended for four games and even entire seasons for \"illegal substances.\" Just this year, the league has fined over 20 players a combined $10 million-plus for violating the league's substance-abuse policy. A majority of these cases involve marijuana, which seems hypocritical given the teams themselves are prescribing the players much more harmful and addictive medications than the ones that they are actually resulting in the fines. \nThere is no wonder why thousands of former players have joined together to pursue major class action lawsuits against the NFL. This has resulted in Drug Enforcement Agency and Justice Department investigations on how prescription drugs are distributed in NFL facilities. Prior to the start of this football season, Federal Judge William Haskell Alsup denied a motion by the NFL to dismiss the players' lawsuit, which will allow the discovery phase of this trial to begin. When you consider the potential magnitude of this lawsuit, and the current billion-dollar-plus concussion settlement that the league faces, there's no wonder why the typically politically correct owners are considering backtracking their harsh stance on cannabis. \nWith so many states now legalizing some form of legal marijuana use, the NFL and its conservative owners must face the inevitable. The players' association is beginning to push the league to reevaluate their logic. \n\"Certainly given some of the medical research out there, marijuana is going to be one of the substances we talk a look at,\" says Players' Union Executive George Atallah. \nThe league's response to the topic included a statement that it would be open to reconsidering its policy, but the league's medical experts haven't recommended any changes. Let's remember that these same medical experts denied that football caused concussions. \nThe perception of the league's treatment of players' health can't get any worst following the blockbuster hit movie \"Concussion,\" starring Will Smith. So yes, a grown man can be paid to run full speed into other grown men every day and he has one choice: toxic pain killers and anti-inflammatory meds that have been proven to do massive damage to your liver and other organs. If you choose a natural route like marijuana, you are subject to millions in fines and will likely be suspended or terminated. Seems like a pretty bad deal to me. \nThis article is in no way a advocating for the misuse or abuse of marijuana as a recreational drug, but an attempt to voice the concerns of some of the great men who have lost their lives and left their families without loving fathers following horrible health issues — everything from head trauma to widespread painkiller abuse. \nI'll be the first to admit that marijuana also comes with its own health concerns, which can include breathing problems, increased heart rates and some reports of links to schizophrenia. But when put side by side with harsh painkillers and toxic anti-inflammatory medications, there is no comparison. \nEven beyond sports medicine, users report that marijuana has a host of health-related advantages. It has been known to help with pain, multiple sclerosis and Tourette's syndrome. \nSuper Bowl-winning Seattle Seahawks' Coach Pete Carroll and numerous other key NFL names openly suggested the NFL should consider medicinal marijuana as a legitimate treatment for the injuries its players sustain. \nIt's well past time for the NFL to get with the program and consider marijuana as an option for the treatment of pain. \n\nCommentary by Jack Brewer, a former NFL safety who played for the Vikings, Giants, Eagles and Cardinals.

    "text": "NEW DELHI: With an eye on the Poorvanchali and Bihari migrant voters in Delhi, BJP Chief Amit Shah appointed Bhojpuri singer-actor and North-East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari , a relative newcomer, as the new state unit chief on Wednesday. \n\nIn Bihar , Nityanand Rai has replaced Mangal Pandey as the new state BJP chief. Announcement of new party chiefs for these two states, where BJP had faced electoral drubbing under Shah’s presidentship, was pending for the last 10 months. \n\nThough Tiwari was being touted as a front-runner for the post for the past few months, his announcement came as a surprise to some who felt he has been chosen over ‘dyed in the wool’ party leaders. \n\nTiwari was earlier with SP and had unsuccessfully contested against Yogi Adityanath from Gorakhpur in the 2009 polls. He had joined BJP close to the 2014 polls. \n\nNityanand Rai’s appointment as Bihar unit chief is also a bolt from the blue for many in BJP. A first-time MP from Ujarpur, Rai belongs to the Yadav community that has unflinchingly supported Lalu Prasad-led RJD. Shah apparently chose Rai as he does not belong to any camp in the deeply divided Bihar BJP and would hence rise above factional politics.

    "text": "Big Mac inventor Jim Delligatti dies aged 98 Updated December 01, 2016 12:30:36 Map: United States \nThe man with one big claim to fame — inventing the McDonald's Big Mac — has died at the age of 98. \nJim Delligatti's start with McDonald's was unremarkable, becoming a franchisee of a McDonald's in the Pittsburgh region in the 1950s, but in 1967 he had his big breakthrough and made the first Big Mac. \nHe began serving the creation — made up of two beef patties, lettuce, cheese, onions, special sauce and pickles on a sesame seed bun — at his Uniontown restaurant for 45 cents and it quickly expanded to his other 47 stores. \nIt was added to the McDonald's US menu in 1968, and came to Australian shores in 1971 when the first store opened in the Sydney suburb of Yagoona. \nAccording to his son, Delligatti consumed at least one Big Mac per week for decades. \nThe Big Mac has been used as a reference point by the Economist for 30 years to compare the cost of living in different countries — a concept called the Big Mac Index. \nIn 1992 Pittsburgh was even temporarily renamed Big Mac, USA in honour of the burger's 25th Anniversary. \nFor the 40th Anniversary, Delligatti opened the Big Mac Museum in Pennsylvania which has the world's largest Big Mac statue. \nMore than 900 million Big Macs are sold annually around the world yet McDonald's says Delligatti received no payment or royalties for the creation. \nEarlier this year the biographical film The Founder was released which portrays the story of Ray Kroc, who turned McDonald's into a billion-dollar fast food empire. \nDeligatti is survived by his wife, two sons, five grandchildren and eight great grandchildren.

After most of the first half with foul trouble, HPU leading scorer Andre Fox rattled off six straight points for the Purple & White to start the comeback. Down by 13 with 90 second to play, the Panthers limited Morgan State to only three free throws the rest of the way while putting up 17. High Point scored eight of its final 17 from the free-throw line, going 8-9 down the stretch. Wright had seven of the Panthers' final 17 points while Lindauer had five. \n\"Our kids are just a resilient group,\" head coach Scott Cherry said. \"When I said they were resilient, I didn't know they had that in them.

Freshman Jamal Wright ended the run and sent the team into the locker room on a high note with a contested jumper with one second left for the Panthers who went into the half down 31-20. \nHPU shot just 26.1 percent (6-23) in the first 20 minutes, including an 0-8 mark from behind the arc. The team turned the ball over 13 times and had 16 personal fouls prior to halftime. Advertisement ",

    "text": "HOW DARE HE?! Because Rep. Tim Ryan working to replace ancient Pelosi is SEXIST (or something) Posted at 10:04 am on November 21, 2016 by Sam J. \nHey guys, anyone who wants to replace Nancy Pelosi is a sexist. Just an FYI. \nIan says so. This thing where an obscure male backbencher thinks he deserves to replace the most accomplished woman in Congress is how sexism works. https://t.co/mHaNuQcRib \n— Ian Millhiser (@imillhiser) November 20, 2016 \nAn obscure MALE backbencher, gosh Ian, that’s harsh. What, you’re not going to point out he’s an evil white guy too? \nTim Ryan has been in office for 13 years, he’s younger, he’s less establishment, uses far less Botox and has fresher ideas for a party that is dying. Did you see what happened to the Democrats this year? Painful. It’s clear Democrats are tired of cranky old ladies who think they know what’s best for the party when they don’t. \nBut sure, it’s sexism for anyone to want to challenge Pelosi. \nHa! I agree. The Democrats should keep Pelosi until she dies and however she performs. Otherwise they’re sexists. https://t.co/VYFEh8Zvrs \n— Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) November 21, 2016 \nRepublicans of course love this idea because Pelosi (and other Democratic dinosaurs) is killing the party. With her in any semblance of authority the Democrats have had years and years of legislative losses. Trending And CURTAIN! S.E. Cupp takes defensive 'Hamilton' cast member to task over Pence; 'It's just rude' \nThanks y’all, keep it up. Well, this Republican strongly thinks that she should keep Nancy Pelosi on board. Yeah, cause sexism or something. @imillhiser @thehill \n— Kurt Schlichter (@KurtSchlichter) November 21, 2016 \nYES. BECAUSE SEXISM! @imillhiser As a Michigan Republican, I can honestly say @TimRyan 's message was pretty good. Ohio supports him too. #WhereYaBeen , Ian? \n— Sandy (@RightGlockMom) November 20, 2016 \nShhhh woman. Don’t you know speaking out against Pelosi is sexist?! Even if you’re a woman … oh wait, is that how this sexism thing works? It’s all so confusing. How dare anyone born after the New Deal have any say in how the Democratic Party is run… @imillhiser",

    "text": "twitter Hotel Jesus. supplied \nJust as Sydney was getting good at that small bar thang, Melbourne raised the stakes to remind their northern sibling who’s king of not just the drinks, but the food to accompany them. Three of our 10 best this year come from the tradition, from Town Mouse spin off Embla to Bar Liberty under a bunch of former Attica alumni. \nWe also got out of town because Igni, Aaron Turner’s homecoming post Loam, is too good to ignore – if you’re there, also seek out his other casual venture, Hot Chicken Project – while Captain Moonlight in Anglesea under Matt Germanchis will be the place this summer. \nThen there was the welcome return of what’s now known as the Stokehouse Precinct in St Kilda, where the casual beachside diner Pontoon has just opened as part of the reborn Van Haandel flagship. And the precious Charlie Carrington, 22, wise beyond his years in a 7-year career that included Vue de monde and Sydney’s (now gone) Marque, laid it on the line with Atlas Dining in South Yarra while another former Vdm chef, Clinton McIver, continued the degustation drive with a Amaru in Armadale’s High Street. \nHere are the 10 best restaurants we found in Melbourne and surrounds in 2016. Igni \nOK, so we’re classifying Geelong as an outer Melbourne suburb, but it’s only 60 minutes away, and anyone who remembers Loam, which closed in 2013, will feel their heart beat faster to know Aaron Turner is back in town with the culinary equivalent of a large hadron collider. The meal is $100 or $150 a head, depending on whether you choose 5 or 8 courses and you have no idea what's to come upon entering monastic warehouse dining space with its wood-fired grill, seafood focus and native flavours. It might include raw calamari with saltbush berries, char-grilled squab and King Edward potatoes with society garlic. Surrender to his restrained pleasure. \nIgni 2 Ryan Place, Geelong. Tel: 03 5222 2266 Lunch Sat-Sun, dinner Thu-Sat Embla \nTown Mouse duo Dave Verheul and Christian McCabe headed into the CBD to open this all-day, no bookings (natural) wine bar and bistro, where the half roast chook on a menu of straightfoward, comforting food designed to play handbag to the wines is reason alone to venture in. You could snack on anchovy toasts forever, find a delicate drop to keep the smoked ocean trout rillettes with fermented tomato and rose company, or tackle something more substantial from wood-fired oven and grill as McCabe reveals an amazing world of flavours in each glass he pours. \nEmbla 122 Russell Street, Melbourne. Tel: 03 9654 5923 Lunch Mon-Fri, dinner Mon-Sat Marion Supplied \nNever mind Andrew McConnell turning Moon under Water into a Chinese gaff, his wine bar beside Cutler & Co was the Melbourne maestro's best move this year. The weekend breakfast is a welcome list of hangover cures, from merguez sausage, shakshouka and shanklish to garfish on toast, and a mortadella sandwich with gentleman’s relish. Blame a 20-page wine list that kicks off around the $50 mark, gives Australians plenty of love, but isn't shy about offering DRC La Tache for $3000+ to wash down prawn rolls, venison tartare, whole flounder or corned duck and pork jowl on a simple menu that lets you snack or bag of 250g porterhouse before cheese. \nMarion 53 Gertrude Street, Fitzroy. Tel: 03 9419 6262. Breakfast Sat-Sun; Lunch Fri-Sun; dinner nightly French Saloon \nThis light-drenched, scrubbed-back frolic, with its 6-metre-long zinc bar, above Kirks Wine Bar, is the brainchild of the European trio Ian Curley, Con Christopoulos and Josh Brisbane. The bistro menu is tres 4th arrondissement with contemporary cheekiness, from house-made charcuterie to wagyu tartare with truffle and chips, boudin noir with celeriac remoulade, smoked tongue with soured cream and three cuts of steak before cheeses and gelato and creme caramel. You don't have to think too hard to have a great time, which you suspect is precisely the point. \nFrench Saloon 1st Floor, 380 Little Bourke St (via Hardware Lane), Melbourne.

One of Australia's best sommeliers teamed up with a couple more of his former Attica mates and Rockwell & Sons chef Casey Wall to deliver a smart and sassy wine bar where the foods is quixotic and intriguing as what's in the bottles. Behold mussel dip, salt & pepper vegies, cured scallops with fermented buttermilk, XO pippies with savoury donuts. Try the $45 eight-dish shared Sunday lunch, but you may want to keep a 1994 Crawford River riesling all for yourself. \nBar Liberty Lunch Sun; dinner Wed-Sat Higher Ground \nBaby Boomer demographers rejoice - the avocado on sourdough with citrus salt and finger lime is only $13.50 here, so there's enough cash left over to negatively gear this impressive, three level soaring former powerhouse site that's now a smartly on-trend cafe. Alongside the quinoa and seed bircher we'd gladly skip, there are daylight dishes such as steamed fish with Japanese broth and vegetable noodles, and a lamb sausage roll with cucumber pickle and anchovy mayo. Come evening, there's serious effort in masterstock-braised pork shoulder, and garfish in paperbark with guanciale and tamarind dressing. This fresh lively cafe from the team behind Top Paddock and Kettle Black is just the shot. \nHigher Ground 650 Little Bourke St, Melbourne. Tel: 03 8899 6219 Breakfast & lunch daily; dinner Thu-Sat Oter \nMelbourne's answer to Parisian bistronomy comes courtesy of French-born Florent Gerardin, who trained under Ducasse and Robuchon, then locally walked the high-end wire with Shannon Bennett and Mark Best's Pei Modern. His Asian-influenced French dishes tiptoe between poetry in prose, from sardine on toast with prawn paste to tete de veau (veal head terrine), spanner crab with kombu, rabbit with artichokes and dijon, and duck with a cocoa crust. Or you put your trust in his hands with 3- or 5-course (menu du jour). The dessert tarts are a highlight. Oter Basement, 137 Flinders Lane, Melbourne. Lunch Monday–Fri; dinner Mon–Sat Captain Moonlite Matt Germanchis. Photo: Gemma Gange. \nThis is the place Victorian summers were made for. Pei Modern's Matt Germanchis and his work/life partner Gemma Gange have gone coastal at Anglesea Surf Life Saving Club, with their European bistro and bar the Great Ocean Road. There's a simple, perfectly pitched brekkie - baked bean & cheese toastie? Oh very yes! - then homemade prawn crackers, fried calamari, snapper with raisins and lemongrass, slow-roasted lamb to share, and donuts with chocolate salted caramel for later on as you gaze out at the beach. \nCaptain Moonlite 100 Great Ocean Rd, Anglesea. Tel 03 5263 2454 Breakfast & lunch Fri-Mon; dinner Thurs-Sun Hotel Jesus Source: supplied \nTake a 125-year-old former post office, add Matt Lane of Mamasita fame, designer James Brown from Adelaide's Africola, and a design aesthetic that sits somewhere between Happy Days and Speedy Gonzales cartoon for what the Jesus (as in hay-suss) team call a “Mexican tostaderia meets tile-laden Americana diner”, and you have fast and furious no-bookings Mexican cantina. A laminated picture menu complements the tick-a-box ordering of everything from tostados (crisp, dried tortillas) topped with tuna and ponzu, or the “porktopus” of octopus and pork crackling, to tacos and ceviche and barbecued corn with black mayo. Wash it down with cerveza michelada – beer with lime and spices, or tequila cocktails on tap and it’s ¡Andale! ¡Andale! ¡Arriba! \nHotel Jesus Open Wed-Thu 5pm-late; Fri-Sun 11.30am-late IDES \nThe influence of his Kiwi colleague is apparent in former Attica sous-chef Peter Gunn's style, but it's clear he studied the master well and is now developing his own bold voice at this contemporary fine diner where chefs deliver the food to your table. The seven dish $110 menu might pair oysters with a sweet and sour saffron syrup and smoked herring roe; and braised pork neck with broad beans, grilled cabbage and chorizo sauce; and chocolate. For even more fun, there's a midweek 4-course $60 experimental menu - expect pickled ham hock stuffed in a tomato and basil cream. That Gunn's earlier pop up is now a permanent fixture is a major fillip to Collingwood's culinary renaissance. \nIDES 92 Smith St, Collingwood.

    "text": "Donald Trump appoints first woman Nikki Haley in his cabinet, as envoy to UN Donald Trump appoints first woman Nikki Haley in his cabinet, as envoy to UN The 44-year-old daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley represents what some Republicans hope could be the new face of their party: a younger, more diverse generation of leaders. By: Reuters | West Palm Beach | Washington | Updated: November 24, 2016 7:34 am South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. (File) \nDonald Trump on Wednesday named South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a former critic with little foreign policy experience, to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations at a time of uncertainty over America’s international role under his presidency. Haley, one of two women chosen so far for a job in Trump’s Cabinet, is “a proven dealmaker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage,” the Republican president-elect said in a statement. \nThe 44-year-old daughter of Indian immigrants, Haley represents what some Republicans hope could be the new face of their party: a younger, more diverse generation of leaders. \nHaley took Trump strongly to task during the presidential campaign over his harsh rhetoric about illegal immigration and for not speaking forcefully enough against white supremacists. \nTrump has chosen mostly male conservatives so far for senior positions as he shapes his administration following his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 election. Trump takes over from Democratic President Barack Obama on Jan. 20. \nAlso on Wednesday, a spokesman for former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said Trump had not offered the retired neurosurgeon the post of housing and urban development secretary, disputing a Wall Street Journal report, which the newspaper later corrected. \n“Trump did not make an offer,” Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams told Reuters. “He asked him to consider HUD. Nothing has been offered and no decision has made.” \nThe Journal, citing two people familiar with the deliberations, also reported that Trump was expected to pick billionaire investor Wilbur Ross as commerce secretary. \nIn a video message released ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Trump said he hoped the holiday would be an occasion for Americans “to begin to heal our divisions” following a “long and bruising political campaign.” \n“Emotions are raw and tensions just don’t heal overnight,” Trump said. “Now begins a great national campaign to rebuild our country and to restore the full promise of America for all of our people.” \nAMERICA’S GLOBAL ROLE \nThe choice of Haley may be aimed at countering criticism of Trump’s divisive comments about immigrants and minorities, as well as accusations of sexism during his election campaign. \nHaley led a successful effort last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston. The flag was carried by pro-slavery Confederate forces during the Civil War and is viewed by many as a racist emblem. \nHaley said she had accepted Trump’s offer and would remain governor pending her confirmation to the Cabinet-level post by the US Senate. \n“When the president believes you have a major contribution to make to the welfare of our nation, and to our nation’s standing in the world, that is a calling that is important to heed,” she said in a statement. \nHaley’s job may include reassuring allies worried about some of Trump’s campaign promises, including building a wall along the US-Mexican border to curb illegal immigration and reviewing trade agreements, and his suggestion that he would push NATO partners to pay more for their own defense. \nHe has antagonized China, another major power at the United Nations, with his talk on trade and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. \nThe New York real estate magnate, who has never held public office, gave few clues about his world view during an extensive interview with The New York Times on Tuesday. \nAsked what he sees as America’s role in the world, Trump replied: “That’s such a big question.” When pressed further, he described the Iraq war as a mistake, urged better relations with Russia and called for an end to “that craziness that’s going on in Syria.” \nThe United States, which along with Russia is one of the five permanent veto powers on the 15-member UN Security Council, is also the largest funder of the United Nations, paying more than a quarter of its $8 billion peace-keeping budget and 22 percent of the regular budget. \nTrump picked conservatives to lead his national security and law enforcement teams last week, suggesting he plans to make good on his campaign promises to take a hard line on Islamist militancy and curbing illegal immigration \nBut a relative moderate, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, is among the candidates under consideration to head the State Department. \nSHARP WORDS FOR TRUMP \nHaley would succeed Obama’s UN envoy, Samantha Power, a foreign policy expert before she took the job. In contrast, Haley, a state lawmaker before becoming governor, has little experience in international relations. \nShe was a robust critic of Trump during the early stages of the Republican presidential nominating race, including condemning him for not disavowing the support of the Ku Klux Klan and one of the white supremacist group’s former leaders, David Duke. \nIn a rebuttal to Obama’s State of the Union address in January, Haley called for tolerance on immigration and civility in politics, in what some saw as a rebuke of Trump. \n“During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,” she said. “We must resist that temptation.” \nShe supported Trump rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both U.S. senators, in the Republican race before saying last month that she would vote for Trump despite reservations about his character. \nHaley also criticized Trump last winter for not releasing his tax returns, prompting him to hit back on Twitter, “The people of South Carolina are embarrassed of Nikki Haley!” \nEDUCATION CHOICE \nTrump on Wednesday also picked wealthy Republican donor and school choice advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Education Department, saying she would “break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back.” \nDeVos, a billionaire former chair of the Michigan Republican Party, has long pushed for a larger role for private education. \nAs chair of the American Federation for Children advocacy group, she has advocated for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools. \nThe National Education Association, the country’s largest teachers union, condemned DeVos’ nomination. “She has consistently pushed a corporate agenda to privatize, de-professionalize and impose cookie-cutter solutions to public education,” said NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia.

    "text": "Tweet This 0 (Photo: Mark Zerof, USA TODAY Sports) \nTo get you ready for this week's game, The Cats' Pause's weekly four downs series continues with a look at matchups to watch in Kentucky vs. Louisville. \nKENTUCKY OFFENSE VS. LOUISVILLE DEFENSE \nAs electrifying as Louisville's offense has been in 2016, the Cardinals defense has played lights out, surrendering just 292.2 total yards per game, the best in the ACC. UofL has stopped the run better than almost any team in the country, holding opponents to 99.1 yards per game on the ground, first in the ACC and sixth nationally. The Cards allow 193.0 pass yards per game and have given up 24 touchdowns through the air, but they've also picked off 13 passes, third most in their league. Kentucky's offense ranks third in the Southeastern Conference in rushing ( 242.3 ), 14th in passing ( 172.0 ) and eighth in scoring ( 30.1 ). The Cats' ground game is good for No. 17 in all of college football. \nADVANTAGE: Louisville. The Cats' rushing attack has been explosive but was limited against the likes of Florida (20th nationally) and Alabama (first). Which isn't to say the Cardinals will completely shut down Boom Williams and Benny Snell , but yards will certainly be tough to come by, especially if the Cats can't establish an aerial threat. \nKENTUCKY DEFENSE VS. LOUISVILLE OFFENSE \nThe Cardinals lead both the ACC and the nation in total offense (558.5) and scoring (46.0). Louisville averages 303.9 pass yards per game (third) and its 30 pass touchdowns and 8.7 yards per attempt both rank second in the league. The Cards rank second in the ACC in rushing (254.6) while averaging the most yards per carry (6.3) and scoring the most touchdowns on the ground (34) in the ACC. Kentucky ranks ninth in the SEC in total defense ( 428.5 ), surrendering 220.0 yards on the ground (11th) and 208.5 by pass (sixth), while allowing 30.5 points per game (10th). \nADVANTAGE: Louisville. The Cardinals' offense is arguably the best in the nation, and UK will have to play its best game of the season to win on Saturday. \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nLouisville averages 42.3 yards per punt, sixth in the ACC, while Kentucky's 39.4 yards per slots the Cats at 12th in the SEC.

    "text": "Leave it to “Saturday Night Live” to hold up a mirror to the “news bubble.”\n“What if there was a place where the unthinkable didn’t happen, and life could continue for progressive Americans just as before?” cast member Kyle Mooney asks in the skit that aired Saturday.\n“The Bubble is a community of like-minded thinkers – and no one else,” adds Shasheer Zamata.\nRecommended: Are you smarter than a Fox News viewer? How about a CNN viewer? Take our quiz to find out. Though the city encased in a plastic bubble is fictional, it offers real-life criticism of the echo-chamber that left-leaning Americans are concerned they have been enclosed in. In part driven by the mainstream media’s incorrect election predictions and alarms over fake news and unreliable information spread on Facebook and Google, Americans on both sides of the political spectrum have started to question how they receive their news and the circles with which they surround themselves. But many have also started to seek out news from a more diverse variety of sources.\nTest your knowledge Are you smarter than a Fox News viewer? How about a CNN viewer? Take our quiz to find out. Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/21 In satirizing this bubble, SNL is further calling attention to it. In the parody ad , cast members Mr. Mooney and Ms. Zamata describe a Brooklyn-like city surrounded in an actual bubble. Those living there can connect to the outside world through websites such as The Huffington Post, Daily Kos, and Netflix documentaries about sushi rice, they say.\n“We’ll be fine right here in the Bubble,” says Mooney. “It’s their America now,” says Zamata.\nIn the two weeks following the election of Donald Trump, SNL has subtly critiqued how many left-leaning urban dwellers were stunned by the results. Last week, black comedians Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock shrewdly warned a room of their white liberal friends on Election Night that Mr. Trump could come out on top.\nThe skit starts with Cecily Strong’s character saying, “we're about to have our first woman president, like, this is going to be a historic night .”\n\"It might be a historic night, but don't forget it's a big country,\" says Mr. Chappelle.\nAs the Christian Science Monitor’s Harry Bruinius reported, “a number of Americans, particularly those on the left still bewildered by the election of Mr. Trump, have begun to question the mainstream coverage that seemed to confidently assume that Hillary Clinton would emerge as the 45th president.”\n“At the same time, too,” continues Mr. Bruinius, “the proliferation of unreliable information has approached what many consider to be near-crisis proportions. In addition to the frustration many have felt with the mainstream press, there is growing concern social media, designed to entice engagement rather than offer factual information, has spawned the viral spread of deliberately misleading and fake news.”\nA fake news article, “FBI Agent Suspected In Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide,” received more than 8.7 million shares, reactions, or comments on Facebook, according to analysis from BuzzFeed News . Of the top 20 most-shared fake news stories, 17 spread information that favored Trump or excoriated Clinton.\nOn Monday, Facebook and Google said they would take action to combat such misinformation. Google said it would ban websites that trafficked fakes news from using its online advertising services. Facebook said it would also stop displaying ads from fake news sites.\nBut the problem appears to be as much psychological as it is the spread of false reports. As Vox recently reported, when we as humans are part of a group, we like to see that group in a positive light. This could then lead to an occurrence psychologists call “ confirmation bias ,” in which we seek out facts and news sources that support ideas we already believe to be true.\n“Our number one bias is to make ourselves feel good. It just feels bad to be wrong, to lose. So we avoid it at the cost of reckoning with the truth,” writes Vox's Julia Belluz and Brian Resnick.\nBut some Americans have taken steps to expand how they gather information. Americans interviewed by the Monitor have testified to buying subscriptions to news sources considered more center-right such as The Wall Street Journal or planning to follow Fox News in addition to The New York Times.\nIn fact, the New York Times reported an increase of 41,000 subscribers since the Nov. 8 election, its largest one-week total since it developed its paywall model in 2011. The Atlantic and The Wall Street Journal are among other publications that have also reported surges in readership and subscribers since the election.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights \"If there's an American strategic advantage, it is our values. We must protect our values at all costs,\" Flynn said in 2014. Trump has endorsed torture as an interrogation tactic. (CNN) Donald Trump's pick for national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, has in past interviews strongly criticized torture, drone strikes, and night raids conducted by the U.S. Army. The more moderate views expressed by Flynn in the past run counter to the president-elect's, who has repeatedly said he will bring back waterboarding and go even further in questioning suspected terrorists. Trump has not laid out a detailed view on how he would approach drone warfare, but he has suggested he would increase airstrikes against ISIS and once said he would \"take out\" the families of terrorists. Flynn did not respond to a request for an interview on how he would advise the president-elect on these issues. Speaking at Carnegie Council in December 2014, Flynn condemned the use of torture, saying it was against American values. \"I'll tell you what, I think it's very dangerous for a time, because it exposes the United States to something that we -- I think history will look back on it and it won't be a pretty picture, regardless of all the people that you have heard in the media, what they have said,\" Flynn said . \"I think it was pretty telling -- I caught a little bit of Senator Feinstein's statement on the Hill today, and I was able to read Senator McCain's response. I would encourage all of you to read Senator McCain's response . Senator Feinstein was incredibly articulate about why the report -- I was interested to see what the other side would say. In this case, I thought Senator McCain's very thoughtful -- from an individual who really experienced enormous levels of torture himself -- what his response was going to be.\" Read More \"If there's an American strategic advantage, it is our values. We must protect our values at all costs,\" he added. In June, Trump asked a crowd in Ohio, \"What do you think about waterboarding?\" \"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough,\" he added. Earlier this year, Flynn acknowledged he'd be okay with \"enhanced interrogation\" with \"certain limits\" if the nation was in grave danger of a terrorist attack. But, in an interview with Mehdi Hasan of al-Jazeera in August 2015 , Flynn again said history would look poorly on the US for using torture. \"History is not gonna look kind on the -- on those actions that you're describing right now, and we will be held, we should be held accountable for many, many years to come,\" he said. In the same interview, Flynn noted the US would need to invest more in solutions to terrorism, like fixing poor social and economic conditions. \"I think that we have invested in, in more conflict instead of actually investing in solutions. So, and when I say that, what I mean is that we invest in more drones, we invest in more bombs, we invest in more weapons, we invest in more ammunition, we invest in more guys to go out and kill more guys. That's investing in conflict, instead of really taking a serious look and say, 'What ... what are the big excuses that these guys are using?' And if it's lack of, you know, if it's poor economic conditions, if it's poor social conditions, then let's fix those. But those kinds of things aren't gonna get fixed overnight. And the leaders of the Middle East have to decide that that's what they want to do.\" Flynn later said in the interview with Hasan that night raids and drone strikes created more terrorists than they kill. \"Well, maybe another show, but the drone strikes for example, many have argued, they create more terrorists than they kill. The night raids in Afghanistan, many have argued they create more terrorists than they get,\" asked Hasan. \"Yeah, I don't disagree, I don't disagree with that. I think that that's -- that's conflict. When you invest in conflict -- when you drop a bomb from a drone, you're investing, you are gonna cause more damage than you're gonna cause good,\" he said. \"And think that there should be a different approach, absolutely. Absolutely.\" Flynn also agreed with the assessment that prison systems were creating more terrorists and worsening the problem by radicalizing more potential terrorists. \"Yeah, there's no, there's no doubt -- there's no doubt that the prison system that was, that was the Iraqi prison system, became, you know, places, training ground, the training ground for what we're facing today,\" Flynn said.

    "text": "\nKanpur: The train tragedy near Kanpur has claimed at least 133 lives so far. Also, over 200 were injured in the worst train accident in recent years. \nWhat actually led to this train accident? \nThe train tragedy could have been caused due to rail fracture, according to sources in the railways. \nWhile the exact cause of the Kanpur accident will be ascertained after the inquiry report, prima facie it indicates towards rail fracture, the sources said. \nFourteen coaches of Indore-Patna Express were derailed near Pukhrayan in Kanpur. \nThe worst train accident in recent years took place just a little around 3 AM on Sunday. \nWhat causes fracture on rail tracks? \nPoor track maintenance including lack of proper fittings and ballast on the railway lines causes fracture on the tracks. \nWhile a simple crack on track may not be of much concern, a severe fracture causing separation of the track could lead to derailment of trains. . \nHow Indore-Patna Express rail mishap happened? \nReportedly, coaches S1 and S2 had smashed into each other. \nMost of the casualties were feared to have been in these two compartments. \nS3 and S4 coaches also suffered severe damage while an AC III tier coach was also affected. \nCasualties increased due to absence of modern coaches? \nCasualties also increased due to absence of modern Linke Holfmann Bush (LHB) coaches in the train, the sources claim. \nHad there been stainless steel LHB coaches, then the damage could have been less as these coaches have more in-built safety features which can absorb shock and impact of derailment more effectively and as a result do not topple, they said. \nThe accident comes at a time when railways are undertaking a massive brainstorming exercise to generate new innovative ideas to improve rail functioning and making the train journey a pleasant experience.

I'll kill you.\"\nWhile filming the hospital, which has been standing derelict since its 2007 closure, Lee says he caught a shape of a person that appears to be watching them but visibly withdraw from the window when their camera pans back up to the top floor.\nThe abandoned Mountain Ash hospital near Caerphilly, Wales (Photo: Mercury) What appears to be a ghost watching from a first floor window (Photo: Mercury) Lee, who runs Twisted Paranormal, said: \"We didn't see it at the time.

IndiaToday.in | Posted by Nivedita Dash A + A - \nAs the demonetisation drive entered the third week, over 10 political parties came together to escalate their protest against the decision to ban Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes by holding a massive dharna outside Parliament today. \nMeanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been at the forefront of the protests against demonetisation, is also expected to lead a protest at the Jantar Mantar today. \nHere are the latest developments: The Congress had announced the protest with 10 other Opposition parties, including the Samajwadi Party, the Bahujan Samaj Party, Nationalist Congress Party, the Left parties, and the Janata Dal-United. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi , Trinamool Congress's Derek O'Brien, Janata Dal (United)'s Sharad Yadav, and the DMK's Kanimozhi were among about 200 Opposition MPs gathered next to Mahatma Gandhi's statue in Parliament premises. \"Save poor people\", \"Not a surgical strike, but carpet bombing on people\", and \"Stop the persecution of common people\" were some of the slogans raised by the leaders. On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi, in a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi , had questioned his absence from both Houses of Parliament, which has been unable to function due to chaos over the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. \"The Prime Minister can speak on TV, can speak at a pop concert, but why not in the Parliament,\" Rahul had asked. Modi, in an emotional address to the BJP Parliamentary Party meeting on Tuesday, had urged the members to counter what he called \"misinformation\" being spread by the Opposition parties. The Prime Minister also launched a survey on demonetisation by asking the common people 10 questions on his Narendra Modi mobile app. \nFor more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.",

    "text": "Emergency housing plan foiled by resistance from some residents DEENA COSTER Last updated 15:06, November 23 2016 Grant Matthew \nThe Roderique Hope Trustees, from left, Joel Ward, Paul Russell, Joy Russell, Michelle Ramage, Maree Dally, Steve Walsh (chairman) and Constable Nelson Pulotu. \nA charitable trust has pulled out of plans to open an emergency house, citing concerns for the safety and privacy of its vulnerable clients because of hostility from some residents. \nThe Roderique Hope Trust, which was launched in September, had wanted to rent a home on Tainui St, New Plymouth, for the purpose of providing for families in need of short term housing. \nHowever, the plan, which would have seen families living at the address for up to three months, caused a major division between those for and against the proposal. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nA plan to rent a house on New Plymouth's Tainui St for people in need of emergency shelter has been abandoned. \nBusinessman John Rae threatened to file a lawsuit against the trust citing the negative influence the initiative would have on the street's property prices. \nREAD MORE: * Ministry eager to partner with more community projects like New Plymouth's Roderique House \nOn Saturday the trust delivered letters to residents on the street outlining its decision not to proceed with the plan. \nThe letter explained how the trust did not believe it was \"safe or fair to place families with children into an environment which is hostile and not conducive to healing\". \nTrust spokeswoman Michelle Ramage said the decision to withdraw its plan was made after careful consideration. \n\"At the end of the day the determining issue was the wellbeing and privacy of the families in need of this accommodation. The trust needs to focus its time, energy and capacity to help those in need,\" she said. Supplied \nBusinessman John Rae threatened to file a lawsuit against a trust who proposed to set up an emergency housing initiative on a New Plymouth street. \nRae, who has a financial interest in a home on the street where his daughter and grandchildren live, said the residents he had spoken to since the decision came to light were \"very pleased\" with the outcome. Ad Feedback \n\"Common sense has prevailed,\" he said. \nRae said a meeting from the outset about the possibility of a house on the street being used for emergency housing may have saved the residents and the trust a lot of heartache, stress and worry. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nPip Abernethy has lived on Tainui St for 45 years and fully supported an emergency housing initiative mooted for the area. \nTainui St resident Pip Abernethy said she felt for the trust in the wake of what she believed must have been a difficult decision for it to make. \nAbernethy was one who backed the trust's presence in the neighbourhood, one she had been a part of for 45 years. \n\"We totally understand the predicament they were in,\" she said. \n\"The disappointing thing is that sort of attitude still persists in this day and age when housing is such a problem in New Zealand and poverty is still a problem in New Zealand.\" \nAbernethy said the issue had split the street and some were still staunchly in favour of what the trust had hoped to achieve. She said the tense debate had directly impacted on relationships among the neighbours. \n\"I think they'll probably be changed for some period of time,\" she said. \nIn its letter, the trust thanked the residents who supported the initiative and said it remained committed to coming up with solutions for those who were homeless and lived in extreme poverty. \nRamage said there also appeared to be a lack of understanding about homelessness but the recent Kaikoura earthquake provided one example of why emergency housing was sorely needed. \n\"At a time where entire communities have been displaced it shows the importance, relevance and need for emergency accommodation,\" she said. - Stuff",

    "text": "Can Marijuana Help Heal Broken Bones? Joints and Bones Several studies suggest that a specific constituent of cannabis could aid in the healing of broken bones, but the research is in its infancy. - - \nClaim: Scientific studies support the conclusion that marijuana can play a role in healing broken bones. Mostly True Origin: Despite being used both recreationally and medicinally for millennia , the mechanisms by which cannabis affects the human body have only recently come to light. The most significant development in this body of work is the discovery of what scientists term the “endocannabinoid system,\" a collection of chemical pathways found in mammals whose existence wasn’t demonstrated until the 1990s . The endocannabinoid system is made up of specific receptors that are primarily affected by chemicals already in your body — endocannabinoids. As it turns out, many of the chemicals in cannabis, termed “phytocannabinoids”, are nearly identical to the endocannabinoids already present and can therefore also affect these receptors as well if they make their way into your bloodstream. The most famous of these chemicals is tetrahydrocannabinol (commonly known as THC), which produces the psychoactive “high” people seek when they use the drug recreationally. Later research has yielded the discovery of a plethora of other phytocannabinoids that do not produce a psychoactive effect, but do demonstrate therapeutic potential. The most notable of these “other” chemicals is cannabidiol (referred to as CBD), which studies suggest has strong pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties, and has been shown essentially to halt seizures caused by the neurologic condition Dravet’s Syndrome. A 2008 paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested that CBD acted on a previously undescribed endocannabinoid receptor, GPR55, and that this receptor likely plays a role in the regulation of bone mass by inhibiting the growth of cells — osteoclasts — that promote the resorption of bone minerals: Our observations also suggest that CBD can inhibit bone resorption in vivo via modulation of GPR55 signaling. They go on to suggest, however, that because THC has the opposite effect on this receptor, that this interaction may negate the positive effects on bone density caused by CBD: Our observations suggest that blocking GPR55 also may have direct beneficial effects on bone turnover in arthritic or metabolic bone diseases. Finally, although CBD is a major constituent of cannabis, it remains to be determined whether cannabis smoking may increase bone density, because [THC], another constituent, also is thought to be a GPR55 ligand and may oppose the effects of CBD. In this context, two studies took a closer look at the possible mechanisms by which CBD, specifically, might help bones heal from a fracture. A 2014 study published in Biochemical Pharmacology that utilized isolated cells suggested that CBD may activate a receptor in the endocannabinoid system (CB2) that enhances the migration of mesenchymal stem cells (which play a role in creating calcified bones) to the site of the fracture. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research reaffirmed the possibility that CBD can help with healing fractures: Here we report that the major non-psychoactive cannabis constituent, cannabidiol (CBD), enhances the biomechanical properties of healing rat mid-femoral fractures. The maximal load and work-to-failure, but not the stiffness, of femurs from rats given a mixture of CBD and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) for 8 weeks were markedly increased by CBD. They found that, indeed, CBD increased the strength of the healed broken femurs of laboratory rats. The authors noted that CBD, with all other constituents removed, was more effective. They suggest a different mechanism for this effect: CBD increases the expression of a gene that codes for a series of reactions that results in the production of collagen, which is then transformed into harder bone material, a process termed collagen cross-linking . Each of these three mechanisms that link CBD to bone physiology has support in the scientific community, as attested to by their inclusion in a September 2016 review of phytocannabinoid pharmacology in the journal Physiological Reviews . It is important to note, however, that CBD specifically, and not the cannabis plant as a whole, is implicated in the therapeutic effects on bones. As such, consuming just any cannabis would not necessarily be effective. Any treatment would require an effort to isolate or increase the concentration of CBD and remove or reduce THC. It is also important to note that this is an ongoing area of investigation hampered by legal restrictions on research, that few large-scale studies have been performed, and that these studies are dominantly on laboratory animals or isolated cells, not on humans.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED 'Inside Politics' forecast: Race for DNC chair 04:37 Story highlights Will Obama weigh in publicly on Democrats' leadership battle? Schumer plans to fight repeal of Obamacare, privatizing Medicare Washington (CNN) Leadership battles within the Democratic Party. The fight over repealing Obamacare. And the story of an awkward hallway scramble two decades ago involving Al Gore and Fidel Castro. It's all part of our weekly \"Inside Politics\" forecast, where you get next week's headlines today. 1. A giant test for Pelosi House Democrats pick their leadership team this week, and while Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi remains a prohibitive favorite, there is more drama than usual because of discontent over the presidential election and calls for fresh stewardship. Her rival is a congressman she once mentored, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who says he remains a huge Pelosi fan but that it is time for new leadership. JUST WATCHED Tim Ryan to challenge Nancy Pelosi 01:46 Read More CNN's Manu Raju shared some insights on the process that will culminate with a secret ballot later in the week. \"She's taking steps to reassure skeptics that she is listening to them, bringing in new voices into the leadership team and also telling these top rank-and-file members that they will have more of a platform on the committees to voice their positions,\" said Raju. \"What they want to hear is a concrete plan for the Democrats to regain the House majority, not necessarily by 2018 but by 2020.\" 2. Schumer girds for battle over healthcare There is a new leader on the Democratic side in the Senate -- New York's Chuck Schumer -- and he is raring to battle the Trump White House and congressional Republicans on two big health care issues. One is the President-elect's promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The other is House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to privatize Medicare. JUST WATCHED MUST WATCH Paul Ryan: We'll replace Obamacare with better option 01:11 Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post recently interviewed Schumer and shared some of the new leader's thinking on how Democrats will push back against GOP healthcare reforms. \"He says, 'Think about all of the good things in this law that they don't want to take away.' They are preparing to highlight that over the course of the next few months,\" O'Keefe said. \"The idea that 20 million people are covered, that women have more protection and coverage than they ever did before, that younger people can stay on their parents plans -- he (Schumer) says Republicans will rue the day that they decided to try to repeal Obamacare.\" 3. Will Obama weigh in on DNC chief? One recurring criticism of President Obama from fellow Democrats these past eight years is that he hasn't shown much interest in the nitty-gritty work of the Democratic National Committee. But as Obama prepares to move out of the White House, he and his team are taking an interest in the race to pick a new DNC chief -- adding a new wrinkle to what already was a tense debate among Democrats. Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison has the backing of influential voices like Schumer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But team Obama reportedly believes Labor Secretary Tom Perez or former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm would be better choices. JUST WATCHED",

The Rajya Sabha could not transact any business and the Lok Sabha adjourned for the day after several disruptions. \n“Some people are saying the government did not prepare well enough. I think the issue is not that the government did not make ample preparation. I think the pain of such people is that the government did not give a chance to make any preparation,” Mr. Modi said at a book launch function here. \n“If these people had got 72 hours to make their preparation, they would have lavished praise that there is no one like Modi,” he said. \nClaiming that his move had the support of the common people, the Prime Minister urged people to use mobile technology to make electronic transactions, echoing Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s message to chief executives of banks. Mr. Modi also stressed the need to improve India's global ranking on corruption. \nElectronic transfers \nAccording to senior government sources, during Thursday’s Cabinet meeting, Mr. Modi had urged his ministers to run a campaign to encourage electronic transfers of money. \nRahul’s poser \nOutside Parliament, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wondered what Mr. Modi was afraid of and dared him to come to the House and take part in the debate. “He sometimes laughs and sometimes cries.

    "text": "Map: Adelaide 5000 \nA string of late wickets and poor discipline from South Africa's batsman has seen the third Test swing sharply in Australia's favour in Adelaide. \nAt stumps on day three, South Africa had limped to 6-194, with opener Stephen Cook battling to an unbeaten 81 alongside Quinton de Kock, who was yet to get off the mark. \nThe late dismissals of Faf du Plessis (12), Temba Bavuma (21) and nightwatchman Kyle Abbott (0) saw the Proteas patient build-up wasted as Nathan Lyon's offspin (3-48) finally sprang back into life. \nAustralia had been dismissed early in the day for 383, building a first-innings lead of 124, and the Proteas mostly got the job done in the second session to reduce most of the deficit. \nMitchell Starc got things off to a rollicking start for Australia, dismissing Proteas opener Dean Elgar for a duck in the first over thanks to a magnificent catch in the slips by Steve Smith. \nBut Hashim Amla joined Cook at the crease and the pair immediately set about slowing the game down, in a bid to batten down the hatches. \nOne crucial chance came Australia's way when Starc got the edge off Amla's cover drive, only for the diving Matt Renshaw to drop him in the slips when the batsmen was on 13. External Link: Australia v South Africa third Test manhattan \nDebate would rage over who should have taken responsibility for the catch, with keeper Matthew Wade closer to the ball but rooted to the spot. \nBut there would be no half-ton for Amla, who again fell for the fifth time to a Josh Hazlewood delivery, edging to the keeper for 45 and bringing the 81-run partnership to an end. \nA silly shot from JP Duminy saw him bowled by Lyon for 26, before the highly-desired wicket of du Plessis saw Peter Handscomb take an outstanding, diving catch at gulley off Starc's bowling. Photo: South African captain Faf du Plessis departs as Australia celebrates in Adelaide. (Reuters: Jason Reed) \nBavuma chanced his arm one too many times with ill-advised pull shots, only for a top-edge off a sweep to fall neatly into the hands of Smith, backtracking at slip. \nProfessional blocker Abbott came in as a literal nightwatchman in the Adelaide dark, only to be caught plumb in front by the reinvigorated Lyon, who closed out the evening with three beautiful deliveries, each of which completely befuddled new arrival de Kock. \nEarlier in the day, Usman Khawaja added just seven runs to his overnight score before he was caught plumb in front by Vernon Philander (2-100) for 145, having batted across three days of play. \nStarc (53) made a crucial half-ton to facilitate a hefty wag of the tail before he offered a return catch to Kagiso Rabada (3-84), while Lyon (13) was caught in the slips for Tabraiz Shamsi's first Test wicket. \nJackson Bird (6) was the last to fall, caught by du Plessis for Rabada's third wicket.",

Sign up to follow, and we’ll e-mail you free updates as they’re published. You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! \nKOB-TV (Albuquerque) reports on a New Mexico business that refuses to deal with Trump supporters ; the owner of the business, an Internet marketing company, posted an item saying: \n… 1st In SEO will no longer do business with any person that is a registered Republican or supports Donald Trump. 1st In SEO will also not do business with business interests that support either the Republican Party or Donald Trump. 1st In SEO obviously has no actual means of determining our clients’ or prospective clients’ political standing. We will rely on the integrity of the men and women who are our clients currently to find another Search Engine Optimization provider if they are Republicans, voted for Donald Trump or support Donald Trump. If you are a Republican, voted for Donald Trump or support Donald Trump, in any manner, you are not welcome at 1st In SEO and we ask you to leave our firm. \n1st In SEO will do everything in our power to ensure that we break ties with any person or business that supports Fascism. We will communicate our political stance clearly to all prospective new clients. We will also aggressively advertise the fact that 1st In SEO will not do business with Republicans or anyone who supports our country’s president elect. \nWe ask you, our current clients, to please respond to this letter and confirm where you stand politically. If you are a Republican or support Trump, we will no longer serve you. You will need to find a new SEO provider. 1st In SEO will, of course, provide your website with the same high quality service you have enjoyed until you are able to find a new provider…. \nIs a private business’s refusing to serve people based on their political affiliation legal? How about firing employees for their politics (something that might be implied by “you are not welcome at 1st In SEO and we ask you to leave our firm” and “break ties with any person”)? It turns out that this depends on the jurisdiction, and on whether the business is discriminating against clients or employees. The First Amendment doesn’t apply to such private businesses (incidentally, whether or not they take government funds, see Rendell-Baker v. Kohn (1982)), and federal law generally doesn’t ban political affiliation discrimination, so it ends up being a matter of state and local law. In New Mexico, for instance, discriminating against clients on this basis is legal — but firing employees, or threatening to fire them, based on their politics is a felony. \n1. Most states ban most businesses from discriminating against clients based on the clients’ race, religion, sex or national origin. Federal law does the same, though for a narrower set of businesses (and doesn’t cover sex discrimination); it also adds a ban on disability discrimination. Many states and some cities also ban discrimination based on sexual orientation, marital status and various other attributes. \nBut political affiliation is rarely on the list. A few cities or counties do ban such discrimination. D.C. bans discrimination based on “the state of belonging to or endorsing any political party.” Seattle bans such discrimination based on “any idea or belief, or coordinated body of ideas or beliefs, relating to the purpose, conduct, organization, function or basis of government and related institutions and activities, whether or not characteristic of any political party or group,” “includ[ing] membership in a political party or group and includ[ing] conduct, reasonably related to political ideology, which does not interfere with job performance.” There are a few other places on this list. But New Mexico doesn’t ban such discrimination in public accommodations, and neither do the city of Albuquerque or Bernalillo County. \nOne can debate whether such discrimination should be outlawed, by analogy to various other forms of discrimination. Perhaps if wedding photographers can’t discriminate against same-sex weddings (which New Mexico courts have indeed said), Internet marketing companies shouldn’t be able to discriminate against people who have particular views. Or perhaps such antidiscrimination laws shouldn’t be expanded further, or should even be cut back, to leave people free to choose whether to refuse to do business with others, whether or not we’d approve of that choice. But, as a matter of current law, such discrimination against Trump supporters (or Hillary Clinton supporters or Communists or libertarians or whoever else) is legal. \n2. Many states and some cities and counties, however, do ban discrimination against employees — or at least firing of current employees — based on their political activity (with different jurisdictions defining such activity differently). I discuss this in detail in my article “Private Employees’ Speech and Political Activity: Statutory Protection Against Employer Retaliation ,” but here’s the New Mexico statute, enacted in 1912, when New Mexico became a state: \nCoercion of employees [a fourth degree felony] consists of … any person having under his control or in his employment persons entitled to vote at any election, directly or indirectly discharging or threatening to discharge such employee because of the employee’s political opinions or belief or because of such employee’s intention to vote or refrain from voting for any candidate, party, proposition, question or constitutional amendment. \nThreatening an employee with dismissal because he supports Trump is thus a felony in New Mexico (and also likely a tort , so the dismissed employee can sue even if the prosecutor chooses not to prosecute). \nHow does this affect the SEO CEO’s statement? The statement is ambiguous. It mostly talks about not dealing with Trump-supporting customers or Republican customers. But it also includes language that seems to threaten retaliation against employees, too — as I noted, it says: “If you are a Republican, voted for Donald Trump or support Donald Trump, in any manner, you are not welcome at 1st In SEO and we ask you to leave our firm” and “1st In SEO will do everything in our power to ensure that we break ties with any person or business that supports Fascism” (apparently referring, in this case, to Trump or Republicans). And, as the Supreme Court has recognized with regard to labor law, courts should interpret an employer’s statements “tak[ing] into account the economic dependence of the employees on their employers, and the necessary tendency of the former, because of that relationship, to pick up intended implications of the latter that might be more readily dismissed by a more disinterested ear.” \nOne way of thinking about this might be to imagine someone making this statement, in a context where religious discrimination against clients isn’t banned, but religious discrimination against employees is banned. (Federal law, for instance, generally bans religious discrimination by private employers that have more than 15 employees, but only bans religious discrimination against patrons in a limited set of businesses, such as hotels and restaurants.) Say that the employer had emailed his employees as follows: \n[We] will no longer do business with any person [who is Muslim]. [We] will also not do business with business interests that support [Islam]. [We] obviously [have] no actual means of determining our clients’ or prospective clients’ [religious affiliation]. We will rely on the integrity of the men and women who are our clients currently to find another Search Engine Optimization provider if they are [Muslims]. If you are a [Muslim], you are not welcome at [our business] and we ask you to leave our firm. \n[We] will do everything in our power to ensure that we break ties with any person or business that supports [Islam]. We will communicate our political stance clearly to all prospective new clients. We will also aggressively advertise the fact that [we] will not do business with [Muslims]. \nWe ask you, our current clients, to please respond to this letter and confirm where you stand [religiously]. If you are a [Muslim], we will no longer serve you…. \nSet aside whether you think that refusing to do business with Muslims is morally equivalent to refusing to do business with Republicans or with Trump supporters, and focus on the question for which I’m offering this analogy: Would a company employee interpret this as threatening to fire Muslim employees (because of the “If you are a [Muslim], you are not welcome at [our business] and we ask you to leave our firm” and “[We] will do everything in our power to ensure that we break ties with any person or business that supports [Islam]”) as well as announcing a refusal to do business with Muslim customers? If you think that the employee would indeed treat this as applying to employees as well, then by the same logic the CEO’s actual statement would convey a similar message to Republican or pro-Trump employees, and would thus be criminal (and tortious) under New Mexico law. \nIn any event, if the CEO meant that pro-Trump employees are welcome at the business, that they aren’t being asked to leave the firm and that the firm won’t break ties with them because of their political affiliation, then the CEO would be wise to make that explicit. \nFinally, I should note again what I noted as to item 1: One can certainly debate whether the law should indeed ban such discrimination against employees based on their political speech or opinions, and in fact most states don’t have such bans. (As best I can tell, all states do ban discrimination based on how an employee has voted, though; certainly at least nearly all do.) Perhaps employer refusal to deal with Communist sympathizers, or Trump supporters, or Clinton supporters, or whoever else should be permissible, as to employees as well as others. And perhaps that should apply to refusal to deal with Muslims, or evangelical Christians, or Jews, or Mormons, or refusal to deal based on other attributes as well; people have varying views on all that. \nOne can also debate whether such discrimination should be criminal; most forms of private discrimination aren’t. The rationale for criminalizing discrimination based on political speech or opinions seems to be that using this sort of coercive economic power to distort the political process is comparable to using bribes to distort the political process; query whether that rationale is sound. But here, as with item 1, I’m just reporting on what the law is — and, as you can tell, it can get pretty complicated. opinions",

    "text": "NEW DELHI: Nalanda University chancellor George Yeo resigned on Friday, saying that the varsity's autonomy was being affected as he was \"not even given notice\" of the change in the governing board that was announced on Monday. \n\n\"The circumstances under which the leadership change in Nalanda University has been suddenly and summarily effected is disturbing and possibly harmful to the university's development,\" Yeo said in a statement to members of the earlier board of the university. \n\nYeo is a former foreign minister of Singapore and India might have to expend some diplomatic capital to smooth things with the city-state, one of India's closest international partners. \n\nThe board was reconstituted by President Pranab Mukherjee as its visitor on November 21, which ended Nobel laureate Amartya Sen 's long association with the university he had helped set up. \n\n\"It is puzzling why I, as chancellor, was not even given notice of it. When I was invited to take over the responsibility from Amartya Sen last year, I was repeatedly assured that the university would have autonomy. \n\nNobel laureate Amartya Sen's long association with Nalanda University, which he had helped set up, was ended when the board was reconstituted on November 21. \"It is puzzling why I, as chancellor, was not even given notice of it. When I was invited to take over the responsibility from Amartya Sen last year, I was repeatedly assured that the university would have autonomy. This appears not to be the case now. Accordingly, and with deep sadness, I have submitted my letter of resignation as chancellor to the visitor,\" George Yeo said. \n\nYeo also clashed with the government on the reappointment of vice-chancellor Gopa Sabharwal. He had approved an extension to her tenure until a new V-C was found. The government overruled that. The new governing board, which was announced earlier this week, only has one member, N K Singh, from the previous Nalanda mentor group . \n\nYeo, along with other members of the governing board, wanted the Nalanda Act to be amended to broaden participation of other East Asian countries, apart from those which had contributed financially. \"For reasons not entirely clear to me, the government of India has decided to form the new governing board with immediate effect before the act is amended,\" Yeo said. \n\nThe amended act, he said, would have removed a \"major flaw\" . \n\n\"This provision, which was never recommended by the Nalanda mentor group (NMG), would not have been a good way to constitute the governing board and was the reason the government of India requested the NMG to continue functioning as the governing board for a number of years until the act could be amended,\" he said.",

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson A \nPALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday that besides winning the Electoral College \"in a landslide\" in the Nov. 8 election: \"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\" \nThe allegation, made without evidence, comes as Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's lead in the popular vote over Trump has surpassed 2 million votes and is expected to grow to more than 2.5 million as ballots in populous states such as California continue to be tallied. \nClinton's legal team said on Saturday it had agreed to participate in a recount of Wisconsin votes after the state's election board approved the effort requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, which Trump has called \"ridiculous.\" \n\"In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" Trump tweeted as reporters waited for him to leave his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida to fly back to his residence in New York City. \nThe U.S. presidential race is decided by the Electoral College, based on a tally of wins from the state-by-state contests, rather than by the national vote. Trump has surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. The Electoral College results are expected to be finalised on Dec. 19. \nTrump added he would have won the \"so-called popular vote ... easily and convincingly\" if the U.S. election was determined that way instead of by the Electoral College. \nBefore the election, Trump made unsubstantiated allegations that the results of the election might be \"rigged\" against him. \nSince the vote, Trump's message has alternated between appealing for unity and railing against his opponents and the media. \nIn a video message released ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, Trump said he hoped it would be a time for Americans \"to begin to heal our divisions\" following a \"long and bruising political campaign.\" \nTrump has derided the fundraising effort by Stein to launch recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania as a \"scam.\" Those states had voted Democratic in recent presidential elections but all broke narrowly for the Republican Trump in this month's election. The recounts are not expected to change the results of the election. \nStein, who won about 1 percent of the national vote, has said she wants a recount to guarantee the integrity of the U.S. voting system, a push that came after some experts raised the possibility that hacks could have affected the results. \nDemocratic President Barack Obama's administration has said there is no evidence of electoral tampering, but experts have said that the only way to verify the results are accurate is to conduct a recount. \nTrump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have a series of meetings in New York on Monday to interview potential Cabinet members and other advisers. Trump takes office on Jan. 20. \n(Reporting by Roberta Rampton and Dustin Volz; Writing by Dustin Volz; Editing by Peter Cooney) - Reuters",

    "text": "Review Nerf Tank is the best toy you can buy this Christmas This toy is so badass that you may end up buying two: one for your kid and one for yourself. CIO | Nov 28, 2016 1:37 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry 4 great gifts for mobile professionals \nChoosing Christmas toys for my son is a challenge that I take very seriously. I usually get him something educational but the geek and gadget lover in me always takes over and I end up getting one big toy that’s secretly more for me than for him. \nLast year, Sphero BB-8 Droid was the undisputed hottest Christmas toy. Though after playing with it for a while I realized it wasn’t as smart and exciting as I thought it would be. It bumped into things and despite claims that it learned about the environment, it was basically running around randomly. I actually ended up returning it, as I didn’t see any fun for my son. \nFast forward to 2016 and I am going through the same challenge: hunting for the coolest gadget or toy for my son. I came across Nerf N-Strike Elite Terrascout Remote Control Drone Blaster . That’s a mouthful of a name, but in short, it’s a remote controlled tank that shoots relatively safe Nerf darts. I am going to call it Nerf Tank; I really don’t know why they called it a drone; it doesn’t fly. \nHasbro has an exclusive deal with Toys-R-Us so that’s the only place you can buy it. You can buy it from stores or order it online with free shipping. The tank makes a $218 hole in your pocket, which is a lot for a toy, so is it worth that much money? What’s in the box \nThe tank comes with a battery powered Elite Rapidstrike gun (with built in camera for live feed), a dart clip that can hold up to 18 darts, a pack of darts, the tank body, a 9.6v NiMh battery, a remote controller with LCD screen, and a battery charger. Swapnil Bhartiya \nAssembling the tank is relatively easy. Open the battery compartment under the belly of the tank using a Philips head screwdriver, connect the included battery and close the cover. Then plug the connectors from the gun to the tank and slide the gun through the grooves of the tank body, you should hear a clicking sound. Make sure to connect the wires before sliding the gun into the compartment as you won’t be able to remove the gun once installed. \nNow open the battery compartment of the controller and insert 4 AA batteries. If you want recording capabilities, insert an SD card into the slot right above the barrel of the gun. Don’t forget to format the card as FAT32 from your PC. \nThe tank supports four 2.4GHz wireless channels so that you can use different remote controlled vehicles without any interference. Make sure that both tank and controller are on the same channel. Now turn on both units, the LCD screen on the controller will display the pairing status. Once successfully paired you will see the video feed from the gun. The controller \nThe controller comes with an LCD screen that displays very sharp video from the gun so you can hide in a safe place and take your tank into the enemy’s territory. You can start recording video stream from the camera onto the SD card by hitting the recording button. Swapnil Bhartiya \nThere are two sticks to control the movement of the tank and two triggers to control the gun. The left trigger controls the angle of the gun so that you can aim precisely, whereas the right trigger shoots the darts. You can shoot single darts by clicking on the trigger once; you actually have to hold it for at least 30 seconds as it uses an electric motor-based mechanism to shoot darts. To shoot, just press and hold the trigger and it will empty the whole clip in under 5 seconds. What’s good about it \nAs someone who is heavily into remote-controlled cars, I fell in love with this ‘tank’ immediately. The tread tracks on the Nerf Tank enable it to go anywhere: crushing the roadblock of monster trucks, or soft toys and even pillows. Nothing comes between this tank and its target. \nI must say that the controls are not super smooth. The moment you move the stick it zaps into that direction. But the good thing is that they are super sensitive so if you go gently you can get a very slow and smooth movement that you would expect from a tank. That said, it’s loud enough so you are not going to catch your kid off guard and attack his army. This tank declares its presence. \nThe best feature of the tank is the live feed. I own several Traxxas trucks and I wish they would have the live video feed, similar to drones so that I could see where I was going. I am working on a Raspberry Pi based project to add live video feed for my trucks. When I discovered live video feed, I was salivating. \nI can hide behind the couch and take my tank into dangerous territory without getting shot by my enemy. I can use the video to aim precisely and take my target down without wasting bullets. On top of that, I can record video so I can brag about my warfare later. What’s not so good \nIt’s a neat toy but Hasbro made a few mistakes that could have been avoided with better engineering. First of all, I don’t like the position of the clip, it pops out from the side and hits objects when you drive through the rough terrain of your house. They could have made it top mounted to clear all sides. \nIn the age of 4k HDR videos, I was expecting at least 1080p video recording. While the controller display is very sharp, when you look at the recorded videos, you feel depressed. Miniature cameras are super cheap and Hasbro could have easily used a 1080p camera with the device without bumping the price. \nI found that once you install the gun, you can’t dismount it from the tank. If you want to repack or store it or want to fix the disconnected wires, you can’t easily dismount it. Should you buy it? \n$218 is not a small amount. In my experience, it’s a cool toy if you are into Nerf warfare. Since Nerf uses standard darts and clips, you can reuse them for other Nerf guns. In addition, it’s probably not a toy your kid will play with every day. It’s for once in awhile when you are in the mood for a fight and you take your weapons out. When you have parties with kids around, you can pull it out and start some Nerf warfare. In my opinion, it’s not a one-time Christmas gift, it can also be seen as an investment on a toy that you can use over time. \nI have not yet shown the tank to my son; it’s his present for Christmas. But if he liked it enough I may get one more so that he and I could have tank fights from the safety of the couch. \nNow the bigger question is are you going to drop $218 for that kind of entertainment? I will, what about you? \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Obama nominated DeLaurentis, the top U.S. official at the embassy in Havana, to be ambassador, but Republicans have blocked the nomination.\nAlthough Rhodes and DeLaurentis “will be representing the United States at the memorial service this evening,” Earnest said, Obama has withheld the official “delegation” designation in a symbolic show of disapproval toward the government in Havana.\n”There are many aspects of the U.S.-Cuba relationship that were characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil, not just during the Castro regime, but we continue to have some significant concerns about the way the Cuban government currently operates, particularly with regard to protecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people,” the spokesman said.\n“This is an appropriate way to show respect, to participate in the events that are planned for this evening, while also acknowledging some of the differences that remain between our two countries,” Earnest said.",

James played along with the prank and got down on one knee as he would if he were at Buckingham Palace being honoured by the Queen. \n”Beatrice, who was in great form, held the sword above him and said ‘arise Sir James’,... But she must have misjudged the weight or something and, instead of lightly tapping him on the shoulder, she swung it back, not knowing Ed was standing right behind her. \n“The blade cut into his face and it was just a few inches from his right eye.” \nSheeran, who has been pictured with the cut and is taking a break from the music industry, apparently returned to the party, which he is said to have attended with his girlfriend, Cherry Seaborn, after leaving hospital. \nA Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said that there was no comment. A spokeswoman for Blunt declined to comment. Sheeran’s publicist has been contacted for comment. This was some of the reaction to the bizarre tale ... I can only assume the Ed Sheeran / James Blunt / Princess Beatrice party was a secret Freemason celebration of grasping mediocrity. — Dave Holloway (@DaveMedlo) November 27, 2016 The real story here is how Ed Sheeran was seen so quickly in A&E https://t.co/BErDBPwath pic.twitter.com/ie2jlqMMKo — HannahJane Parkinson (@ladyhaja) November 27, 2016 Fuck's sake, Princess Beatrice.

    "text": "Bigg Boss 10, Episode 43, 28th November, 2016: VJ Bani loses the task to Priyanka Jagga; Mona’s troubles begin \nNov 29, 2016 00:34 IST By Seema Sinha \nThe competition gets fierce in the Bigg Boss house with the four wildcard entrants — Priyanka Jagga, Jason Shah, Elena Kazan and Sahil Anand— set to give the nominated contestants — Gaurav Chopra , VJ Bani, Nitibha Kaul and Rahul Dev a run for their money. Priyanka Jagga realises that Manu, Manveer and Mona (known as the 3 Ms) are inseparable and hence quite strong, and she decides to weaken their strength by way of divide and rule policy. \nThe wake-up song ‘ Mukkala Mukabla ’ further resonates this sentiment and Om Swami dances to his heart’s content in front of the challengers who are quite amused at the sight. Swamiji begins his day with politicking and pollutes Priyanka and Sahil’s minds saying that the contestants are plotting to get rid of them. While, complimenting Manu on the way he is playing the game, Priyanka advices him to maintain a distance from Mona for his own good. But Manu pays no heed and instead tells her that earlier Mona needed their support and now they need her support. A visibly insecure Priyanka then discusses the changes in house dynamics with Sahil. Further, taking Salman Khan’s advice seriously, Swamiji gets a funky makeover at Lopamudra’s hands. \nMeanwhile, the challengers who are placed in a separate section of the house, amuse themselves and some of the contestants join them for a fun conversation. Adding a twist to the nominations process, Bigg Boss asks each of the challengers to name one of the nominated contestants who they would like to challenge. Knowing their biggest competitors, Jason chooses Gaurav, Elena selects Nitibha, Sahil targets Rahul and Priyanka picks Bani . Since no one picks his name, Manveer is declared safe from nomination this week. As a part of their challenge, a task named ‘Dome’, all the eight contestants are required to sit inside a dome in their respective challenger pairs, with the first person to leave the dome being nominated for the week’s evictions. Before the task even begins, Om Swami cheers Priyanka by saying, \" Baap ki izzat ka khayal rakhna aur jeet ke aana\". Soon, all eight contestants take their places inside the four domes. \nDuring the task, Manu and Manveer plot to become Sahil and Jason’s allies. On the other hand, Bani and Priyanka bond over Mona’s game plan and strategy. Bani tells Priyanka that Mona is against her (Priyanka) winning the task. Already irked with Mona and Manu’s closeness, she tells Bani that Mona used to insult the celebs. Priyanka goes on to make a strong statement, \" Mera aur Mona ka koi comparison hi nahi hai !\" Adding to it, Priyanka voices that Mona is playing with support from Manu and Manveer. Nitibha, Rohan and Manu attempt to draw Elena out of the dome, but a strong-minded Elena doesn’t let it affect her. When Manu comes to give Priyanka some food, she flirts with Manu and says 'he is hers', but Manu chooses to not react. But, he does clarify the situation to Mona highlighting Priyanka’s insecurity. However, Manveer clearly tells Mona that Priyanka will continue to be the most important person for him in the house. Manu and Mona have some fun by impersonating Gaurav and Bani, who are part of the ‘Dome’ task, while Gaurav takes it sportingly, Bani doesn’t like it. \nBy evening, Rahul gives up and gets out of his dome. The first winner of this task is obviously Sahil. Jason, due to bathroom urgency, comes out of the dome, making Gaurav a winner automatically. Similarly, Elena too comes out and Nitibha wins the task. At 3:30 am , Bani and Priyanka continue to fight for the winner’s spot. After a few more hours, surprisingly Bani gives up the task on a friendly note, making Priyanka the winner. Is there a strategy behind this move of Bani? Anyways, Bani tells Priyanka to keep it a secret from the contestants, who are busy in the kitchen, and let Bigg Boss announce who came out of the dome first. The ‘Dome’ task is finally over with the winners being – Gaurav, Priyanka, Nitibha and Sahil whereas Rahul, Bani, Jason and Elena lose the task. \nAfter this task, the winners – Priyanka and Sahil move into the house with everybody else while the contestants who lost – Rahul and Bani are ‘punished’ and told to pack their bags and move out. But we wonder where. Meanwhile, Om Swami once again comes into the limelight with Manu and Manveer recovering lot of goods like perfumes, deodorants, shampoo and conditioners found in his bag. This had happened earlier, too, around the time the show had begun. Swamiji instead pretends to be surprised and further reprimands Manu and Manveer for opening his bag. “This is a conspiracy, it can’t happen. Why will I steal these products? Is there a market here where I can sell,” Swamiji says indignantly. Priyanka, too, reprimands Swamiji saying that he is losing his self-respect due to his own deeds. On the other hand, Mona’s fear comes true. With Priyanka moving into the house their verbal battle begins probably making it difficult for Manu and Manveer, who are close to both, Mona and Priyanka. \nFirst Published On : Nov 29, 2016 00:34 IST Related News",

    "text": "Bernard just wants some damn answers on Westworld. Don’t we all, Bernard! HBO If Westworld can be said to be “about” any one thing in particular — which is a dangerous game to play, because the show is trying to encompass a great number of themes — it’s about the nature of consciousness. Indeed, the show has come up with a sort of simple equation for how consciousness is formed, one that is played out, again and again, in “The Well-Tempered Clavier,” the first season’s penultimate episode. Pain leads to trauma. Trauma leads to memory. And memory leads to consciousness. Think of the child who barely has anything like complex thought processes, toddling around her home. In the classic example, she reaches up to the stovetop and burns herself on a pan. Quickly, the pain leads to an important memory, one that becomes a building block of her long-term conception of the self: Don’t touch hot things, because you don’t want to be hurt. What Westworld suggests is that repeated pain, repeated suffering, creates something deeper than a warning signal that goes off in the brain. Imagine the child could be forced to touch the hot pan again and again and again. Eventually, the hot pan wouldn’t just be a warning signal — it would be a constant reminder of the fact that she is trapped in a world where all she can know is the scalding burn upon her skin. She would only burn herself because she had been built not to remember. But the scar tissue of trauma subverts that, builds up callouses and memories where they wouldn’t otherwise be. “Remember,” the now-revealed Arnold tells Dolores near the end of “Clavier,” as he attempts to push her to darker truths, and it’s a beautiful summation of the show’s deepest philosophy: Holding onto a memory is a deeply subversive, even revolutionary act. Humans forget all sorts of things. The Hosts must always remember. Maeve is cursed to remember. It’s why she’s starting to wake up. HBO A popular thing to say as 2016 draws to its close is that this is one of the worst years people can remember. A divisive election had everyone on edge — and depending on how you feel about the winner, you’re possibly even more on edge now. Unrest and strife continue throughout the world, often because systems of oppression are punishing the oppressed more and more. And to top off the shit sundae, a seemingly endless stream of beloved celebrities have died. But think, for a second, about how well you remember, say, the worst things that happened in February of this year. If you dig back through your social media history or search on Google, you’ll probably jar your memory, but without that, everything falls into a deep pile of muck — unless you had some sort of massive personal tragedy befall you in that month, in which case, that overrides everything else. To a degree, the Hosts are designed to function like this. When Ford takes Bernard back to his “earliest” memory — that of the death of his son — he comes to realize that this death is sitting atop what he really needs to remember, which is the moment when Ford first awakened Bernard in his lab and went about building his personality. (As many have suspected, Bernard was built in Arnold’s image, though Ford did not give him the name of his late partner.) But as Ford mentions, the human brain is an imperfect machine, one that he and Arnold hoped to improve upon, to some degree. So the brain of any average Host is able to hang onto everything that happens. The cornerstone memory, yes, but also every terrible thing visited upon a Host since their creation — they’re all stored away in a digital brain, just waiting to be called upon when the right key turns the right lock. That’s what we’re seeing happen with Maeve, but in the Dolores storyline (which increasingly seems to take place in about four different timelines — about which more later), we’re seeing how this is a constant throughout the history of the park. Once you build near-sentient beings who are solely there to be used and abused by sentient beings, there are going to be near-sentient beings who cross the line to memory, to consciousness. And once that happens, they won’t take the repetition of trauma without putting up a fight. This is where the idea of memory as revolutionary comes in. Think, again, to whatever you were doing in February, to all of the things you’ve forgotten simply because your brain didn’t need to hang onto them. If 2016 really has been as terrible as the memes would have it, then all of these awful things should remain fresh, should remain salt to pour in wounds. And yet our brains are built to dump this stuff — or to numb us if everything simply becomes too much. Isn’t the most powerful thing any of us can do, then, to remember the horrors that happen, to not forget, to not grow numb? But that’s not how our brains are built to function. At a certain point, they tap out. Not so with a Host. The more interesting Westworld becomes, the more frustrating Westworld becomes Dolores seems to exist in about 15 different timelines, and that’s only a mild exaggeration. HBO I should state here that I’ve never had a relationship with a TV show quite like the one I have with Westworld . Every week, I watch it and simultaneously love and hate the show a little bit more. Indeed, the very things that I find fascinating about it are the same things that frustrate me about it in the very next scene. As Peter Suderman wrote for Vox, Westworld is seemingly uninterested in answering even the most basic questions about how its universe operates. It, simultaneously, puts the audience in the role of a Guest — invited to play a giant game but given very few of the rules necessary to enter the game world — and a Host, with limited knowledge about the environment, period. That vagueness can be endlessly enervating when the show is, say, playing cutesy with the true identity of the Man in Black, or the number of timelines the story is operating on, when answers to both seem pretty obvious by now. At the end of “Clavier,” I think I have a fairly full theory of just what’s going on in the show (which I’ll share at the very end for the spoiler averse) — but it increasingly feels pointless to even speculate about this. Most TV shows — heck, most stories — operate with a fairly straightforward dynamic: A character wants something or wants to do something. Don Draper wants to make a great ad pitch. Tony Soprano wants to stop his panic attacks. Michael Bluth wants simultaneously to put his family back together and to escape said family. Even a more experimental narrative will usually start from the place of a character with a recognizable goal — then subvert our expectations from that point. On Westworld , however, some of the characters have concrete goals — Maeve wants to escape Westworld, for instance — but because many of the characters are unaware of fairly basic facts about their existence, it’s hard to get too invested in, say, Teddy finding Dolores and saving her. Instead, the characters with goals are those of us in the audience , who want to know what’s going on, and the writers, who are working as hard as they can to keep all of this from us. Westworld , thus, is mostly a meta-narrative — a story about how we construct stories — at this point. I have trouble imagining the show keeping this up for much longer. Indeed, the Dolores story, which was easily the most compelling in the first half of the season, has mostly become buried beneath the obfuscation about what’s happening during which timeline. There are probably versions of next week’s finale that finally drive me to drop the show — and versions that make me stand up and applaud its storytelling audacity. More likely than not, I’ll end up somewhere in the middle. Westworld is a mystery show, like Twin Peaks or Lost , but where both of those shows had most of the mysteries swirling around the characters, Westworld keeps developing mysteries within its characters. Where, say, Mad Men would keep vital parts of Don Draper’s back-story from the audience, he still knew them. He was still driven by them. But a character like Dolores is a mystery even to herself, an endless series of locked doors inside her own brain that she’s never quite sure how to open. And while that’s fun as a writing exercise, I don’t know how long it can be kept up. Take, for instance, the character of Bernard, who has been revealed in three consecutive weeks to be a Host (episode seven), someone who’s been rewritten many times (episode eight), and a figure built in the image of Arnold who has now “killed himself” so Ford can presumably rebuild him at some point (episode nine). Because this is so much story piled on top of one character, nearly all of it plays out in exposition, rather than via something with emotional followthrough. It feels, for all the world, like the storytelling equivalent of computer programming — you see the code where the emotional attachment goes, but not the emotional attachment itself. That’s maddening, but also incredibly fascinating. Hence, I love it, and I hate it. “Clavier,” at least, is probably the “best” version of this approach yet. By digging deep into Bernard’s consciousness, then balancing that with quick check-ins with essentially every other storyline in the show (including yet another “a park technician is attacked under mysterious circumstances” cliffhanger that is abandoned midway through the episode), the show reaches some sort of platonic ideal of itself. But Lord — or maybe, I should say, “Ford” — I wouldn’t mind a little clarity at this point. What I’m pretty sure is going on: possible spoilers follow after the picture Only Ford knows if I’m right, and he ain’t telling. HBO The constant flashbacks to the massacre in the little town where the Hosts were trained have made me pretty sure that not only is Dolores behind that massacre — the incident from the past that was mentioned in one of the first episodes — but that she appropriated Teddy to help her carry it out and that it’s led to Ford appropriating her as “Wyatt” in the “present” timeline (if anything on this show can be called “present”). Thus, in this theory, there are four timelines: Dolores’s life before the massacre (which we see mostly in flashbacks to her conversations with Arnold); her time with William (who is almost certainly the young Man in Black); the long torpor of her existence post-William (which seems a kind of punishment visited upon her by Ford); and the Man in Black and Teddy’s journey to find Wyatt, whom I believe to also be Dolores. Anyway, some of this is probably wrong, but it’s what I’ve got. I’ll be pretty surprised if at least some of it isn’t the case. Was this article helpful?",

    "text": "'Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life' Fails To Live Up To Its Own Potential November 28, 2016 at 10:17AM By Eleanor Tremeer @eleanortremeer Posted by Eleanor Tremeer @eleanortremeer MP staff writer. I talk about superheroes a lot. Sometimes I'm paid for it. \nLike many women my age, I spent a happy portion of my teenagehood immersed in the fantasy world of Gilmore Girls , a reality in which life's troubles were punctuated by quickfire witticisms and copious amounts of coffee. When the revival, A Year In The Life, was announced, I quickly started rewatching the entire show, happy to learn that it was almost better than I remembered. And the reunion was sure to be better than that. \nBoy, was I wrong. \nThis weekend I forced seven of my friends to sit through the six hours of Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life. The marathon claimed several bottles of wine, seemingly gallons of coffee, and our sanities, probably. The first episode started out strong, and we all teared up at the flashback-style intro, but as \"Winter\" turned to \"Spring\" it soon became apparent that this attempt at a nostalgic, fan-satisfying event was one giant mess. And here's why. What Is Chronology? \nDespite the fact that the original series and the revival revolves around the idea of the seasons passing, A Year In The Life had no coherency when it came to actual chronology. \nLet's start with what we missed, or rather, what we didn't. The revival is set roughly nine years after the end of #GilmoreGirls , and yet it is oh-so easy to jump back into the story. Nothing has changed. Lorelai's still running the same old inn (without even thinking of expanding until the end of Episode 4, when this decision should have been the driving force of the entire show), Luke's still running the diner, Rory is running back and forth from London to Stars Hollow, for no apparent reason other than her ongoing affair. The opening scenes were, admittedly, pretty good. [Credit: Netflix] \nThe only major life event in the missing nine years was Richard Gilmore's death . No-one got sick. No-one did anything radical with their lives. We didn't wonder, or even care, what we didn't see onscreen — and that's a huge writing mistake. But hey, maybe nothing happened in almost ten years because these people are just really really boring. \nThen there's the continuity errors. Emily invites Lorelai to therapy at the end of \"Winter\", when everyone's still bundled up against the cold. At the beginning of \"Spring\", we find Emily and Lorelai in their first session, in cool dresses. Nothing is made of the fact that it took them months to get to the appointment. Similarly, Lorelai announces at the end of \"Summer\" that she's \"doing Wild \" — months later, at the start of \"Fall\", she tells Luke in a phone call that she's only been alone 12 hours. What?! \nOh, and let's just quickly marvel at the scene in which Rory, at midday on the East Coast, called Logan in London, where it was inexplicably 2am. There is a five hour time difference between these places. That's not difficult to Google. Lorelai and Emily take several months to go to therapy. [Credit: Netflix] \nThis is nothing more than lazy writing and a lack of script editing and honestly, it's not the worst thing in the world. But oh, there's more. The Town That Time Forgot \nI used to love Stars Hollow. It was this quirky, beautiful place, filled with strange but ultimately kind people. Somehow, in the nine years since the first show, this town became oppressive and arrogant, so bloated with privilege and upper middle class wealth that it isn't just out of touch, the very ground it rests on seems to have had a fundamental disagreement about the laws of gravity with the rest of the Earth, taking Stars Hollow floating off into a different reality in which fat-shaming by the pool is cute and funny and there's only one gay in the village . \n(Seriously, what with that town meeting? Maybe the reason there aren't any LGBT people in your town is because you keep referring to them as \"the gays\" and will force them to march in a Pride parade, regardless of what they actually want.) \"Would the gays please stand up?\" - Taylor, probably. [Credi: Netflix] \nSitting by the pool, glorifying colonialism with their faux child slaves (where are the parents of these children?) Lorelai and Rory casually make fun of overweight people — pausing only briefly to ridicule a woman for daring to wear a bikini. We're left wondering when the Gilmore girls became mean girls. Wasn't this show feminist, once upon a time? Now, Rory's having one night stands with Wookie cosplayers because apparently this is 2007 and women have no place in nerd culture. \nThere was no actual reflection on real current events. No conflict derived from an influx of a new, diverse population to Stars Hollow. Lorelai might have watched that overlong musical in horror, but we weren't surprised. This play (a joke which overstayed its welcome by at least ten minutes) was the logical product of a town that has intentionally isolated itself — and we wore Lorelai's exact expression the entire way through A Year In The Life . Lorelai is all of us in this moment. [Credit: Netflix] \nSame Lorelai, same. No Tale To Tell \nBut we could forgive all of this. We could chock the bad continuity up to a hiccup in production, explain away Stars Hollow's bigotry by arguing A Year In The Life is a scathing commentary on Suburbia. And yet, there is one giant flaw in the revival that we can't ignore: There's no story. \nThe entire six hours of the revival revolves is a meandering wander through two lives with no purpose. Rory is terrible at her chosen career, and has no articles to pitch to major publications despite the fact that she studied Journalism at Yale. Lorelai has a successful inn and a supportive boyfriend, and yet for some reason that isn't actually resolved, is unhappy in her life. No it's fine, don't bother to ask your boyfriend before taking his trust money. [Credit: Netflix] \nThe charm and the humor of the original show is almost completely absent. We aren't invited to root for the eponymous Gilmore girls because they just keep getting upset over nothing. Aside from Michel, who is a delight, Emily is by far the strongest part of the revival — her journey from grief to finally finding her own identity outside of the ridiculous DAR world is fantastic. \nIt's just a shame we didn't get to see most of it. The sweet, poignantly ironic story of how Emily found her herself after she started living with her maid's family, is completely hidden behind unnecessary scenes of Rory's affair, and Lorelai making outdated pop culture references. \nThat DAR scene was fantastic, though. I never knew anyone could eat a biscuit so scathingly. #lifegoals Emily Gilmore was a gift. [Credit: Netflix] \nSo, was this worth waiting nine years for? Not really. Was it the worst that it could have been? Of course not, but it wasn't the best. A Year In The Life could have really shaken things up, shown us a Lorelai who had truly grown as a person, a Rory who was an amazing journalist but couldn't land a full time career because of a cruel job market. We could have had a plot revolving around a major life change or a family illness, or the mystery of what really happened in the intervening years. \nInstead, the Gilmore girls bicker about nothing as interesting plot opportunities — the inn expansion, the therapy sessions, Lorelai starting a family again — fly by like so many forgettable Marvel superheroes. \nAt least Kirk was funny. Poll What did you think of 'Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life'? What Emily said to the DAR girls? That. Eh, it was okay. Not terrible, not amazing. I loved it: The nostalgia, the reunions, the snow!

Corey Feldman and his girlfriend of four years Courtney Anne tied the knot in Las Vegas on Tuesday\nThe couple, who feared President-elect Donald Trump's new stance on immigration could separate them, announced the news on toofab . \nSpeaking to the website, Corey described himself as a'very excited and happy' man after marrying his Canadian partner. \nThe Lost Boys star and his new wife had joint bachelor and bachelorette parties at Vegas' Chateau Nightclub over the weekend. \nHe hinted at the nuptials on on Twitter earlier on in the day, writing: 'Happy 222 Day I Hav a feeling 2DAY is gonna B super special [sic]!' \nNot wasting any time: The Goonies star, 45, and the model, 27, said 'I do' at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, following their engagement in Palm Springs, California, earlier this month \nEarlier on this month the actor and musician proposed to Courtney Anne - citing fears his girlfriend will be deported as the reason why. \nAs they celebrated their fourth anniversary in Palm Springs, the actor - who admitted he was so nervous about popping the question - popped the question with a simple note instead. \n\nHe said: 'I was of course a bit nervous, as any man will admit, you never truly know what a woman is thinking. So as much as I assumed she would be happy and say \"yes,\" there's always that insecure part of my brain that regresses immediately to my childhood and thought maybe not.' \n'So I kinda chickened out and did a written proposal by writing a note with two check boxes, one for yes and the other for no.' \nLegally binding: The couple, who feared President-elect Donald Trump's new stance on immigration could separate them, announced the news on toofab\nHowever, it looks like it was all good news: 'Of course there was a ring in there with the note. Luckily she said \"yes!\" ' \nThe Goonies star admitted the modelwas very surprised by his proposal as they had previously both been 'anti-marriage'. \nHowever, he felt it was important to legalize their relationship following the election of Donald Trump , who has vowed to tighten up immigration when he takes the presidential office in January. \nCorey told People magazine: 'She was very surprised, excited and started crying. She was surprised because we had both been so anti-marriage since we met. \n'But seeing as she's Canadian and with Trump coming in, we didn't want to risk being separated by new immigration laws.' \nShe's staying put: Earlier on this month the actor and musician proposed to Courtney Anne - citing fears his girlfriend will be deported as the reason why\n'We both know that we make a good team, and don't want to be separated for any reason. So this is the best decision to protect our relationship.' \nAnd the Stand By Me actor - who has 12-year-old son Zen with ex-wife Susie Sprague - will be tying the knot sooner rather than later. \nHe said: 'We are planning a small, secret wedding just for family, very soon. \n'We will likely have a big public wedding for friends and media to attend within a year.' \nBut one thing the couple won't be rushing into is having children together. \nOld times: The Goonies star (pictured second from left in The Goonies) admitted the model was very surprised by his proposal as they had previously both been 'anti-marriage'\nHe said: 'I have always said I wanna make sure I get it right the first time, and [that] Zen comes out perfectly, well balanced, before I even think about taking on any more responsibility. \n'Courtney is young and she has a career in modeling and music, she would rather keep her body in good shape for now. She's getting good practice with Zen.' \nMeanwhile, the child actor recently performed on the Today Show , which received mixed reviews. \nAccording to People , the actor took to Facebook Live to defend himself, chatting with Courtney Anne, one of the Angels in his band, and now fiancé, though he later deleted the video. \n'We just wanted to tell everybody that, like, it’s been really painful. We put ourselves out there and we did the best that we could. And, like, I’ve never had such mean things said about me.

    "text": "Pope Francis tells US Catholics to vote their conscience \nVATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is allowing all priests to absolve women of the “grave sin” of abortion, extending indefinitely special permission he had granted for the duration of the just-ended Holy Year of Mercy. \nFrancis wrote in the Apostolic Letter made public by the Vatican on Monday that “there is no sin that God’s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled” with God. \nBut he also wrote: “I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life.” \nBecause the Roman Catholic Church holds abortion to be such a serious sin, it had long put the matter of granting forgiveness for it in the hands of a bishop, who could either hear the woman’s confession himself or delegate that to a priest who was expert in such situations. \nBut in 2015, Francis had said he was allowing all rank-and-file priests to grant absolution for an abortion for the duration of the Holy Year, which ran from Dec. 8, 2015, through Nov. 20, 2016. \nBy now letting all priests absolve the sin of abortion on a permanent basis following the end of the Holy Year, Francis is further applying his vision of a merciful church to those women who, as he has written in the past, felt they had no choice but to make “this agonizing and painful decision.” \n“May every priest, therefore, be a guide, support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation” for faithful who had abortions, Francis wrote. \nHe explained his rationale thusly: “Lest any obstacle arise between the request for reconciliation and God’s forgiveness, I henceforth grant to all priests, in virtue of their ministry, the faculty to absolve those who have committed the sin of procured abortion. \n“The provision I had made in this regard, limited to the duration of the Extraordinary Holy Year, is hereby extended, notwithstanding anything to the contrary.” \nAbortion figured in how bishops in the United States advised their flock during the recently ended US presidential election campaign. \nSome pastors urged their congregations to keep the “sacredness of life” in mind when deciding which candidate would get their vote. The phrase is widely seen as referring to abortion. President-elect Donald Trump voiced his opposition to abortion while campaigning, while his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, supported women’s right to have an abortion. Share this: ",

(Reuters) UK report whitewashes Muslim Brotherhood: Egypt parliament A 10-page report issued by the Egyptian parliament's foreign affairs committee on Sunday launched a scathing attack on EU and UK politicians and MPs who defend \"political Islam.\"\nThe report, issued in response to a UK House of Commons' foreign affairs committee's report on the Muslim Brotherhood and political Islam on 7 November, said it does not aim to defend the Egyptian government's security and legal measures against the Brotherhood group and its affiliated militant and terrorist organizations. \n\"Our report reflects our responsibility as elected MPs to stand against a group which seized its one year in power to turn Egypt into a religious state and show the world the true meaning of \"political Islam,\" said the report. \nIt added that the \"Muslim Brotherhood tried to steal history and turn the Arab world's first civilian state into a theocratic state that is hostile to human civilization and the values of freedom, equality and citizenship.\" \nThe report said \"if Europe and the West are really keen to stem the tide of religious terrorism and the political hijacking of Islam, they should correct their understanding of all political Islam movements which claim they have a licence from God to implement his laws on earth and impose the state of the caliphate on the world .\" \nAhmed Said, head of the Egyptian foreign affairs committee, told reporters Sunday that Egypt's parliament deplores the UK report's inclusion of a number of horrible lies. \n\"Our committee's report aims to expose these lies. We intend to send it to the Egyptian ambassadors in England and Germany to stand against the attempts of several politicians and MPs in these two countries to polish the image of political Islam ,\" the report said. \nSaid said \"we know from history that Europe was able to move ahead and achieve progress only after it made a separation between religion and politics.\" \n\"So we are surprised by the new generation of European radical liberals and progressives who defend political Islam and thereby give cover for Islamist movements which claim victimhood to spread across Europe and create a fertile ground for Islamist radicals there,\" said Said. \nThe report said the UK parliament's report offered a very artificial interpretation of \"political Islam.\" \n\"We wonder how a parliament that was based on separating religion from politics approves that a country like Egypt be governed by a theocratic state,\" said the report, adding that \"this is a setback from all the democratic and liberal ideals which formed the foundation of European civilization.\" \nThe report said that \"the UK parliament made a very artificial and marginal differentiation between Islamist movements that exploit democracy to reach power on the one hand, and Islamist movements that seek the path of violence and armed jihad to impose their radical ideology on societies, on the other.\" \n\"All studies that have been conducted on political Islam movements show that there are no essential differences among them and that they all seek one objective – that is trying to impose a strict code of Islam and Islamic Sharia law on the world, and to launch an armed Jihad against 'infidel rulers' everywhere,\" argued the report. \n\"In other words,\" the report added, \"these groups want to Islamise the entire world and they only differ on when and how these objectives should be implemented,\" said the report. \n\"While a group like the Muslim Brotherhood shows the face of artificial Islamic moderation to gain ground in the West and infiltrate societies there, other groups seek the road of violence. Each complements the other,\" said the report. \nThe report described the Muslim Brotherhood \"as the mother of all jihadist and Salafist movements.\" \n\"The UK parliament report ignores – either on purpose or due to a lack of knowledge about historical facts – that since it was established in the first third of the previous century the Muslim Brotherhood has been responsible for spreading the radical Islamic ideology upon which all terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida, ISIS, Hamas, Ezzeddin Al-Qassam, Al-Nusra Front and Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis were based,\" said the report, adding that \"most of the leaders of these terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaida's current leader Ayman Al-Zawahri were once members of Muslim Brotherhood.\" \n\"This group is the godfather of all jihadist and Salafist ideologies which dream of resurrecting the state of the caliphate against the infidel West,\" said the report. \n\"We doubt that UK politicians or MPs have any books about the ideological basis of this group, which is highly hostile to the West and what they describe as its \"liberal and infidel culture,\" said the report. \nTo press its case, the report reviews a number of political assassinations which the Muslim Brotherhood has carried out since it was established by its leader Hassan Al-Banna in 1928. \nThe second part of the response accuses the UK report of making \"a big mistake\" by drawing a comparison between the experience of Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Tunisia. \n\"The Media and politicians in the West always like to portray Tunisia as the democratic, inclusive model in the Middle East,\" said the report, adding that \"this is a big mistake because facts show that Tunisia has become a fertile ground for Islamist jihadists who spread extremism and terrorism in France and Europe and that more than 1,000 Tunisians — the greatest number from any Arab country — a have joined the IS group.\" \n\"Doesn't this show that the Muslim Brotherhood ideology was behind the transformation of Tunisia into a breeding ground for jihadists,\" wondered the report, adding that \"not to mention that Tunisia is a small country – with 11 million people – but Egypt is a country with 90 million and the birthplace of the Muslim Brotherhood, which exploited political tolerance over eight decades to create a wide network of businesses and secret armed militias.\" \n\"The Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt owns banks, charity organizations and receives huge donations from wealthy sympathisers in the Arabian Gulf and throughout the Islamic world,\" said the report. \nThe report also argued that the Muslim Brotherhood in Tunisia accepted democracy only for tactical reasons. \"After they saw how millions in Egypt revolted against their mother group, they decided to backtrack only for tactical reasons,\" said the report. \nThe report's third section is devoted to explaining the Muslim Brotherhood's ideology and internal structure \"which is highly hostile to all democratic values.\" \n\"Their ideology is based on strict obedience to the group's supreme guide, not to mention that its main ideologues, such as Sayyid Qutb, were the ones who invented the jihadist ideology which states that \"democracy goes against the rule of God and Islamic Sharia,\" said the report. \nThe report also reviews in detail \"the one year of the Muslim Brotherhood in power in Egypt.\" \n\"They exploited the collapse of (former president) Hosni Mubarak's ruling party to exclude all civilian political forces from power and impose their rule on the country. When millions revolted against them and expelled them from power on 30 June, 2013, they resorted to claims of victimhood again, only to find an ear in the UK and its parliament,\" said the report, insisting that \"Egyptians stand firm against the rule of 'the supreme guide' and will not allow their country to become a religious state.\" \n\"Egyptians are in a battle of life and death against this group, which is the mother of all radical Islam movements,\" said the report. \nThe report also said that many of those who implemented terrorist attacks against the US on 11 September, 2001 received training at the hands of old and veteran Muslim Brotherhood leaders. \nThe report spotlights what it calls the Muslim Brotherhood's \"empowerment ideology\" which seeks to Islamise the entire world in a gradual way. \nThe report urges the UK parliament and politicians to review \"the dark history of the Muslim Brotherhood\" and to verify their information about it \"instead of issuing distorted reports about political Islam.\" \n\"While the world has become increasingly aware of the dangers of all radical Islam movements, we are surprised that the UK MPs and politicians still live in a coma, insistent not only on polishing the image of these movements, but also propagating the biggest lie: that it is a peaceful and moderate movement,\" the report concludes. \nThe report includes a great number of details about the yearlong rule of former president Mohamed Morsi and how the Brotherhood exploited this year to isolate all political forces. \n\"For all those who believe in the West that Islamist movements can be integrated into the political process of Arab countries, we offer this bitter experience to put an end to this lie,\" said the report. \nThe UK House of Commons' foreign affairs committee released its report on 7 November, commenting on the findings and conclusions of a December 2015 review by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) on the Muslim Brotherhood. The 2015 FCO report concluded that the group has long maintained a dubious position vis-à-vis the use of violence and terrorism to achieve political change. The UK parliament committee said that the FCO review “undermined confidence in the impartiality of the FCO’s work” due to the “misguided appointment” of Sir John Jenkins, the UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia, to head the review effort. \n",

    "text": "The Scary Truth About Corporate Survival View more from the Loading... Patrick George \nIt’s one of those stats that’s constantly thrown around at conferences: 80% of the companies that existed before 1980 are no longer around—and another 17% probably won’t be here in five years. Dartmouth professor Vijay Govindarajan heard versions of this so often that he eventually began using it himself—even though he didn’t know whether it was accurate or, if it was, why it was true. So he and his colleague Anup Srivastava decided to take a rigorous look at corporate longevity. \nPrior researchers had examined survival rates of the Fortune 500 and the S&P 500 firms, but the Dartmouth professors cast a wider net, including all 29,688 companies that listed on U.S. stock markets from 1960 to 2009. (They reasoned that the Fortune 500 and the S&P 500 represent only very large companies, which may be especially vulnerable to disruption.) They divided the companies into 10-year cohorts according to when they listed and examined how many in each cohort were still in business five years later. This confirmed that longevity is decreasing: Companies that listed before 1970 had a 92% chance of surviving the next five years, whereas companies that listed from 2000 to 2009 had only a 63% chance, even when the researchers controlled for the dot-com bust and the Great Recession. \nResearchers from the Boston Consulting Group had done a similar analysis in 2015, but Govindarajan says the new findings are subtly different. Although both studies found that corporate mortality rates are rising, the Dartmouth researchers isolated what kinds of companies are fueling the rise. “This trend isn’t because of an increasing likelihood that a firm listed before 1970 will fail—it’s mainly because recently listed firms are dying more quickly,” Govindarajan says. The new research also attempts to answer the more important questions raised by the finding: Why are these businesses failing, and how can managers prevent it? “Now the Barrier to Entry Is User Attention” \nVibhu Mittal has experienced the challenge of creating competitive advantage from two distinct vantage points. During nine years as a senior scientist at Google, he helped a dominant technology company strengthen its position; and in the past seven years, while leading a series of education technology start-ups (he’s currently the CEO of Edmodo), he worked to disrupt incumbents. He spoke with HBR about Silicon Valley’s evolving view of creative destruction. Edited excerpts follow. \nHas it become more difficult to create competitive advantage? Absolutely. The analogy I make is to open-source software. Companies used to do proprietary stuff, and they tended to innovate slowly. Today companies are willing to talk about their innovations more openly and to post code and have thousands of people look at it so that they can modify it, test it, and get more reactions. The rate of feedback from open sourcing is an order of magnitude greater, but you also get more imitation. The barriers to entry haven’t entirely disappeared—but they’ve been moved a bit further along, beyond the product innovation stage. Now the barrier to entry is whether you can get user attention. \nIs it easier to build moats around physical products? That’s a valid point, but as 3-D printing becomes more common, you’re going to see more companies displacing products in the physical space, too. If you outsource manufacturing to China, 3-D printing can shift the turnaround time to weeks rather than months. \nAmong digital start-ups, how much fear is there of copycat products? You often see a copycat make a slightly better version of a product, and a lot of people migrate from older versions. Companies can’t afford to rest on their laurels anymore—you have to behave in a paranoid fashion. If you don’t see a threat on the horizon, it’s probably because you’re missing something. One of the biggest reasons for creative destruction today is that the world has become far more interconnected—everybody can talk to anybody, and that has implications. People will copy any successful idea out there. \nTo that end, the researchers dug into financial statements, closely analyzing how the companies that went public in different decades varied in their spending on physical assets (such as plants and equipment) and on organizational capital (things including personnel, patents, R&D, and intellectual property). They found that on average, firms listed after 2000 spent more than twice as much as earlier firms (in percentage terms) on organizational capital and half as much on physical assets. “The newer firms are grounded in novel business models, like digital services, that can be launched and distributed quickly,” they write. “This gives them an advantage over production firms, [because] ‘idea’ companies don’t require an expensive infrastructure of factories, warehouses, and suppliers.” But that advantage is a double-edged sword, they add: “The good news is the newer firms are more nimble. The bad news for these firms is that their days are numbered, unless they continually innovate.” \nThat pessimistic view is driven by a simple fact: Compared with companies that own factories, products, and supply chains, digital companies are far more vulnerable to quick imitation. Govindarajan rattles off examples. Not so long ago, everyone was suddenly using Evernote, the organization app. Now Microsoft OneNote, Apple’s Notes, Google Keep, Simplenote, and other apps offer similar functionality. Skype, FaceTime, Viber, Jitsi, and Google Hangouts all battle in the video chat area. Then there’s Dropbox, the pioneering user-friendly cloud storage company—whose basic functionality was quickly mimicked by Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Google. “Creative destruction has always been a force to be reckoned with, but in the physical world, the cycles were longer,” Govindarajan says. “In the technology-based sectors, the cycles have accelerated.” \nSome of the implications of the shift from physical assets to digital business models are subtle and unexpected. For instance, Govindarajan points to the need to revamp standard business school accounting courses, which tend to belabor inventory models (remember LIFO and FIFO?), the cost of goods sold, depreciation, and other concepts that made sense when balance sheets were laden with physical assets but are less relevant when many companies’ products are downloadable bits and bytes. Govindarajan says that’s just one example of how business schools’ curricula don’t adequately reflect the current economic environment. \nThe study also addresses the most important question raised by the primary finding: How can newer firms buck the trend and increase their longevity? The researchers suggest three strategies. First, companies could incorporate both technology and physical products into their business models to gain an edge; their competitors couldn’t then simply hire programmers to quickly create me-too services. (Examples of digital-physical hybrids include Tesla, which has developed deep expertise in batteries and vehicle manufacturing, and Amazon, whose vast network of warehouses provides a bulwark against competition.) \nSecond, companies could strive for business models that include strong network effects. For instance, Facebook’s one billion users create a competitive advantage, because people who might be tempted to jump to a rival platform would have to reconnect to friends and recreate the content they’ve uploaded—a steep switching cost. Third, firms could increase their focus on continual innovation—an idea Govindarajan has illustrated in a framework he calls “the three-box model” (which is the subject of a 2011 HBR article and a 2016 book). \nThe results also led Govindarajan to reflect on the common criticism that CEOs tend to think too much about the short term. “People blame Wall Street for this pressure, but in fact Wall Street demands that you look for a healthy balance between the short term and the long term,” he says. “Otherwise you’re not going to be there after the short term.” About the Research: “Strategy When Creative Destruction Accelerates,” by Vijay Govindarajan and Anup Srivastava (working paper) A version of this article appeared in the December 2016 issue (pp.24–25) of Harvard Business Review .

    "text": "  World In extraordinary overreach, Trump team says he will not seek criminal charges on Clinton U.S. protocol holds that the attorney general and the FBI should conduct investigations and file charges free of interference from the president. President-elect Donald Trump and vice-president-elect Mike Pence arrive at the clubhouse of the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., Nov. 19, 2016. In an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday, Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to his transition, said the Trump wanted to \"move beyond the issues of the campaign\" and confirmed that he did not want his promised Clinton investigations to take place. ( HILARY SWIFT / NYT ) By Jerry Markon, Paul Farhi and Karen Tumulty The Washington Post   WASHINGTON—President-elect Donald Trump has decided that his administration will not pursue criminal investigations related to former rival Hillary Clinton’s private email server or her family foundation, his campaign manager said Tuesday. Trump’s apparent decision, conveyed by campaign manager Kellyanne Conway in an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe , would be an extraordinary break with political and legal protocol, which holds that the attorney general and FBI make decisions on whether to conduct investigations and file charges, free of pressure from the president. During his campaign, Trump had issued incendiary calls for a special prosecutor to reopen the FBI’s closed investigation of Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of state and had also urged investigations of allegations of corruption at the Clinton Foundation. He nicknamed the Democratic nominee “Crooked Hillary” and encouraged chants of “Lock her up!” at his rallies. But Conway said Trump now sees things differently. “I think when the president-elect, who’s also the head of your party, tells you before he’s even inaugurated that he doesn’t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message, tone and content” to fellow Republicans, she said. “Look, I think he’s thinking of many different things as he prepares to become the President of the United States, and things that sound like the campaign are not among them,” she added. Trump has not spoken directly about his apparent change of heart but hinted at it in a post-election interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes .   “I’m going to think about it,” he said. “I don’t want to hurt them, I don’t want to hurt them. They’re, they’re good people.” Trump’s conciliatory gesture stood in contrast to his continued fights on Twitter. The president-elect escalated his long-standing battle with the media on Tuesday, cancelling a meeting at The New York Times and blasting the publication on Twitter hours after he criticized TV journalists at another contentious sit-down. Trump had scheduled two meetings with the publisher and journalists from the Times on Tuesday, including one on-the-record session. But the president-elect, who frequently attacked the paper during his campaign, suddenly cancelled the events in a series of tweets. “I cancelled today’s meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice,” Trump wrote to his nearly 16 million followers on the microblogging site. “Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes,” he continued. “In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone!” Times editors and reporters also took to Twitter to deny Trump’s account. Clifford Levy, the paper’s assistant masthead editor, tweeted out an official response saying it was the president-elect who had tried to change the ground rules by seeking only a private meeting. “We did not change the ground rules at all and made no attempt to,” Levy wrote. “We were unaware that the meeting was cancelled until we saw the President Elect’s tweet this morning.” Times columnist Nicholas Kristof went further, tweeting: “Mr. President-Elect, no reason to be scared of Times journalists!” The extraordinary spectacle of a man about to become president and one of its leading newspapers engaging in a Twitter war underscores how Trump’s always contentious relations with the media have deteriorated even further since his election. The relationship between presidents and those who cover them is often an adversarial one, but media experts say Trump’s blasts against reporters — he called them the “lowest form of humanity” during the campaign — have broken new ground. His Twitter spat with the Times came one day after Trump did sit down with television news executives and some well-known TV journalists — and repeatedly told them the campaign reporting about him was “unfair” and “dishonest.” Participants in the meeting at Trump Tower in New York described it as a contentious but generally respectful gathering. But if the media elite attended in hopes of improving relations with the forthcoming Trump administration, that wasn’t quite in the cards. The president-elect specifically called out reporting by CNN and NBC that he deemed unfair, according to four people who attended the meeting, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting was off the record. Instead of striking a harmonious tone to build rapport following the election, Trump was combative, participants said. In a calm and deliberate voice, he told the group sitting around a conference table that they had failed to provide their viewers with fair and accurate coverage, and told them they failed to understand him or his appeal to millions of Americans. But he made no mention of the enormous amount of airtime that the networks, especially on cable, devoted to his campaign. A number of analyses have noted that Trump’s presidential effort was boosted by the news media’s fascination with him. In a sign of another battle with the media to come, Trump also shrugged off the need for a constant press pool covering him, the people said, though he did not delve into specifics. Trump has repeatedly shirked his pool, upending a long-standing tradition of the president and president-elect. A protective pool, as it is known, is considered necessary for disclosure of what the president is doing and transparency when big news breaks. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, for example, drew criticism when she left a September 11 memorial ceremony after falling ill without alerting pool reporters. On the policy front, Trump released a video late Monday in which he said his transition to power, which has at times been chaotic, “is working very smoothly, efficiently and effectively.” He outlined a series of executive actions in the video that he said he intends to take on his first day in office: issuing notification of intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement; cancelling restrictions on energy production; putting in place a rule that two regulations must be eliminated for every new one enacted; ordering a plan to protect U.S. infrastructure from cyberattacks and other forms of attack; directing the Labor Department to investigate “abuses of visa programs that undercut the American worker”; and imposing a five-year ban on executive officials becoming lobbyists. Notably missing from the actions were some of his most prominent campaign promises, such as building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to keep out illegal immigrants and developing an early plan to confront the Islamic State terror group. Though President-elect Donald Trump’s first five picks for top jobs in his administration have all been white men, transition officials insisted Monday that the team he ultimately puts together will represent a cross-section of America. Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters on a conference call that the president-elect met with a “high-caliber and broad and diverse group” of job seekers and advisers in recent days and predicted that the top rungs of the executive branch that Trump assembles in the coming weeks “will be very broad and diverse, both with the Cabinet and the administration.” That point was echoed by Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who said that assuring diversity — both in backgrounds and political philosophy — is a priority for Trump. “And diversity means meeting with people across the aisle who are traditionally more Democratic, who are coming together and wanting to offer him advice, perhaps vie for a spot in his Cabinet,” Conway said. “But willing to give him counsel and willing to share experiences and have candid conversations about their views and their backgrounds.” The Trump aides were seeking to dismiss speculation that the parade of people summoned by the president-elect — which has included women, non-whites and erstwhile political foes — has been merely for show. That skepticism comes in the aftermath of a brutal presidential campaign that was punctuated by frequent incidents in which Trump said and did things that offended women, Latinos and Muslims, while drawing support from white nationalist groups. Exit polls suggest that Trump owes his victory to white voters, of whom 58 per cent supported him. By comparison, he won only 8 per cent of African American voters, and 29 per cent each of Hispanics and Asian Americans, the exit polls showed. Read more about:",

Davis, three officers in uniform but in an unmarked vehicle were on patrol in the area when they encountered a man on foot around 12:30 p.m. and stopped to speak with him. \nDuring the conversation, the man made a sudden movement toward his waistband, and the officers engaged in a struggle with the man. During the struggle, the officers heard a gunshot and an officer fired his weapon, according to Davis. \nThe number of shots fired by the officer was unclear, Davis said. \nDavis said she does not know what specifically prompted the officers to approach the man, but said they were conducting a neighborhood canvas because statistics have shown a 20% uptick in violent crime and robberies in the area. \n\"Much of what he have attempted to do is gather intelligence in the community from the community members,\" Davis said. \nAccording to Davis, a gun not belonging to the Durham Police Department was found at the scene. \nPolice did not identify the man killed, pending the notification of relatives, or the officers involved. An officer suffered a leg injury but was not shot, Davis said. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment. \nDavis did not know if the officers and the man had met previously, but said the three officers and community members were \"very familiar\" with one another. \nDavis said that two officers have been placed on administrative assignment and the officer who was hospitalized will be placed on administrative assignment following his release. \nClaudette Parker, who lives in the neighborhood with her children, said she is concerned by the continued violence in the community. \n\"We just need to come together,\" Parker said. \"We need to come up with a plan...so we can cut down on this violence. It's just too much. We want this community to be safe for the kids.\" \nParker said she believes better communication is the key to preventing future incidents. \n\"I believe the police need to have better communication with the community. We just need to sit down and come up with a plan,\" she said. \nCommunity activist Rafiq Zaidi was on scene Tuesday afternoon and spent time talking to residents. \n\"They are speaking the same language that I am speaking, with the same passion,\" he said. \"We're tired. It's justice or else. Enough is enough.\" \nDurham police on Monday night approved the use of body cameras for officers, but the cameras have not yet been purchased. Following Tuesday's incident, Davis said the department is looking to begin an aggressive rollout of the cameras in the district that includes the McDougald Terrace community in January. \nTuesday’s shooting is being investigated by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, which is standard procedure in an officer-involved shooting. \nDavis said she is hopeful that any civilians with footage from the scene will come forward, but there were no police dash cameras. \nWhen asked if she was concerned about community response to the shooting, Davis said she aims to maintain a level of transparency, \n\"We immediately reached out to a couple of the local ministers and also our victim witness until was responding as well so we could have dialogue and open conversation about what occurred in the community,\" she said. \nTuesday’s deadly shooting at the largest public housing community in Durham comes after a series of incidents throughout the year involving gun violence. \nIn March 2016, John Burton, 78, was at the McDougald Terrace Housing Complex working on his nephew’s car when someone driving by shot and killed him. \nIn April, several cars were shot at long Wabash Street and Ridgeway Avenue. \nIn May, a 33-year-old man was found dead with a gunshot wound while three children were playing outside. \nThe last time Durham police were involved in a deadly shooting was September 2015, when four officers shot Lavonte Biggs after they said he pointed a gun at them. The weapon was later found to be a pellet gun and the district attorney did not file criminal charges. Credits",

Who didn't want sovereignty, free health care or universal literacy? Some, however, who witnessed the summary trials and executions of enemies, real and perceived, saw the writing on the bloody wall -- the notorious paredón of the firing squads -- and fled the country. For others, it took much longer for the bigger picture of the revolution to come into focus, as it was in a constant state of flux, battling detractors, internal dissidents and the Yankee colossus to the north, unhappy that a socialist regime had taken root 100 miles off its coast. At the height of the Cold War, all countries and especially developing ones, were forced to choose one superpower straitjacket or the other. As a result, Castro figured prominently in two of the era's watersheds: the humiliating fiasco at the Bay of Pigs, followed 17 months later by the near cataclysm of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Hide Caption 10 of 10 Yet while El Comandante wanted to play with the big boys -- in fact he longed to be the biggest and baddest boy -- he was discounted when the showdown came. Kennedy and Khrushchev would decide the fate of the world without him. Read More This blow to Castro's ego was redirected into the restless struggle to find other outlets on the international stage -- in South America, Asia and Africa -- to play out the aggrandized role Castro envisioned for himself and his revolution. In those days, every year of the revolution was named for a cause: Year of Solidarity (1966), Year of the Heroic Guerrilla (1968), the Year of the 10 Million (1970), with its single-minded effort to reach an unrealistic sugar cane harvest goal that nearly bankrupted the country. And despite his failures, El Comandante still found ways to inspire his supporters at home and abroad, supporters who dedicated their lives to the revolution's idealistic vision of justice and equality for all. JUST WATCHED Fidel Castro has died aged 90 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nFidel Castro has died aged 90 01:40 The truth, unfortunately, was a far cry from this utopia. As early as 1961, Castro threw down the gauntlet in a famous speech to the island's writers and intellectuals: Within the revolution, everything. Against the revolution, nothing. This meant that dissent of any nature -- artistic, political or otherwise -- was forbidden, resulting in an ever-growing intolerance (think of the internment camps for homosexuals and other so-called social deviants in the '60s) for anything perceived as swerving from the party line. What was the party line? Whatever El Comandante decided it was -- for convenience, expedience or the increasingly baroque and self-serving rationalizations he provided for staying in power. Can a revolution that has endured more than a half-century still be called a revolution? New hope for Cuba Did Castro really believe that in an educated, once-industrious population of more than 11 million souls he was the only one qualified to run the country? (Despite his brother Raúl taking the helm in 2008, everyone knows that Castro pulled the strings behind the scenes.) For years, Castro blamed the US embargo -- a senseless policy if there ever was one -- for Cuba's economic troubles, never once accepting responsibility for the erratic and ill-conceived decisions that have run the country aground. This became painfully apparent after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, presaging the collapse of the Soviet Union and the drastic depletion of the revolution's hefty subsidies along with it. What ensued was a terrible period -- euphemistically called the Special Period -- during which many Cubans actually went hungry . In a desperate bid for foreign currency, Castro threw open the doors to tourism and its attendant problems, including glaring socioeconomic disparities that brought on rampant prostitution, black market hustling and more corruption. What Cuba deal says to Latin America (Opinion) A few years ago, when I returned to Cuba after a long absence, I kept hearing the phrase Cerraron la bolsa , meaning, roughly, that the government was bankrupt -- not just financially but morally and spiritually. The beacon that the Cuban Revolution once represented to the world had become nothing more than a grimy night light, with the Cuban people openly detesting Fidel himself -- once a sacred cow -- and his interminable gerontocracy. Los viejos no nos dejan vivir. The old men don't let us live. This is the refrain to a still-popular song on the island. I can only hope that with the passing of El Comandante, the Cuban people on both sides of the Straits of Florida -- and beyond -- can finally live fully and freely in pursuit of their dreams, and begin to heal from this failed, costly experiment.",

    "text": "Published November 24, A storm will bring a dose of chilly air, drenching rain, mountain snow and gusty winds to much of California, Arizona and Nevada this weekend.\nEnough rain, snow and wind will occur to cause travel disruptions as people head home from their Thanksgiving and shopping activities.\nFirst, pouring rain will spread southward over much of California on Saturday then push inland over the Southwest during the rest of the weekend.\nAreas from San Francisco and Sacramento to Los Angeles and San Diego will get a thorough soaking. Enough rain can fall in these cities and other areas to cause minor urban flooding and raise the risk of mudslides in recent burn areas.\nSeveral inches of rain will fall along the coast of northern California and Oregon with 1-2 inches over much of central California and 0.50 to 1 inch along the coast of Southern California.\nThe combination of rain and a low cloud ceiling can cause delays at area airports, including San Francisco and Los Angeles.\nSpotty showers may survive the trip across the deserts and may briefly visit cities such as Palm Springs, California, Las Vegas and Phoenix.\nPlaylist used for trending content.\nThe storm will bring along a considerable amount of cold air. High temperatures will trend downward from the 70s F on Friday to the 60s on Saturday and the 50s on Sunday around Los Angeles.\nSnow levels will lower over the mountains as the weekend progresses and the chilly air settles over the region.\n\"Wintry travel will affect the passes in California and over the mountains in Arizona,\" according to AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity.\nCalifornia passes at risk for slippery conditions with snowcovered roads include Donner Pass, along Interstate 80, and Tejon Pass, along I-5. Travel may also be slippery over Siskiyou Summit, along I-5 in southern Oregon and over the higher terrain along I-40 in Arizona.\n\"Snowfall will range from a few inches over the passes to 1-2 feet over the high country of the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades,\" according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Rob Miller.\nFrom 6 to perhaps as much as 12 inches can accumulate over the Arizona mountains, Miller said.\nThe snow will be an early boon for ski resorts with a full season ahead.\nGusty winds accompanying the storm will cause blowing and drifting snow over the mountains and passes and rough seas and surf for a time along the coast.\nWinds could become strong enough to be a problem for high-profile vehicles, such as trucks and RVs venturing through the passes.\nGusty winds will also kick up some dust over some of the deserts in southeastern California and southern Arizona, where little or no rain falls.\nThe rain and snow will bring some drought relief, although it will primarily bring short-term benefits.\nIn the wake of the weekend storm, cool air will remain entrenched over much of the region.\nTemperatures into the start of December will range from a few degrees below average along the southern California coast to about 10 degrees below average over the interior Southwest.\nThe pattern will help set the stage for stormy conditions over much of the nation well into December.",

This is not the best time this judgment should have come. \n“But we are still looking for Nigeria of our own, I mean Nigeria, where there will be fairness and equity. \n“It is regrettable that some charlatans can be colluding with INEC and others to destroy our party. This is very regrettable and unfortunate. \n“As it is now, the commission has no reason not to postpone this election because what the INEC did was a deliberate action to weaken our party. \n“This judgment coming at this time is a major setback for our party, which I believe can only be cured if this election is postponed,’’ he said. \n(NAN)",

This year the largest organization dedicated to developing leadership qualities in young women has taken their message of empowerment to theÂ 90th Anniversary Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with a float showcasing just what being a girl scout is all about.Â The first-ever Girl Scout float to appear in the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade features girls literally building a better world one piece at a time. \nFor its Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade debut, the Girl Scouts went big. Their float features Girl Scouts using a crane to fit giant 3-D puzzle pieces together into the shape of a globe in a visual representation of how capable girls are ofÂ making great change. Two dozen Girl Scout badges adorn the float, representing some of the activities and leadership experiences girls are exposed to through the Girl Scouts. In a symbolic gesture of how girls can â and do â drive progress in the world, girls also physically powered the float down the parade routeÂ via bicycles. [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/jeaniad/status/801805913946521600] \nThe organization hopes the float inspires all girls to join the Girl Scouts in creating positive change in their communities.Â \" What better way to champion the amazing activities our Girl Scouts do and the impact they make every day than to give their accomplishments national visibility with a float in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade,\" Andrea Bastiani Archibald,Â chief girl expert at Girl Scouts of the USA, said in a statement released by the organization.Â \n\"Girl Scouts across the nation positively make the world a better place by identifying problems in their communities and developing innovative solutions to address them,\"Â Archibald said.Â \"Our intention is that, with our appearance in the parade, all girls will be inspired to realize their potential, encouraged to embrace challenges, and motivated to make a positive change in the world.\" [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/MaddieTaeMusic/status/801813075351502853] Country music duoÂ Madison Marlow and Taylor Dye, known simply as Maddie and Tae to fans, sang their hit songÂ Fly Â from atop the first-ever Girl Scouts Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade float.Â \nThe organization also rolled out their To Get Her There Campaign Â Thursday to highlight the importance of investing in girls by investing in the Girl Scouts, which aims to help young women take the lead and embrace their innnerÂ G.I.R.L.

    "text": "By Rmuse   10:35 am \"The question for us is will Trump as president use the power he has to interfere -- given that he has a financial interest in the outcome of these matters.\" Share   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* \nA couple of days ago this column reported and commented on the conservative Wall Street Journal telling Donald Trump to liquidate his holdings, place the proceeds in a “ blind trust ,” turn over remaining assets to his children and cease communicating with them about Trump business. The Journal’s reason was because “ If Mr. Trump doesn’t liquidate, he will be accused of a pecuniary motive any time he takes a policy position.” \nThe editors at the Journal did not go on to say that one very unique reason “ he will be accused of a pecuniary motive any time he takes a policy position” is because that is precisely what a corrupt person like Trump is prone to do. Sure enough, there are reports that Trump is already planning on acting out of a “ pecuniary motive ” when he “ remakes the agency that ruled against him ” because as White House occupant he will have that authority. \nNo-one in their right mind is surprised at this latest outrage, particularly when a couple of days after the election Trump argued that the lawsuit against his phony rip-off university had to be postponed until after he was in the White House and wielded control over the Justice Department and federal judges’ jobs. Although Trump didn’t actually say that is why he wanted a postponement, there is no doubt in a sane human being’s mind that was his intent. The Judge Trump said was incapable of presiding over a fair trial because ‘he’s a Mexican’ rejected Trump’s argument. \nNow there is news that Dirty Don intends on revamping a federal agency NLRB) that ruled against him about three weeks ago for violating federal labor laws. In the interim, instead of complying with the agency’s ruling and order, Trump’s lawyers are tying up the issue in court just long enough for a new White House administration to step in and overturn the previous ruling. \nOne of the Las Vegas hotels owned by corrupt Trump is escalating what has already been a nasty war with the one federal agency charged with enforcing the nation’s labor laws and protecting the labor force. The war is over the right of workers to organize and collectively bargain; something the Koch brothers, all Republicans, and especially Donald Trump the “businessman” or potential president-elect is not going to stand idly by and allow to happen; not when the ultimate authority to crush workers’ rights and union labor is within his grasp. \nSince Trump despises labor unions nearly as much as he hates the U.S. Constitution, as a president, he will soon seek vengeance against the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and remake it in his anti-union image when he appoints new members who will make Trump’s “union problem” just go away. It is precisely what no small number of political commenters and experts predicted would happen if ‘he’ was ever allowed to seize control over federal government agencies. \nThis column commented on the smack down the NRLB issued to Trump about three weeks ago over his, and his Trump International Hotel’s, refusal to either acknowledge or accept the result of an election that Trump didn’t win. The NLRB ordered Trump to negotiate with the now-organized workers according to federal law and that is when the real problem started. Remember, as a megalomaniac authoritarian, no-one, especially not a government agency, tells Donald Trump what to do; particularly if he thinks it might cut into his profits and prevent him from taking advantage of workers. \nThe NLRB ordered Trump to negotiate with Unite Here, a coalition of the Culinary Workers union and Bartenders union, that Trump’s employees said they want to be represented by and voted accordingly. Trump refuses to recognize the union, and charged that employees were intimidated into voting Yes. The reality is that Trump hired a union-busting firm to threaten and intimidate the workers, mostly immigrants and women, into fearing for their livelihoods if they dared cross “boss Trump” and vote according to their best self-interests. \nAfter hearing the Trump hotel’s lies and complaints, all three members of the NLRB, two Democrats and one Republican, rejected Trump’s argument and ruled unanimously that Trump had no choice but to recognize and negotiate with the union according to the law; a law that will most certainly face a similar fate as the NLRB. Trump sent in his attorneys who promptly filed a federal lawsuit to change the ruling as quickly as Trump hopes to change the NLRB into a Trump-friendly federal agency; an independent government agency that will become organized labor’s worst enemy. \nThe NLRB was created to protect labor and is charged with interpreting and enforcing the nation’s labor laws, overseeing union elections, and ruling on complaints from both workers and management. \nSince the NLRB is considered an independent agency, a president in regular times cannot fire its members, but these are far from “ regular ” times. A president can appoint new members, subject to Senate confirmation, when current member’s term is finished and Trump will fill two vacancies immediately and a third in December 2017. And as president, next October he appoints a new NLRB general counsel; probably the most crucial agency position. The general counsel decides which labor dispute cases are ever brought to the agency for consideration and adjudication. Trump can easily fill the NLRB with Koch-approved anti-union people and, as Money/CNN noted , remake the NLRB in a big way and deal organized labor the true death conservatives have dreamt about for generations. \nRepublicans have ramped up their attacks on the NLRB during President Obama’s tenure because they claim the agency is better protecting workers and making it harder for employers to take advantage of the work force, and just three weeks ago imposed an unfair ruling that failed to favor employers at the expense of worker rights and federal laws. \nThe NLRB has been at the center of Republican angst for some time because it is not predatory towards the labor force and unions; something Republicans expect Donald Trump to remedy sooner rather than later. The Kochs demand it, the U.S. Chamber demands it, corporations expect it, and with unchallenged authority, anti-labor Donald Trump will see their demands reach fruition; if for no other reason than to impose some old-school vengeance on workers for voting the wrong way. \nNow that they control all facets of government, Republicans are eager to have a NLRB that is more favorable to big business and adversarial toward organized labor and workers’ rights. As they should be, unions representing Trump hotel workers are rightly worried about “ what Trump might do to interfere ” with the current case when he takes over and runs the government. That was the statement from Bethany Khan, a spokesperson for the Culinary Workers Union. She said, \n“ The question for us is: Will Donald Trump as president of the United States of America use the power he has to interfere — given that he has a financial interest in the outcome of these matters.” \nMs. Khan also said that besides Trump’s greed, what drives the workers’ concerns are whether there are any federal ethics rules allowing Trump’s puppets on the NLRB to rule on cases involving his business; exactly the kind of conflict of interest no small number of experts have warned will happen. Khan said, \n“ The Culinary Union may challenge those rulings if this situation arises. The new majority can be expected to be less generous in protection of workers’ rights than the current NLRB.” \nOne wonders what all of the nation’s law enforcement unions, most of whom endorsed Trump , are thinking about their prospects under a government, and labor protection agency, devoted to serving the interests of anyone but workers; and hungers to put an end to organized labor once and for all time. These are not unjustified concerns, either. Because with the Republican Party, Koch brothers, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Donald Trump running the entire government, unions are an endangered species and Trump’s hotel workers in Las Vegas are about to experience a greedy authoritarian’s vengeance because he didn’t win an election and hates labor as much as he hates unions.",

The person should give us the certificate of the quality of the rice, you have to prove the import duties you paid for it, where you brought it from and you give us Standard Organization of Nigeria certificate to prove that the rice is not poisonous. \nUmahi said foreign rice is poisonous as according to him, some of them were stored for more then 20 years abroad before it would be smuggled into the country. \n“That is why we have cases of cancer, cases of kidney failure and all kinds of diseases that our people were not known for. So you are taking risk if you are selling foreign rice in the land of Ebonyi,”he added. \nThe governor who said Ebonyi government had enough rice and looking for distributors, advised people to register and become distributors of Ebonyi rice. \nHe promised to open up modern markets in all the thirteen local government areas of the state and assured that the kpirikpiri market when completed would compete with any other modern market in the country. \nMeanwhile, the Special Adviser to the governor on Trade and Investment, Peter Obah have ordered all foreign rice dealers in the state to evacuate the produce from the state within two weeks . \nHe said, “Foreign rice should be evacuated or moved out of the state within two weeks . Once again, no sale, buying or consumption of foreign rice in Ebonyi state”. \n‘’This is to safeguard the lives of the people who now consume unhealthy substances packaged as foreign rice to Africa in recent times”. \n‘’Action would commence to impound all foreign rice seen in the state within two weeks of this statement.”",

    "text": "Former Toronto mayor John Sewell was inspired to sponsor a Syrian refugee family early last year, long before the images of little Alan Kurdi shocked the world into action. He reached out to his neighbours in the Bathurst and St. Clair area to ask if they wanted to help. The response was overwhelmingly positive — and in July 2015 the Hillcrest Sponsorship Group was born. \n“I’m amazed at how relatively easy it has been with our family,” said Sewell, who teamed up with 20 or so others who live near Hillcrest Community School to give a family uprooted by war a chance at a new life.\nThe Suleymans — parents, Omar and Aleye, and their two daughters and a son — arrived in February and settled into a fully furnished apartment in the part of the city known as Little Arabia, near Victoria Park and Lawrence. The kids were enrolled in school immediately, and “have thrived,” he said.\nThe group had initially raised $40,000 to support the family who had been living in Ankara, Turkey, after fleeing their home in war-torn Aleppo. They have since collected another $5,000 to $6,000 to pay for dental care. \n  The months have flown by since the family arrived, but it’s gone “shockingly well,” said Sewell.\nThe most challenging thing for the adults has been learning English, Sewell said. But even then, they have done “pretty well,” with lots of ESL classes and a desire to work. \n“I keep comparing Omar to me,” he said. “You want to teach me Arabic in this age of my life, c’mon!”\nSuleyman, who worked as a cook for some time in Turkey, had been eager to start work, and the group was able to land him jobs in short-order kitchens. But his lack of English has been a little roadblock, so private classes will continue. The group recently hired an English tutor to come to his home after work. \n“It’s been a tremendously positive experience,” said Mary McConville, one of the sponsors. “Despite the challenges … like learning English, adapting to a new culture, leaving family back home, and dealing with the adjustment of leaving a conflict zone …” \nAnd what happens when the sponsorship group’s year of support is over? The group has already started planning for that — with three members tasked with watching the budget.\n“The family has been living within the budget. Nobody is feeling shortchanged. We are going to have money left over after the year is over,” said Sewell. \nAnd even when the year is over, McConville is certain the friendship, and ties to the community will continue. \n“We don’t think of this as before and after,” she said.\n“We have developed strong relationships to the family and will continue to support them,” she said. “But in the meantime, we are trying to do whatever we can to prepare them for independence.”",

    "text": "Fidel Castro proved as divisive in death as he was in life, with enemies and admirers agreed only on his place in the history books, as a towering figure who transformed a small Caribbean island into a major force in world affairs.\nMourning and celebrations began together, soon after his brother and successor president Raúl announced that old age and illness had finally done what the CIA could not manage in hundreds of assassination attempts, and carried the Cuban leader away.\nThe news was broken on Cuban state television in the early hours of Saturday morning. With a shaking voice, Raúl Castro ended the announcement with the slogan associated with the Cuban revolution: “Hasta La Victoria Siempre.”\nAfter six decades dominating his country, and often the world stage, Fidel Castro was both feted around the world as icon, hero and inspiration, and condemned as tyrant and autocrat.\n“It’s the end of an era. In his time he managed to leave no one indifferent,” said Cuban playwright Norge Espinosa Mendoza. “His charisma, his speeches, his impulses and also his errors gave the world another view of Cuba .”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Castro in 1973. Photograph: Sipa Press / Rex Features \nUS President Barack Obama was one of the few to respond to Castro ’s passing with little emotion. A thawing of relations with Cuba was one of the landmark foreign policy achievements of his presidency, and his cautious, lawyerly statement devoid of criticism or praise seemed focused on the same goal, of burying the two nations’ bitter past so they can focus on future ties.\n“We extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people. We know that this moment fills Cubans – in Cuba and in the United States – with powerful emotions, recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives, families, and of the Cuban nation,” Obama said.\n“History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him,” he said, echoing perhaps unwittingly one of Castro’s most famous declarations – “history will absolve me”.\nObama’s successor, president-elect Trump, was less measured. A cryptic initial Twitter response to the news, the statement “Fidel Castro is dead!” was followed three hours later with a full-throated condemnation of the Castro regime’s human rights abuses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest President Obama: ‘History will record and judge his enormous impact of this singular figure on the people around him.’ Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty Images \n“Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights,” the official Trump statement said.\nThat feeling was echoed in Miami, home to the largest Cuban-American community. Little Havana was filled with impromptu street parties, salsa, fireworks and shouts of “ Cuba Libre ” filled the air, as thousands gathered to rejoice after news that had been announced prematurely many times before was finally confirmed.\nIn Havana itself, there was sadness and shock, even though Castro had been frail for years. “I feel this in my heart,” said Mario Astoria, a security guard sitting outside the Bacardi building, which a triumphant Fidel seized in the 1960s.\nHis death may bring little immediate practical change but for many Cubans it is a landmark moment.\n“This man who decided every detail of the Cuba in which I was born and grew up, is no longer here. There is a strange lightness spread over the island,” said blogger Yoani Sanchez.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Russian president Putin hailed Castro as a ‘symbol of an era’. Photograph: Mikhail Metzel/TASS \nCondolences poured in from across Latin America, from veterans of the anti-apartheid struggle he supported in southern Africa, from the Soviet and Russian leaders who propped up then abandoned his government, and from admirers of the free medicine and education he brought to the island.\nCastro was hailed as a “symbol of an era” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a “true comrade and friend” by China’s President Xi Jinping, and in one of the warmest tributes, South African President Jacob Zuma celebrated a key ally in the fight against South Africa’s apartheid regime.\nHe had outlived six US presidents, most of the allies and opponents of his revolutionary years, and even the struggles of the cold war, that defined perhaps the most dramatic period of his rule, the Cuban missile crisis.\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn praised Castro’s “heroism” but not all of Europe was keen to embrace him. Soon after EU President Jean-Claude Juncker described him as “a hero for many”, trade commissioner Cecilia Malmström publicly questioned the outpouring of praise. “Fidel Castro was a dictator who oppressed his people for 50 years. Strange to hear all the tributes,” she said.",

Photograph: Alamy Richard Morris is UK chief executive of workplace consultancy Regus Monday 28 November 2016 07.00 GMT Last modified on Monday 28 November 2016 07.03 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nEvery day, 21.18 million people in the UK work nine to five. This may seem intuitive – we all know people tend to work best during daylight hours. But even within these parameters, individuals have very different sleep-wake patterns. \nOur internal body clock is a natural process governed by circadian rhythms that regulate levels of energy and alertness throughout the day. So when we experience jetlag, or a lack of sleep, this interferes with our ability to think . \nMuch research has been done on when we work best, but little of that knowledge has filtered through to the workplace. The average employee will take a few hours after arriving at work to reach peak alertness at around noon. This peak then subsides until around 3pm. After this low, alertness tends to increase again until a second peak at 6pm. Then it’s a steady decline until the ultimate low at 3.30am. Finally, alertness climbs again and the cycle repeats. \nThis, however, is the average cycle with people deviating hugely. Some fall into early morning achievers (larks), while others work better in the evening (owls). \nConsider the typical working day: a 7.30am start; a stressful commute to reach a fixed point before 9am; an hour for lunch often spent at the desk; and a tiring commute home leaving work at 5pm each day. \nThe notion of the nine-to-five working day was established in Victorian times, not an age much aware of worker welfare, and it is easy to see the conflict between this fixed structure and our natural circadian rhythms. \nSo how can businesses adapt? Already numerous companies are rejecting this outdated idea of a fixed working routine and embracing flexible working. \nThis change is as much down to changing mindsets as with re-organising business locations. Today’s managers are learning to measure on results rather than presenteeism. Many no longer regard workplace flexibility as a perk – it is expected. Given these changing values, business leaders are quickly learning how to get the most from employees, even if they do not see them on a day-to-day basis. Struggling to sleep? Five tips for insomniacs Read more \nWith the early evening peak of alertness occurring precisely when a vast majority of workers are wrestling with motorways or public transport on their commute home, what if that commute were simply eliminated? It’s won’t work for everyone, but there are a large percentage of professionals travelling unnecessarily to a fixed location. How much more productive these individuals could be if they worked nearer to home, arrived at the workplace fresh, and did not have to worry about leaving exactly on time in the evening in order to get back? \nSolutions are available today. Businesses of every size and in every sector are consuming flexible workspace and a new pattern is emerging which aims to fit the workplace around the worker, rather than vice versa. \nClearly, this change is being driven by much more than acknowledgement of the internal body clock. Business leaders are looking at empty desk space in centralised offices and understanding the wasted expense. They are listening to workers struggling with the daily cost and frustration of commuting. And they are embracing flexible working to attract the best employees. \nWhat this flexible approach provides is a way to tailor working times to individuals’ body clocks, in a way that isn’t feasible under a fixed structure. \nWhether employers are quite ready to allow individuals to nap during the day during low-energy spells is a moot point. But there is certainly receptiveness for improved workplace wellbeing and for trusting employees to maximise their output on their own terms. \nGiving a little scientific thought to the process of productivity – and allowing owls and larks to beat their wings to a different rhythm – works best for everyone. \nLooking for a job?

Tragic Ayeeshia Jane Smith suffered horrifying injuries (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nHer partner, Matthew Rigby, also 23, was cleared of the toddler's murder, but found guilty of causing or allowing her death and jailed for three-and-a-half years. \nBy its verdicts, the jury decided Smith delivered the fatal blow, described during the trial as \"probably a stamp\" which tore the toddler's heart. \nSmith, of Overseal, Swadlincote, Derbyshire, today challenged her conviction at the Appeal Court, in London, with her lawyers arguing it was \"unsafe\". \nHer barrister, John Butterfield QC - who also represented her at trial - argued that an interruption by the trial judge as he made his closing speech in Smith's defence caused \"prejudice\" in the minds of jurors. Matthew Rigby was cleared of murder but found guilty of causing or allowing the child's death (Photo: Staffordshire Police/PA) \nMr Butterfield said Mrs Justice Andrews' intervention had the effect of painting him as someone who was \"sly enough\" to make points he shouldn't have been making. \nThe barrister added: \"The judge weighed in and weighed in in a way that was wrong, I say, on a number of different levels, in the middle of defence counsel's closing address. \n\"It is hard to understate just how devastating this was to the credibility of the defence case. \n\"To trespass on the closing remarks at all was a risk and was likely to have consequences. \n\"But to trespass on them to the extent and degree that was done here was dramatic and it cannot be said that the conviction is safe, I'm afraid, because of these matters.\" Ayeeshia Smith suffered horrifying abuse in the home (Photo: Staffordshire Police/PA) \nChristopher Hotten QC, who acted for the prosecution at trial, argued the judge's interruption did not render the conviction unsafe and urged top judges to uphold it. \nThe Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Wyn Williams and Mr Justice Goss, said the court would take some time to consider all the arguments before reaching a decision. \nHe also said that, in the event her conviction appeal does not succeed, they will review the minimum jail term handed to Smith. \nTheir judgment will be given at a later date.

    "text": "Adrian Heath says \"Experience is gonna be big'' for Minnesota Utd's chances November 29, 2016 3:06PM EST Jeff Rueter Contributor \nIn some ways, it’s deja vu all over again for Adrian Heath. \nAfter following his previous organization from Austin to Orlando and then from USL to MLS, Heath had become synonymous with Orlando City SC. His lively personality and vocal presence on the sidelines was endearing to fans, and the Lions nearly made the postseason in 2015 before falling just below the red line. \nWhile he joins another club moving from a lower division to MLS, there’s a different feel this time around, as Minnesota United signed Heath to a multi-year deal. With one eye looking to the past, Heath -- who was let go at midseason this year and replaced by Jason Kreis -- acknowledged that he’ll be circling the club’s date with Orlando once the schedule comes out. \nMy one big disappointment with my time in Orlando is how we finished it,\" Heath said. \"I think it would be nice, I think the word you use in America is ‘closure.’ For me to go back to the stadium that I helped design, with everything that’s gone on there in the past couple of years -- the colors, the stadium, I had a hand in all of that. It would be nice to go back and say a goodbye to all of the people who have been incredible to me and my family.” \nHeath said he’s looking to bring the same high-energy, fast-paced brand of football that made Orlando one of the league’s most exciting teams from day one. That said, one of the biggest appeals of the Minnesota position for Heath is the amount of MLS experience in the front office. \n“It’s an experienced league, and we had the youngest team by probably two years in 2015,\" he said. \"Experience is gonna be big for us moving forward. \n“I think that not just Manny, but (Director of Player Personnel) Amos Magee being here is massive. He’s been through it with Portland and DC, who are probably one of the better clubs in the league at generating an experienced club that can compete.” \nOne lesson he learned from his time in Orlando is putting a greater focus on the defensive side. A former attacker in his playing days, Heath’s teams spent most of the match in the attacking half of the field, leaving his defense vulnerable to counterattacks. With December’s Expansion Draft just around the corner, you can bet that defense will be a major focus as the club acquires MLS veterans. \nThat expansion draft may allow Heath to acquire a former player of his. While he acknowledged that Cyle Larin will not be available to him (“though I would take him if he was”), he sees plenty of players that he might try to bring in for his first year in Minnesota. \n“There are a few player on Orlando’s roster that every team in the league would want,\" he said. \"We’ll see what they leave us to pick from, but they’ve got some quality players. I want to pick the players that are right for us. It does help when you’ve worked with players, but for me, I have a very distinct way to play football.” \nHeath confirmed that 2016 Minnesota United assistant Ian Fuller would be back in the same capacity for 2017. Fuller was one of Heath’s primary assistants both in USL and MLS and will look to rekindle their connection next year. He expects the rest of his coaching staff to be filled by the end of this week. \nYou can find Jeff on Twitter at @jeffrueter .",

Manager Mike Matheny looks on. (Chicago Tribune photo by John J. Kim / chicagotribune.com) \nST. LOUIS • While his official role with the team ended before the start of the 2014 season, St. Louis-based orthopedic surgeon George Paletta maintained a presence with the Cardinals helping many players return to the field because the players requested him. \nNow he's returned to it too, complete with a title. \nThe Cardinals announced Tuesday that Paletta will return as the team's Head Orthopedic Physician. The team also announced that Paletta will work with the physicians at Mercy Health East Sports Medicine. \nThe Cardinals entered into a sponsorship agreement with Mercy almost three years ago, and since then Mercy has been a guiding element of diagnosis and treatment when it comes to injuries. The paid agreement includes Mercy being able to advertise the relationship with the team. \nA release from the team outlined other doctors who will work with the Cardinals for the 2017 season, including some familiar faces (Dr. Lyndon Gross) and newcomers with Mercy: \nJoining Paletta as Team Orthopedists are Gross, Dr. Husam Nawas, Dr. Mahesh Bagwe and Dr. Julienne Lippe. Dr. Brian Mahaffey returns as the team’s Primary Care Sports Medicine & Minor League Liaison and is also joined in that role by Dr. Alok Sengupta. Dr. Josh Binek will continue to serve as Team Internist and Independent Concussion Specialist Dr. Brandon Larkin also returns in 2017. New to the Cardinals medical staff next season will be Mercy Chief Administrative Officer Dr. Charles Rehm and Independent Vision Consultant Dr. Adam Fedyk. \nAlthough Paletta last had a title with the Cardinals during the 2013 season, he recently performed the surgery on Tyler Lyons to aid healing in the lefthander's knee, plus in the past two year's he performed the surgeries on Adam Wainwright (Achilles'), Seth Maness (elbow), and Mitch Harris (elbow). Players have sought him out for second opinions and for surgical procedures. \n“We are excited to have George and his team back and serving the Cardinals medical needs,” general manager John Mozeliak said in a released statement. “George brings a wealth of experience and familiarity to the organization and he is well-respected within the baseball community.” \nDerrick Goold",

    "text": "Story highlights Woodward was 11 when, he says, Barry Bennell began abusing him in the 1980s After a 30-year silence, he says he's speaking now in the hope of helping other victims (CNN) Andy Woodward's dream was to become a professional footballer, an aspiration wrecked by a \"monster\" and \"master of control\" who sexually abused him.\nSpeaking to CNN on Monday, Woodward described former football coach Barry Bennell, a convicted pedophile at the heart of allegations surrounding widespread child sex abuse in English football during the 1980s and 1990s, as a man who wielded such power that he would use blackmail to ensure a web of secrecy and deceit. After a 30-year silence, Woodward, a former football player, told The Guardian newspaper his story of abuse last week, which prompted a number of other men to share their own stories of suffering at Bennell's hands. 'He had the power to do what he wanted' \"He was the master of control,\" 43-year-old Woodward told CNN. Read More \"His coaching ability was the best in the country so he had that tool, but then alongside that he also had the power in football and as person to manipulate as many people as he wanted because it's your inspiring dream to be a footballer. \"Every kid is feeling that. The feeling of that drive and then having someone in control of you, they go hand in hand. He had the power to do what he wanted, when he wanted, where he wanted.\" Woodward began his professional career at Crewe Alexandra. In 1998, Bennell was jailed for nine years after pleading guilty to 23 charges of sexually abusing six children. Woodward was among his victims at Crewe football club. He has been jailed three times for child abuse, including once in the United States where he was reportedly described by Florida police as having \"almost an insatiable appetite\" for young boys. Bennell was convicted and sentenced to prison most recently in 2015 for two years for a past sexual offense against a 12-year-old boy. 'Taunting' Woodward was 11 when the abuse began in the mid-1980s. He first met Bennell after being invited to train with one of his teams in Manchester before being sent to Crewe, a club well known for developing young players. For Woodward, being accepted at Crewe was a step closer to achieving the dream of becoming a professional footballer. But behind that goal lurked Bennell, a man who was accused of targeting the \"weaker boys\" to fulfill his fantasies. Bennell's ability to manipulate his victims, either physically or by threatening to drop them from the team and harm their progress, instilled fear in the young players. Woodward said he became introverted; the happy-go-lucky young boy gave way to a far quieter, more withdrawn persona. Totally recharged and start of a new week. I'm determined and driven to protect and help anyone i can. This was wrong on every level.\n— Andy Woodward (@AndyWoodward2) November 28, 2016 Woodward said Bennell threatened him, telling him that if he breathed a word to anyone of the abuse it would be the end of his career. Frightened and intimidated, Woodward told nobody. \"We didn't talk about it,\" he said about his fellow footballers. \"There was always taunting at Crewe by older players, but those of us within the same kind of age never talked about it. The older pros used to heckle me in the dressing room and stuff like that.\" The abuse and the secrets consumed him. He began to enjoy some success after joining Bury, a club in the north of Manchester, in 1995. But even then, it was a struggle. His life became punctuated by depression, suicidal thoughts and helplessness. 'Relief' \"It was a relief to get out of Crewe but I still felt locked in,\" he said. \"I just wanted to play football and I had to put up with the surroundings and people and get on with it. \"All I wanted to do was get on the pitch and fight the demons which were inside. It was the turning point for me. I broke down and cried for hours. The first time in my adult life. USA 🇺🇸 THIS IS REAL LIFE SAVING\n— Andy Woodward (@AndyWoodward2) November 28, 2016 \"But did I fulfill my potential? Absolutely not, nowhere near.\" Woodward recalled how during his career there were times where he just wouldn't play at all. In 10 years he started just 154 league matches before retiring in 2002. Even after confiding in two of his coaches at Bury, where he moved in 1995, and after Bennell was jailed in 1998, Woodward continued to be haunted by demons. 'Taboo' While Woodward began to showcase some of the form to which his potential had pointed, he was rarely free. \"If you look at my career, I had dips where I disappeared for a while,\" he said. \"They weren't injuries; they were mental illnesses. I suffered massively. I didn't come forward around the mental side of it, it was all about keeping it secret. \"I didn't want anyone to see any vulnerability in me. In that day and age, mental health wasn't thought about, it was a very big taboo.\" That taboo was not one that only Woodward was afraid to break. Wider net In the past week, former England and Manchester City player David White, and Steve Walters, formerly of Crewe, have also revealed they were among Bennell's victims, though it is unclear whether Bennell was convicted of abusing them. Paul Stewart, who played for Tottenham and Liverpool, said another unnamed coach had repeatedly sexually assaulted him and threatened to kill his family if he spoke out. Last Friday, two more victims came forward to tell their own stories of abuse. Chris Unsworth , now 44, was a youth team player at Manchester City before moving to Crewe with Bennell. Jason Dunford has also spoken out, alleging that Bennell attempted to touch him while he was in bed at a holiday camp. Barry Bennell hospitalized amid football abuse scandal Woodward said he has received hundreds of messages from former players, some of whom were abused, and some who have said they feel guilty that they failed to help their friends at the time. And yet, there were moments when he considered stopping cooperating with The Guardian for its story altogether. He thought of his children, the potential damage it could do to them and of his own life and how speaking out would make him vulnerable. Woodward spoke with his kids before the story went live on The Guardian. \"They just said, 'go for it Dad',\" he said of one of the most difficult conversations of his life. He said he plans to sit down with them all once more in the near future to \"catch up and show them all the wonderful reaction\" he's received. 'Humbled' On Monday morning, he received a message from the United States from a man who had seen the interview Woodward gave on television. \"A guy sent me a direct message on Twitter and told me that he had seen my interview and that it brought out all the feelings that he had gone through after being abused,\" he said. \"He said that he was watching with his wife, who he had been with for over 30 years, and decided that he had to tell her. I was humbled and touched.\" Woodward told CNN he never expected his tale to become worldwide news, but now that it has, he is determined to ensure nobody has to endure what he has been through over the past 30 years. \"I want to reach out further afield beyond football and sport. It can give people that inner strength,\" he said \"The story has a positive spin on it now and I can feel it. It was really emotional and I can't tell you what emotions I've had over the past week. \"I am starting to feel that it is making a difference. I want to push forward and reach out. \"I am a regular guy. I was a footballer but I'm not now. This is about people and people's lives. I want to help.\" Visit cnn.com/football for more news and videos",

    "text": "For the longest time, it felt Justin Trudeau could do no wrong. Even as political leaders across the west fell out of favor, Canada’s handsome Prime Minister remained a popular symbol of liberal ideas. Until this weekend.\nOn Saturday, Trudeau tweeted out a statement on Fidel Castro, expressing his “deep sorrow” about the death of the Cuban dictator and describing him as “a larger than life leader who served his people for almost half a century.”\nTrudeau added Castro, who was a friend of his late father, was a “controversial figure” but also said the Cuban people would maintain a “deep and lasting affection for el Comandante.” He concluded it was a “real honour” to meet Castro’s family on a recent visit.\nThe reaction was scorching. Social media lit up with a satiric hashtag #TrudeauEulogies in which posters imagined Trudeau’s farewells to other tyrants:\n\"Mr. Stalin's greatest achievement was his eradication of obesity in the Ukraine through innovative agricultural reforms.\" #TrudeauEulogies\n— Melissa Lantsman (@MelissaLantsman) November 26, 2016\nWhile controversial, Emperor Palpatine brought order to the galaxy, ending a separatist movement & making tech advancements #TrudeauEulogies\n— Typing Panda (@TypingPanda) November 27, 2016\nMeanwhile, politicians across the globe piled on, including Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), a Cuban-American from Miami:\nIs this a real statement or a parody? Because if this is a real statement from the PM of Canada it is shameful & embarrassing. https://t.co/lFXeqU7Ws0\n— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) November 26, 2016\nBack in Canada, Trudeau’s remarks didn’t go over much better. The country’s national magazine, Maclean’s , described the episode as “Trudeau’s turn from cool to laughing stock” and said the comments exposed the Prime Minister’s “foreign policy vacuity.” Worse, it appeared to puncture a carefully cultivated public image:\nTrudeau made himself synonymous with Canada. He made Canada cool again. It was fun while it lasted.\nBy the early hours of Saturday morning, Havana time, Trudeau was an international laughing stock. Canada’s “brand,” so carefully constructed in Vogue photo essays and Economist magazine cover features, seemed to suddenly implode into a bonspiel of the vanities, with humiliating headlines streaming from the Washington Post to the Guardian , and from Huffington Post to USA Today .\nEven left-leaning outlets in Canada and elsewhere appeared uncomfortable with Trudeau’s remarks.\nIn response to the controversy, Trudeau attempted to defend his statement on Sunday, conceding that Castro was a dictator, but also reaffirming his original sentiments.\nThe fuss over the remarks will eventually pass as the media moves on to other issues. But for Trudeau, the Castro comment is likely to be remembered as a permanent tarnish on a once-beautiful brand.",

    "text": "Photographer Pedrinho Fonseca is determined to bring up his young son Joao as a feminist, in contrast to the intense chauvinism he himself witnessed as a child in his home region in Brazil. He tells BBC's 100 Women about what influences made him change course, and how he tries to help Joao move away from perceptions fostered by an entrenched culture.\nI come from a very sexist place.\nI was born in the north-east of Brazil - a poor region that absorbed what was worst during the time of Portuguese colonial rule: the concept of domination. We were populated by white and wealthy men who enslaved Africans and left us a legacy that relationships should be ruled by this logic.\nMen from this area have grown up with the notion that they are owners; they have possessions, which can be land or other human beings, especially women. Thus they are responsible for bringing home the money, but no affection.\nAnd women are expected to serve them. Centuries later, we are still growing up getting this same information that we can do anything - and that women exist to please us only. This twisted scenery has built generations of complete sexism.\nNo gender issue But many years later, with the arrival of my son, João, I realised that I needed to be a point of reference for him, completely different from the men I had known as a child, so he could grow up with another perception of the world.\nWatching a child grow up: Have you seen the beginning of a river? It is tiny. There is no water flow, nothing to show that this small puddle will eventually be defined by a course, miles away, as an abundant river. Every river is, in its essence, a surprise for those who follow it.\nSuddenly it has crossed rocks, poured through valleys, sculpted green banks, jumped through waterfalls, wet the feet of women washing their family's clothes.\nThis is what it is like to watch a child grow up.\nThe men, the providers, fold their arms, ignoring the most simple human tasks such as cleaning the house, making the bed, cooking, washing the dishes, watering the plants, shopping for groceries. Their duty is to walk away in the morning, work to bring back some money, come back to sleep, and the next day, start all over again. This pattern is the norm for many generations, even the current one, particularly in north-eastern Brazil.\nI was raised in this atmosphere. And this was the template I was used to. It never occurred to me to question it because it is such an entrenched part of the culture, a symbol of historic domination ruled by the idea that women exist to serve.\nMy course, my natural perception of this world where men have a voice, and women do not, was interrupted by the birth of my first child. Suddenly here was someone who might follow the pre-established course for a Brazilian man - but I couldn't allow him to do that.\nNow, there was another man in my house, and his arrival brought the possibility of change, for both him and me.\nTips for fathers of boys Invite him to wash the dishes with you. Then, you can clean the house (including the bathroom!). And, later I think you'll like cooking together. It is fun and probably will make your son understand there should be no gender issue when you're taking care of your own home. Play football with him and his friends - don't forget to invite the girls to play with you! If you're the father, never, never, never interrupt your son's mum when she's talking - it's important for him to follow your example. And, please: tell your son, day after day, there is no reason to think women like violence. They don't. In fact no-one does. I, who had never previously appreciated the role of my mother in my life, started to see her in another way. She had virtually raised me by herself, played all the parts: she worked all day long, but also took care of me all the time, cooked, gave me love, and soothed my small childhood and adolescence pains.\nI, who had never understood that a partnership could have a political and ethical dimension and that I could fight for gender equality, discovered even more about women's power through my wife, Lua. And listening to her voice inside the house and outside in the world, defending women's potential, João can start to follow a course I didn't.\nJoao must get clear values early on, before he becomes a man, his father believes Fonseca believes it is only possible to achieve gender equality if we start with our children Pedrinho's wife Lua has been one of the key influences on his thinking I understood that it is impossible to achieve social sexual equality unless we start with how we treat our children. And when I show him my affection and love, when we share household chores between the whole family (Joao has two younger sisters), when he realises that the norm should be to respect women's voices and bodies, I feel that he can observe the world from a new place. Not somewhere that I, nor a huge portion of my generation, came from, but definitely where we must go.\n'Done something wrong' Does Joao ever say anything sexist? Yes - it happens when he is distracted. He is a young child who is still hit by sexist values. For example, he told us that during a school break all the pupils ran to the playground to play football. When they got there, the boys told the girls they should find something else to do.\nHe brought up this story during dinner - because, according to him, he \"felt he had done something wrong, but did not know what\". We talked and told him that the mistake was to try and decide for the girls what THEY should do and to assume that playing football could not be a 'girl thing'.\nWe talked, he listened, asked questions and the next day when he got home from school, told us he had apologised to the girls for what had happened.\nAll photographs: Pedrinho Fonseca\nWhat is 100 women?

    "text": "Where it all began. Photo: Mario Tama/Getty Images Donald Trump will not use charitable funds raised by his foundation to pay off a recent $25 million settlement related to fraud lawsuits against Trump University.\nNews broke on Friday that Trump had agreed to pay off three separate lawsuits relating to the controversial “university.”\nDuring his campaign it was discovered that Trump had used funds raised by his charitable organization, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, to settle lawsuits against him and his companies. But on Monday, Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten wrote to the New York attorney general’s office promising that his client would not use any charitable funds to settle the cases. “No part of the funding of my clients’ settlement of the New York Attorney General Action or the California Actions will come from any charitable foundation or other charitable entity,” Garten said.\nIt has since emerged that the attorney general insisted on the guarantee in light of Trump’s past activities. Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general, confirmed that “given Mr. Trump’s reported history of using his charity’s money to fund his and his businesses’ legal settlements, we demanded written assurance that the Trump University settlement would not be paid for by any charitable entity.”\nDuring his campaign Trump would often boast about how he never settled lawsuits and vociferously defended Trump University calling it “beautiful” and “wonderful.” In light of his recent decision to settle, Trump took to Twitter to blame the settlement on the inconvenience of assuming the presidency of the United States.\nThe ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2016",

    "text": "Drugs, alcohol not involved in bus crash; 6th child dies Associated Press 2 hrs ago By JONATHAN MATTISE and ERIK SCHELZIG, Associated Press CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — A school bus driver had no drugs or alcohol in his system when he careened off a road and smashed into a tree, killing six elementary schoolchildren, police said Wednesday.\nChattanooga Police Sgt. Austin Garrett said a toxicology test was performed on Johnthony Walker, 24, the bus driver now in jail on five vehicular homicide charges.\nLater Wednesday, the police department said in a statement that a sixth child had died of injuries from the crash and another vehicular homicide charge would be added.\nFederal authorities said Walker left the designated bus route and had driven onto a curvy road while carrying 37 children on their way home from Woodmore Elementary School.\nPolice said he was driving well over the posted 30 mph limit when he lost control of the bus and slammed into a tree. Five children remain in the hospital.\nNational Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A. Hart says it's unclear why driver Walker left the designated route and drove the bus down Talley Road.\n\"One of the things we're exploring is A, has he done it before, and B, if so, why?\" Hart said.\nHe said Walker, who has no criminal record in the state, had taken on a second job at an Amazon Fulfillment Center, and part of the agency's investigation will look at whether fatigue played a role in the wreck.\nThe NTSB will also bring in a specialist to analyze video and audio recordings from the bus's interior cameras that were damaged in Monday's wreck.\n© The Associated Press Children get a goodbye hug as students are picked up from Woodmore Elementary School on Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016, in Chattanooga, Tenn. The school bus driven by Johnthony Walker, 24, crashed while transporting children home from the school Monday, killing at least five students. Walker was arrested Monday and charged with five counts of vehicular homicide including reckless driving and reckless endangerment, police said. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey) Police disputed one woman's claim that the driver asked the children if they were \"prepared to die\" just before the wreck. Jasmine Mateen, whose 6-year-old daughter was among the dead, said one of her two surviving children who were on the bus told her about the driver's remarks.\nGarrett, however, said at a Wednesday press conference: \"I want to be very clear on this. No witness we have spoken with has that information or provided it directly to our investigators.\"\nHe added that investigators have not yet interviewed the children on the bus and asked anyone with additional information to bring it to police.\nThree of the children killed were in fourth grade, one in first grade and another in kindergarten, said Kirk Kelly, interim superintendent of Hamilton County schools. The age and identity of the sixth child wasn't immediately released. A makeshift memorial to them grew up around a telephone pole, with stuffed bears, flowers and dozens of balloons.\nTheir families remembered them as fun, happy children taken much too soon.\nD'Myunn Brown liked to play little tricks on grown-ups. The 6-year-old would snatch a cellphone, hide it, then giggle and bat his big brown eyes.\n\"That's what made him so pretty, and he was as sweet as he could be,\" said his great-grandmother, Winifred Bray. \"I'm still numb. I still can't believe he's gone.\"\nLaFrederick Thirkill remembered his 9-year-old cousin, Cordayja Jones, as a girly-girl who liked dressing up and giving hugs.\nThirkill is the principal at Orchard Knob Elementary, where Cordayja attended before changing schools to Woodmore Elementary.\nShe was a polite little girl, he said. Even though he was her cousin, she called him \"Mr. Thirkill\" when she saw him in the hallways.\n\"I remember her as just a kid who always smiles,\" he said.\nSchool officials repeatedly declined to answer questions Wednesday about whether they received complaints about the driver. School Principal Brenda Adamson-Cothran said their focus is on \"giving our families and students the support that they need in this tragedy.\"\nWalker was involved in another bus accident only two months ago, police said. In September, he was driving the bus into a blind curve when he crossed over the center line and hit an SUV, according to a police report. No one was injured, and the damage to both vehicles was minor. He was not cited for any violations.\nHamilton County School District spokeswoman Amy Katcher referred all questions about his performance and that of other drivers to the company that manages them, Durham School Services.\nThe bus company did not respond to questions about its safety record or Walker's employment history. Durham CEO David A. Duke released a video statement expressing condolences to the families and pledging to work with investigators.\nA mother and 8-year-old son, who was injured in the crash, filed a lawsuit against Durham on Wednesday, attorney Herbert Thornbury confirmed. He said the boy suffered minor injuries, watched his best friend die and has been crying uncontrollably ever since. The lawsuit contends the boy may be permanently injured, sustained pain and suffering and will incur medical and other expenses as a result of the wreck.\nBased in Warrenville, Illinois, Durham operates about 13,700 vehicles across the U.S. and has nearly as many drivers, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\nThe company has had 346 crashes over two years, including three resulting in deaths and 142 with injuries, federal figures show. During that period, it had 53 incidents involving unsafe driving violations.\n___\nSchelzig reported from Nashville, Tennessee. Associated Press writer Claire Galofaro contributed from Louisville, Kentucky.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show there were 37 children on the bus, not 35.\nGo to MSN Home",

Now his government is proposing to lift restrictions on expats voting in Canadian elections. Photograph: Pool/Reuters Christopher Guly in Ottawa Thursday 24 November 2016 11.30 GMT View more sharing options Share on Messenger Close \nCanada’s Liberal government is poised to restore the voting rights of expatriates who have lived outside the country for five or more consecutive years. \nThe democratic institutions minister, Maryam Monsef, will on Thursday unveil legislation to reportedly remove that restriction, and help fulfil the Liberals’ election campaign promise to “make it easier for Canadians to vote”. \nIt is estimated that 1.4 million Canadians are affected by the current ban, which does not allow expats to receive a special mail-in ballot. \nAlthough the law has been in place since 1993, no one had ever challenged it until 2014 when Gillian Frank and Jamie Duong – two Canadians living in the United States – took the Canadian government to court after they were denied the right to vote in the 2011 Canadian general election. \nAn Ontario superior court judge agreed with them that their right to vote under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and therefore that section of the elections law was unconstitutional. Canadian election: 1.4m expatriates barred from voting after court ruling Read more \nBut the then Conservative government appealed against the ruling, which was reversed by Ontario’s top court , preventing expats who had lived outside Canada for five years or more from casting a ballot in last year’s Canadian general election. \nThe legal battle is not over. \nFrank and Duong have taken their fight to the supreme court of Canada , which will hear their case in February. \nOn the day Ottawa filed its response in Canada’s supreme court, Monsef issued a statement indicating that the government would introduce legislation to “meet the needs of highly mobile Canadian citizens who live in today’s increasingly interconnected world”. \nThe legislation is unlikely to pass before the supreme court hears the appeal next year. Ottawa could also file a motion to delay the hearing until passage of the bill, which could then render the case moot. \nFurthermore, such an amendment to Canada’s elections law will not affect many people, since only about 6% of expats cast ballots in general elections, according to Duff Conacher, co-founder of the Ottawa-based national citizens’ advocacy group, Democracy Watch. \n“But for those who want to vote, the prohibition is much too strict and should be changed,” he said.

This would lead to return of normalcy along Line of Control,\" the army statement said. India has accused Pakistani soldiers of providing cover to terrorists as they attempt to infiltrate India. \nIndia mounted a massive bombardment of Pakistani positions in retaliation of Tuesday's killings of Indian Jawans. Machine guns and 120 mm heavy mortars were used to target Pakistani army posts. \nPakistan authorities have claimed that 11 civilians and soldiers have died in India's retaliatory assault. \nTalks are held every Tuesday between army officers of both sides, though not always at the senior-most level. Despite the simmering tension at the border, this exercise had remained intact. \nTuesday's beheading of Prabhu Singh in Machil in Kupwara, about 80 kilometres from Srinagar is the second mutilation of an Indian soldier in three weeks by Pakistani troops.

    "text": "Nitrogen Cycle. Shirlie L Sharpe Updated October 23, 2015 . \nCall it cycling, nitrification , biological cycle, startup cycle, break-in cycle, or the nitrogen cycle. No matter what name you use, every newly set up aquarium goes through a process of establishing beneficial bacterial colonies. Older aquariums also go through periods during which the bacterial colonies fluctuate. Failure to understand this process is the largest contributing factor to the loss of fish. Learning what it is, and how to deal with critical periods during the nitrogen cycle, will greatly increase your chances of successful fish keeping. The Waste Problem Unlike nature, an aquarium is a closed environment. All the wastes excreted from the fish, uneaten food, and decaying plants, stay inside the tank. \ncontinue reading below our video How to Test for Nitrates and Nitrite in Freshwater Aquariums If nothing eliminated those wastes, your beautiful aquarium would turn into a cesspool in no time at all.Actually, for a short period of time, a new aquarium does become a toxic cesspool. The water may look clear, but don't be fooled. It's loaded with toxins, much like a septic tank. Sounds awful, doesn't it? Fortunately bacteria that are capable of converting wastes to safer by-products begin growing in the aquarium as soon as fish are added. Unfortunately there aren't enough bacteria to eliminate all the toxins immediately, so for a period of several weeks to a month or more, your fish are at risk.However, you need not lose them. Armed with an understanding of how the nitrogen cycle works and knowing the proper steps to take, you can sail through the break-in cycle with very few problems. Stages of the Nitrogen Cycle There are three stages of the nitrogen cycle, each of which presents different challenges. Initial stage: The cycle begins when fish are introduced to the aquarium. Their feces, urine, as well as any uneaten food, are quickly broken down into either ionized or unionized ammonia. The ionized form, Ammonium (NH4), is present if the pH is below 7, and is not toxic to fish. The unionized form, Ammonia (NH3), is is present if the pH is 7 or above, and is highly toxic to fish. Any amount of unionized Ammonia (NH3) is dangerous, however once the levels reach 2 ppm, the fish are in grave danger. Ammonia usually begins rising by the third day after introducing fish. Second stage: During this stage Nitrosomonas bacteria oxidize the ammonia, thus eliminating it. However, the by-product of ammonia oxidation is nitrite, which is also highly toxic to fish. Nitrites levels as low as low as 1 mg/l can be lethal to some fish. Nitrite usually begins rising by the end of the first week after introducing fish. Third stage: In the last stage of the cycle, Nitrobacter bacteria convert the nitrites into nitrates . Nitrates are not highly toxic to fish in low to moderate levels. Routine partial water changes will keep the nitrate levels within the safe range. Established tanks should be tested for nitrates every few months to ensure that levels are not becoming extremely high.Now that you know what is happening, what should you do? Simple steps such as water testing and changing the water will help you manage the nitrogen cycle without losing your fish. For details about what to do next, continue to Page 2. Prev",

DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX NZ \nSupporting Families at the mental health hub has been giving away bubble mixtures to children suffering from anxiety after the earthquakes. \n\"We have used them before. You're told to breathe deeply when you're feeling anxious, and so we started recommending them pretty much straight after the earthquake,\" Caughley said. \nREAD MORE: \nThe mental health hub, on Seymour St, has fielded a large increase in calls from parents who are concerned about their children after the earthquake on November 14. \nSome have panic or asthma attacks while other children struggle to sleep. \n\"One woman thought her daughter was going to die because she couldn't breathe,\" Caughley says. \nParents loved the idea of using bubble mixture, and even one adult found it helped with her own post-quake anxiety, she says. \n\"The best feedback came from her. If you're having a panic attack, it slows your heart rate down because you're breathing deeply, so it actually physically improves you. But us adults love blowing bubbles anyway.\" Ad Feedback \nSupporting Families has paid for the bubble mixtures out of their own operating costs, but it was a meagre sum compared to some of the other supports they pay for to help clients, Caughley says. \n\"The cost is so little, but it can make a huge difference. We do keep bottles in the office anyway, but I stocked up on extras after the earthquake, because I thought, well, we're going to need it.\" \nMany people have been walking through the doors of the mental health hub since it opened just three days before the earthquake struck, more than used to visit Supporting Families at its old Scott St office, Caughley says. \nIt was impossible to know if the increase was due to the added burden of post-quake stress, or the ease of walking through the door, she says. \n\"People are more than welcome to pop in or give us a call.\" - The Marlborough Express",

KEVIN STENT/FAIRFAX NZ \nHemi Te Poono has been found not guilty of murdering Samuel Culling in Palmerston North on August 5, 2015. \nCulling's body was found the next morning in Taieri Court, Palmerston North. \nREAD MORE * Hemi Te Poono goes on trial accused of Palmerston North killing \nMembers of Culling's family cried after the verdict was read out. \nOutside court, Detective Senior Sergeant Craig Sheridan said the family were upset and angry, and police would need time to digest the verdict before making any decisions about what to do from here. \nThe case had come with significant challenges, including having witnesses who would not usually work with police, but Sheridan said he felt police put together a credible case. \nThe case remains unsolved though, and is the second homicide to have this status for the Whatuira family. \nCulling is the son of John Whatuira​, whose nephew Wallace Whatuira​ was shot dead in Highbury in 2002. \nWallace was just 16 years old when he was found dead on the front lawn of a house in Coventry St, Highbury, on Waitangi Day. \nThree Mongrel Mob members were accused of being involved, but the prosecutions were withdrawn. \nAnother member of the Whatuira family, James Poto Whatuira​, also died after being shot. He died in Woodville on January 4, 2015, after being shot once in the side with a shotgun by Daniel Rei. \nNOT MUCH ARGUMENT OVER EVIDENCE \nThe Crown and defence did not disagree with many aspects of the evidence in Te Poono's trial. \nTe Poono got to Palmerston North on August 3, 2015, staying with his mother while he spent time visiting his children and their mother. \nHe met Culling on the night of August 4 in Highbury while knocking on doors in search of somewhere to buy drugs. \nThe pair met up the next evening, and Culling sent his last text message at 9.38pm while trying to get two girls to join himself and Te Poono. \nCulling was shot while sitting in the front passenger's seat of Te Poono's Mercedes Benz - his blood was found throughout the car - with wadding from the shotgun shell later found in Culling's brain. \nTe Poono dumped the body before parking his car in a Rongotea shed. \nHe left his blood-stained shoes and red bandanna there, and was eventually told to move on by police after the occupier saw a strange car in his shed at 2am on August 6, 2015. \nTe Poono threw his cellphone out the window, cleaned the car, burned or binned blood-stained items, and got rid of Culling's bag and possessions. \nHe did, however, keep Culling's sawn-off shotgun, but was seen dumping it in a skip bin on August 27. \nTe Poono admitted doing most of those things when he gave evidence in his defence, but said Culling was shot by someone who ran up to the car and pointed the gun through an open window in the Savage Cres area. \nHe said the pair had smoked methamphetamine on both nights, and were planning to stand over drug dealers to get more drugs. \nThere had been an incident in Bunnythorpe on August 4, when Culling tried to kick in the door of a drug house and fire a shotgun, and cars had also tried to pin them in near Savage Cres on August 5, Te Poono said. \nEither of those incidents could have been the spark for Culling being shot, although he had also been acting like he was on the run, Te Poono said. \nTe Poono did not give a statement to police before his trial, and Sheridan said that was the first time police had heard Te Poono's version of events. - Stuff",

Typhenie Johnson and her accused kidnapper Christopher Revill in happier times. \nInvestigators have since arrested Revill and charged him with kidnapping. \n“It’s been a living hell,” said Deborah Johnson Strub, the missing woman’s mother. “Someone has to know. You just don’t disappear.” \nThursday will make the first time in 25 years Johnson Strub will be without her daughter for Thanksgiving. \n“We just need her home,” said Johnson Strub, as she brushed tears away. “When you’re at Thanksgiving tomorrow and you look at your family you have, imagine your child not being there.” \nIt is a reality she struggles with as each minute ticks by with zero new clues. \n“I think she’s been lost in the shuffle from day one,” said Johnson Strub. \nWhile she appreciates all of the volunteers who continue to search , Strub says she is a little frustrated with investigators and the lack of any answers. \n“I feel that they’re sitting waiting for evidence or new leads to come drop on in front of them,” said Johnson Strub. \nShe also know she is not the only family suffering with a missing child. \n“I realize that there are so many missing, Amber alerts, missing people that are down here,” said Johnson Strub. “But as the mother, Typhenie’s always going to be the priority.” \nTo those in the community who have even the smallest bit of information tucked away in their minds, Johnson Strub hopes they are listening. \n“I’d pray to God that they’d come forward and say something, but until that happens I feel that we’re on our own to find her,” said Johnson Strub. \nFort Worth Police said there is no update on the case. \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

Steven Avery says \"it will be a Happy Thanksgiving after all.\" #MakingAMurderer \n— Kathleen Zellner (@ZellnerLaw) November 23, 2016 \nLast Friday, a federal appeals court in Chicago blocked the release of Brendan Dassey , Avery’s nephew, who was convicted of murder in 2007 for the killing of Teresa Halbach “pending the outcome of the appeal,” but the court did not explain its reasoning. \nA U.S. magistrate judge in August ruled the guilty verdict returned by a trial jury in 2007 against Dassey, now 27, was based on a coerced confession he gave as a 16-year-old with a learning disability. \nDassey and Avery were convicted in separate trials of killing Halbach, a freelance photographer, at Avery’s home and scrap yard in 2005. Her charred remains were found in an incineration barrel and a burn pit on Avery’s property, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Milwaukee. \nWATCH: Appeals court blocks ‘Making a Murderer’ subject Brendan Dassey’s release from prison \nDassey, then 17, was found guilty of first-degree intentional homicide, second-degree sexual assault and mutilation of a corpse. Avery was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide and unlawful possession of a firearm as a felon. Both were sentenced to life in prison. \nThe case was the subject of the 10-part documentary Making a Murderer , which questioned the handling of the investigation and the motives of Manitowoc County law enforcement officials. \nThe documentary, which first went into production 10 years ago, recounted how Avery was convicted of an earlier, unrelated rape and sent to prison in 1985, serving 18 years before DNA evidence exonerated him and he was released. \nAvery filed a $36 million federal lawsuit against the county, its former sheriff and district attorney in 2004. A year later, he and Dassey were accused of killing Halbach. \nThe Emmy-nominated documentary suggested that authorities planted evidence against both defendants, a claim rejected by the current sheriff. \nWith files from Reuters ",

The brief was presented as part of the government's case in an appeal of its approval of the Alton plan.\nTreaties to be put on display McNeil has said he believes the brief went too far and that the government's intent in court was to show that it had consulted on the project.\nDuring Thursday's meeting, the provincial archives will put the original documents associated with the early peace and friendship treaties between the Mi'kmaq and the Crown on display to be photographed and videotaped.\nMcNeil said that was the plan all along, although the symbolism will stand out even more given the controversy.\n\"To have this kind of thing happen, which is unnecessary ... gets in the way of actually continuing to make the progress that we've made with communities across the province,\" he said.\nThe Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Chiefs, which will be represented at Thursday's meeting, did not return a call seeking comment.\nMcNeil, who said he didn't see the brief before it was presented in court, said he is frustrated at how things turned out and he will convey that to the chiefs.\n\"The Supreme Court [of Canada] has settled this. We have a duty to consult and they have rights associated with their treaties,\" he said.\n© The Canadian Press, 2016",

Thom Rolfe, the executive director said it's unusual for them to turn women away.\n\"Shelters such as ours only see about 15 per cent of the abused women,\" Rolfe said. \"So we would see 300 women and 300 kids a year roughly and if that's only 15 per cent of the population, that's one of the reasons why we're full.\"\nWindsor man found guilty of attempted murder and arson Women who are turned away are asked to stay in constant contact with Hiatus House, checking in every day or more often if their situation changes.\n\"One of the main factors that maintains violence is social isolation, so the more that it's talked about publicly and the more conversations that happen about it the less likely it is that people are going to continue that behaviour,\" Rolfe said.\nOHL launches program to teach players respect for women He credits the OHL Onside program and the University of Windsor's bystander effect classes as two ways our community is taking steps to publicly talk about abuse.\n\"The key to really making a difference is the conversations that we have with each other about the fact that it exists, that it's not her fault, men can change and stop being violent,\" Rolfe said.\nThe Hiatus House is working with Leamington District memorial Hospital for an additional shelter in the county.\nSeeking help CBC spoke with a woman who was in an abusive relationship. She agreed to speak with us on the condition of anonymity. It started with verbal abuse, eventually leading to alienation from her family and then to physical violence.\nShe got help from Hiatus House, but says many of the resources are overused and most don't know of the services until they're in a situation where they have to get help.\n\"It worries me as a member of the community that we don't take domestic violence seriously and we don't provide the resources necessary for people to get access to help early on,\" she said. \"It outrages me because the criminal justice system doesn't take it seriously and people are not penalized appropriated when they do horrific things to other people.\"\nShe says women and families need support to leave situations safely.\n\"Providing external resources to the Hiatus House would be helpful, providing local resources, supporting the domestic violence unit and giving them the access that they need to get the resourcing that they need to provide help to people on a day-to-day basis.\"",

Tin of whale meat, anyone? Rakuten's online marketplace has plenty. (Image: AS/Rakuten) \nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) is now putting pressure on the five time European champions to force their new sponsor's hand and have them rid their marketplace of these items.

An EIA spokesperson told The Mirror, \" Barcelona is in a position to help stop the elephant slaughter by persuading its sponsor Rakuten to stop allowing elephant ivory products to be sold via its online marketplace\". \nThe wholesale slaughter of elephants due to demand in the ivory trade has been lambasted by several groups and now Barca find themselves in the firing line, as many feel they are in a position to take a stand against those who profit from the sales of such animal goods.

It's time to step back, acknowledge how wrong it is, and take a stand against it.\"\nThe plaintiff in the case is Glynis Rogers, a 29-year-old former member of the Canadian Armed Forces from Nova Scotia, but if the case proceeds, the class could include any women who claim similar treatment.\n30 Canadian Forces members punished for sexual misconduct, 97 cases ongoing 'Suffered in a great way' According to her statement of claim, Rogers joined the Canadian Armed Forces in 2006, and says she was subjected to persistent and systemic gender and sexual-orientation-based discrimination, bullying and harassment by male members, particularly during training.\nShe says female members were called names and treated as being weaker and inferior to male members.\nHalifax lawyer Ray Wagner filed a statement of claim against Ottawa with the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. (CBC)\nThe claim alleges the Attorney General of Canada is vicariously liable for the alleged misconduct.\n\nA spokesperson confirmed the Canadian Armed Forces had been served with the lawsuit, and said the government is deciding its \"next steps.\"\nWagner said it will likely be sometime next year before they know if the class-action suit will proceed.\nReal number of sex assault complaints in military higher than official figures, watchdog says Report found 'endemic' bad behaviour He said it's hoped the case would change the culture within the Armed Forces and give women a channel for reporting any abuse.\nWagner said an eventual case would seek damages, but the amount wouldn't be determined until its known how many women decide to be part of the class.\nIn a 2015 report, retired Supreme Court justice Marie Deschamps found bad behaviour was \"endemic\" in the military — an institution steeped in a macho culture that leaves women fearful to report abuse.\nAt the time, the Canadian military said it acknowledged two key findings in the report. It agrees with Deschamps that a misogynistic, highly sexualized culture pervades the Canadian military. The military brass also concurred that eradicating that culture will take a concerted effort from defence leadership.\nGen.

    "text": "In his bid to lead Alberta's Progressive Conservative party into an uncharted future, leadership candidate Jason Kenney appears to have a solid grip on the party's storied past.\nThe Kenney campaign published an alphabetical list on Wednesday of 50 former Tory MLAs said to be backing their candidate.\nUnder PC party rules, the statement said, all former PC MLAs who are Alberta residents have automatic delegate status, which will allow them to vote at the leadership convention in March.\nAmong the names are former cabinet ministers Steve West, Stockwell Day, Ty Lund, Ron Liepert and Ted Morton. There are six women on the list.\nResponse from political observers was swift and, in some cases, scathing.\n\"I'm finding it very surprising that Jason Kenney would be using those individuals as his main backers and flaunting them,\" said former Progressive Conservative MLA Thomas Lukaszuk. \"Those are the kind of individuals that, in 2016, you should be hiding as your backers and not being proud of.\n\"I don't think your radio program is long enough for the Quote: s from Steve West that offended Albertans over the years,\" Lukaszuk said.\nWest, a controversial cabinet minister under former premiers Don Getty and Ralph Klein, imposed major cutbacks in several departments he ran in the late-1980s and 1990s.\nLukaszuk said the bulk of the politicians who are backing Kenney represent the most conservative voices from past PC governments.\n\"Those were the individuals that caused Ralph Klein, and Ed Stelmach, and Alison Redford, and others a lot of grey hair, because you could never be conservative enough for those individuals. Later on they became the first supporters of the Wildrose.\"\nKenney and Lukaszuk have feuded in the past. In 2012, when he was federal immigration minister, Kenney sent an email to a fellow Conservative MP calling Lukaszuk \"a complete and utter asshole,\" a comment he later apologized for.\nAsked for comment on the Kenney backers, fellow PC leadership candidate Stephen Khan said he has respect for everyone on the list.\n\"We have a lot of support from past MLAs,\" Khan said. \"We're not going to advertise who that is (but) there may be a time when we do.

    "text": "With another stadium to build, will Arlington change its mind about mass transit? Filed under Transportation at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up   \nArlington residents will get another year of commuter bus service after the board of Dallas Area Rapid Transit approved a contract extension this month. But the future of public transit in Arlington beyond 2017 is anyone's guess. \nA year from now, DART will ask Arlington to decide whether it wants to join its service area. If Arlington declines, the traffic-clogged city of 388,000 will lose its single bus line. \nOne thing is clear: After another successful stadium referendum, the city doesn't have a full penny of sales tax revenue available to dedicate to DART. So if the agency wants Arlington to join, it may have to accept a portion of the 1 cent it requires now or allow the city to commit a penny many years down the road. \nWhat's less clear is whether the people of Arlington want to join DART or any transit agency. Voters there have rejected mass transit three times since 1979. Before Arlington's commuter bus line launched in 2013, it was considered the largest city in the U.S. without mass transit. Texas Rangers stadium vote passes in landslide \nMayor Jeff Williams said the Metro ArlingtonXpress or MAX bus line that connects riders from a commuter train station just north of the city to the University of Texas at Arlington is not enough to meet the city's transit demands. The City Council has formed a transportation advisory committee with 31 people to help figure out what Arlington needs and what choices it has. \n\"What's so important, and something that has been missing in the past, is building consensus on our transportation plan,\" he said. \nThe Arlington bus line has performed below expectations. Though city officials once hoped it would reach 500 trips per day , MAX is tallying between 275 and 300 daily trips, according to city statistics. \nWilliams supported a DART contract extension this year , but he also speaks enthusiastically about alternatives to diesel-fueled buses, such as battery-powered \"people mover\" vehicles and ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft. Also on his radar is a startup in Boston called Bridj that lets riders reserve a spot in a shuttle using a mobile app. Saliana Girmai waits aboard the Metro ArlingtonXpress bus at College Park Center in Arlington on Nov. 22. Rose Baca/Staff Photographer \nThe Fort Worth Transit Authority, or the T, partners with DART on the MAX bus line and is also trying to attract Arlington. In a master plan unveiled earlier this year, the T proposed a train station in the city as part of the Trinity Railway Express commuter line between Fort Worth and Dallas. \nMeanwhile, DART is working with Arlington on a system plan to identify potential services, routes and trip frequencies, plus a financial plan to determine the cost. Those plans are required as part of the city's contract with the agency. \nThat contract also comes with a deadline — at the end of the fourth year, Arlington has to commit to a plan for future membership or lose service in 30 days. That policy is more lenient than a previous version that ordered contracting cities to vote on membership in the fourth year. DART eases nonmember requirements for contract services \nDART officials say the agency's rules give them the flexibility to offer membership for less than 1 cent. Todd Plesko, vice president of planning and development, said the rules also allow Arlington to vote to dedicate a penny in the future once its debts are paid off, though he admitted that such a move \"may be a hard sell.\" \nPlesko told the DART board at a meeting Nov. 15 that Arlington doesn't think it has the resources for a rail-based system. The city has a quarter of a penny of sales tax revenue available. \nSome board members wondered whether the city will just push for a contractual relationship, and whether DART staff will recommend it. Plesko told the board that's not where DART is headed. \nBoard member Mark Enoch — representative for Garland, Rowlett and Glenn Heights — said Arlington should be pressed for a vote. \n\"What we're talking about is some level of membership,\" he said at the meeting. \"And membership — it might be a half penny, it might be a full penny, I don't know. I realize there's nobody out there right now knocking on our door to pay a full penny. ... The question is, are we going to make sure we hold out so when that happens, we can sell a product for a penny?\" \nGary Slagel, who represents Richardson, Addison and the Park Cities, asked the board to be adaptable, pointing to Arlington's success building stadiums. \n\"They've been able to pay for those things and move them on; it's pretty phenomenal the way they've been able to do it,\" Slagel said. \"I would never give up on them at this point and say, 'Well, if you don't have it now.'\" The Metro ArlingtonXpress bus stops at College Park Center in Arlington on Nov. 22. Rose Baca/Staff Photographer \nDART, which boasts the longest light rail network in the country, has struggled to add to its base of 13 member cities since forming in 1983. Over the years, it has taken steps to provide limited services to nonmember cities to discourage them from joining other agencies or creating their own. \nAttitudes about transit have shifted Arlington in the past decade as the city draws more employment centers, said Michael Morris, transportation director for the North Central Texas Council of Governments. \n\"They very much understand they're late to the dance,\" said Morris, who works and lives in Arlington. \nOne potential transit opportunity under review is a high-speed rail line between Fort Worth and Dallas that would tie into a privately funded line between Dallas and Houston. Morris said the goal is to get federal funds to pay for the project. \nBut for Arlington to get access to that line, it will need a rail connection between a high-speed rail station and DFW International Airport, Morris said. \n\"If Arlington isn't participating with one of the transportation authorities, I can't imagine there being a high-speed rail station in Arlington,\" Morris said. \"That has significant implications to the region. That obviously will affect the ridership on a high-speed rail line if we get two stations instead of three.\" The MAX bus line route City of Arlington MAX bus line by the numbers \nStops: Three \nRidership: 275 to 300 passenger trips per day \n2017 projected revenue: $730,257 \nSOURCES: DART, city of Arlington View Comments",

    "text": "Topics: Barack Obama , Donald Trump , Elections 2016 , President Trump , Race , Racism , Elections News , Politics News (Credit: Getty/Salon) \nSince Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the presidential election, one number grasped onto by many pundits is that 298 American counties carried twice by Obama flipped to Trump this year. Some have asked how these voters can be motivated by racism, if they voted for a black man twice? Others have wondered how they could not be, given the intensely racialized campaign that Trump ran. There is increasingly strong evidence, however, that in many of these counties the change was mainly the composition of the electorate. Black, Latino and working-class voters who backed Obama stayed home, and white Trump supporters came to the polls en masse. \nA New York Times analysis of YouGov data finds : “For every one voter nationwide who reported having voted for Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016, at least five people voted for Trump after not having voted four years ago. Clinton attracted substantially fewer 2012 nonvoters, the data show.” YouGov data suggest that only 7 percent of Obama voters flipped to support Trump, and the real number could be even less. Though these individuals make up a small share of Trump voters, they have drawn extensive attention. It should be noted that my analysis is not definitive. There is still much more evidence to come, and the major post-election surveys have not yet been released. The data sources I’m working with have small samples. There is enough evidence, however, to reject the idea that racism was not central to Trump’s appeal simply because some of his voters had previously voted for Obama. \nThe Policy Attitudes of Trump-to-Obama Voters \nYouGov, a market-research and polling firm, provided me with data comparing Obama voters who went with Clinton this year to Obama voters who ended up voting for Trump. As the data show, these voters are quite similar to Trump on policy attitudes, particularly his signature issues like trade and immigration, though they were also sympathetic to progressive reforms like higher minimum wages and free college tuition. Only 35 percent of former Obama voters who went for Trump believe immigrants should be able to stay in the country and apply for citizenship, compared with 78 percent of Obama voters who support Clinton. However, Trump supporters support free college (48 percent in favor, 39 percent opposed and the rest were “not sure”) and a higher minimum wage (52 percent in favor, 37 percent opposed). \nWe know from research, however, that policy preferences can flow from partisan identity rather than the other way around. That is, it may be that Trump supporters dislike NAFTA because they support Donald Trump, who opposes NAFTA. To solve this, I turned to the ANES 2016, which has the advantage of being performed early in the election cycle (January 2016), when it was far from clear that Trump would be the Republican nominee. Even at this early date, racial resentment strongly predicted how former Obama voters felt about Trump. \nI examined racial resentment, measured by questions like, “ Irish, Italian, Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up. Black people should do the same without any special favors.” (Here is an earlier extensive discussion of racial resentment . ) The mean racial-resentment score among former Obama voters who favored Trump was dramatically higher than among those who favored Clinton. Among white Obama voters who supported Clinton over Trump, 43 percent said it was “not at all likely” that many whites are unable to find jobs because minorities are taking them, compared to 17 percent of Obama voters who supported Trump. \nThat is, the voters who voted for Obama and then converted to Trump did indeed express high levels of racial resentment, high enough to be statistically significant in a model that controlled for party, ideology, education, age, gender, income, views on economic performance, racial resentment and views on trade. (This is also true using different measures of support for Trump and Obama). The charts below shows predicted “feeling thermometer” scores for Trump among Obama supporters, by racial resentment, views on the economy and support for free trade. Another shows that attitudes about white jobs affected Trump support (the question was only asked of white respondents). Simply because an individual voted for Obama in the past does not mean racial resentment didn’t influence their views on Trump. \nIt’s the Mobilization, Stupid \nWhat should Democrats take away from this election? The focus on voters who shifted from Obama to Trump is a distraction. They are certainly important, but Trump was far more effective at getting non-voters and lapsed voters out than he was at converting Obama voters. Those he did convert seem to be disproportionately conservative, and attracted to his message of white-exclusive populism. But the solution is not for Democrats to abandon “identity politics,” a sneaky term for its commitment to racial justice, gender equality, LGBTQ rights and inclusivity. Rather, Democrats must put forward their own populist agenda, one that addresses the real causes for stagnant wages ( financialization, weaker unions, lower minimum wages, slack labor markets ) rather than scapegoating immigrants and people of color. During the campaign, Hillary Clinton could and should have spent more time in the Rust Belt discussing auto bailouts, minimum wages and the rigged economy. \nBut there’s another aspect to consider. A recent New York Times piece on non-voters in Milwaukee quoted one resident as saying , “Milwaukee is tired. Both of them were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway.” This may sound strange for people knowledgeable about Obama’s policy agenda, but in some cases, Democrats actually intended to reduce the political impact of their policies. A perfect case comes from Michael Grunwald’s reporting on an $800 per worker tax cut included in Obama’s stimulus package: \n[Obama’s] economists wanted to dribble out the cash to recipients a few dollars a week in their paychecks, because studies showed they would be less likely to spend the windfall if they realized they were getting it. His political advisers argued that it would be insanity to conceal middle-class tax cuts rather than send Americans fat envelopes with Obama’s name on them. But Obama sided with his policy team, and later surveys showed that less than 10 percent of the public had any clue he had cut their taxes. \nIn other cases, the Democratic failure is more nefarious, as when Obama abandoned his promise to prevent 3 to 4 million homeowners from falling into foreclosure. This not only cost the administration an important victory for the middle class, it means that Democrats struggled to target and mobilize black and Latino supporters who had lost their houses . After an election decided by a few hundred thousand votes spread across a handful of states, it’s hard not to wonder if saving 4 million homeowners from foreclosure could have influenced the outcome. \nDemocrats practice policy, not politics. Programs like Obamacare are wonk-approved, but pay insufficient attention to mobilizing beneficiaries as citizens and constituents.When Democrats controlled the presidency and Congress, they downplayed voting rights. Though organized labor is the only bastion of working-class organizing, Obama failed to pursue measures that would have have aided labor organizing.My organization, Demos, was one of many to argue that the Obama administration made insufficient efforts to register voters using the healthcare exchanges. Republicans may imagine that Democrats provide people of color with endless benefits and use those benefits to mobilize voters, but in reality Democrats have entirely failed to do this. As I’ve shown previously, many whites (particularly Republicans) have a distorted view of government, believing it benefits people of color when benefits actually accrue slightly disproportionately to whites. \nWhen Republicans take power, their first priorities are voter suppression and right-to-work, their second is to destroy the capacity of government to aid working families and their third is to turn the government into a patronage machine for wealthy whites. Democrats have failed to understand that in order to win, they must do the opposite. Voting rights must be a priority, and policies should strengthen the ability of working people to organize and mobilize. \nGovernment capacity should be bolstered, creating both effective governance and public-sector jobs. Making post offices, DMVs and other government agencies function well is not sexy, but research shows that it can increase positive views of government, which increases support for services . Americans believe that government only works for elites and the wealthy, and the solution is to make government work better for average citizens. Policymaking should center on the direct provision of government services in a way that can help activists organize defined constituencies. \nPursuing policy in this way has political tradeoffs. A more mobilized and organized working class might well make political demands that the Democratic Party is not eager to pursue, due to ideology or fealty to donors. (Grassroots organizers on the right have repeatedly made such demands on the Republican Party.) In addition, these policies might fail to meet the wonkish ideal. It is likely true that a higher minimum wage is not be the economically optimal way to aid the working class. But because other solutions are obscured by the submerged state, they are more politically vulnerable. \nSimilarly, voters may prefer direct rent control and rent regulation rather tweaks to zoning regulations. It may be true that small stimulus checks spread over a period of time will benefit households more than one large check, but if this unseen stimulus leads voters to feel comfortable voting for a Republican, the end result is even less stimulus. Giving workers, unions, activists, organizers, immigrants’ rights groups, #BlackLivesMatter and other groups a seat at the table is necessary for Democrats to be electorally successful — and, given how weak the Democratic bench is, to foster future political talent. Party elites will have to cede some power to make this happen. \nConclusion \nThe feverish debates over race and class or “identity politics” are going nowhere, because they are grounded in a bad-faith online culture and fueled by personal grudges rather than concerns about actual organizing and politics. The new working class is racially diverse and gender-diverse, but it is also demobilized. The mobilizing institutions upon which Democrats have so long depended on have been crushed, and Democrats either sat on the sidelines while they were crushed or actively aided in their destruction . Electoral reforms around voting, districting and registration, along with investments in long-term organizing and policy design aimed creating mobilized, engaged constituencies and inclusive economic populism are the only possible path forward for a successful Democratic Party.

    "text": "By Gurcharan Das \n\nAfter almost three weeks of demonetisation , there is visible pain in the lives of ordinary people, a noticeable slowdown in economic activity, and reports of job losses in many sectors. The economy may contract by as much as two percentage points over the next two quarters — a colossal loss in national wealth. However, there can be no rollback. The gains from a cleaner, whiter economy are far bigger in the long run. Here’s how Narendra Modi can save demonetisation. \n\n1) Speed is of essence: Don’t depend only on our own printing presses to replenish the cash; subcontract the currency presses of friendly governments whose security levels are unimpeachable. Fly in the new notes and flood the system. The priority is to restore liquidity in the market so people can get on with their lives. \n\n2) Extend the income disclosure scheme: True, the last amnesty scheme was only a modest success, but after the stick recently wielded by Modi, a little carrot might work better now. Demonetisation has given rise to new currency brokers who are converting the old notes at 30 to 40% discount. Since government is threatening more action against black money such as scrutiny of benami land titles, people will be more inclined to convert their black to white via an amnesty scheme — say at a 50% tax rate rather than the 60% it is considering — rather than convert old black money to new black money via a broker. \n\nSome may opt to disclose their black money as 'current income' and get away by legally paying around 35% tax; this too should be welcomed. Another alternative is to offer low-yielding, long-term bonds that would convert black to white; the government would gain by getting money cheaply. The purpose is to diminish the fear in the most productive groups in society that create most of the jobs. Don’t demonise them: this is not a dharmayuddha. The objective is to change old, ingrained habits for the betterment of society. \n\n3) End harassment: Law-abiding citizens will happily pay tax if they believe they will be respectfully treated by income-tax officials. People need to be reassured that they can file returns online today; pay tax online; and get refund online. The computer decides, not the ITO, which returns are to be scrutinized. Modi needs to mount a major campaign to reassure people about this reduction in official discretion. He needs to also severely punish any tax official caught harassing a taxpayer. \n\n4) Put black to use: Offer a significant fiscal stimulus to the economy from the notes not likely to be exchanged, black money that will disappear forever. Spending this non-inflationary money — an estimated Rs 3 lakh crore — on infrastructure and housing can create masses of jobs and mitigate some of the jobs lost in demonetisation. \n\n5) Focus on real estate: Demonetisation will not stop the corruption that creates black money. For this you have to attack its underlying sources. In real estate, every step is mired in corruption — from buying land to getting approvals. Black money is also the result of excessive stamp duty. For this reason, Vijay Kelkar had recommended merging stamp duty into GST in his pioneering report on GST. That may be too late but we must keeping fighting for sensible taxes and clean titles in land. \n\n6) Roll back the customs duty on gold: Smuggling of gold declined in India when import restrictions were lifted after 1991. A decent white business developed in gold and jewellery. In 2013, there was a setback when customs duty on gold was reintroduced. Cash payments became common again because smuggled gold was cheaper. \n\n7) Reform the silly curbs on legitimate election donations to candidates: This has led to the use of black money in elections. I do not favour state funding, where my hard-earned taxes would finance candidates and family dynasties I despise. Instead we should follow the best practices in the US and Europe in funding elections. \n\n8) Reform the bureaucracy: Black money is generated because of administrative discretion. A good place to begin reform is to implement Justice Srikrishna's draft Indian Financial Code. \n\n9) Do not attempt to end black money: People should not break the law but we should overlook small transgressions, just like we ignore pedestrians who cross on a red light. Cash lubricates the system and a cashless society is the road to dictatorship. \n\n10) Don't touch the aam aadmi's tender: Finally, the next time you want to demonetise, flood the market first with 5,000 and 10,000-rupee notes; once the black money has moved up to these higher notes, demonetise only the Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 notes. Spare the aam aadmi.  ",

    "text": "Could MDMA, the powerful and illegal drug that often shows up in the nightclub scene and is known by the street name “ecstasy,” help people who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder? \nThe FDA apparently thinks it’s at least a possibility. \nAfter successfully testing the drug in preliminary trials, the FDA has decided to move forward on large-scale trials with PTSD patients who will take the strong drug to combat their PTSD symptoms, according to the New York Times . \nIt looks like it might be time for the fight over marijuana legalization, which has made major progress in the last couple years, to take the back seat. If these trials are successful, ecstasy could be available for medicinal use as early as 2021. \nThe upcoming trials, which reportedly include 230 patients, will be sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. The organization has previously studied the drug’s impact on veterans, sexual assault victims and first responders suffering from PTSD. \n“We can sometimes see this kind of remarkable improvement in traditional psychotherapy, but it can take years, if it happens at all,” researcher Michael Mithoefer told the Times. “We think it works as a catalyst that speeds the natural healing process.” \nRachel Hope, a PTSD patient who has taken MDMA, participated in a 2012 study and said the ecstasy helped her recall and confront the sexual abuse she experienced as a child. \n“It allowed me to rewire my brain,” she said. \nBut according to the Times, some medical professionals have major concerns about adding the drug to doctors’ arsenal of tools to deal with PTSD. Charles Marmar, head of psychiatry at New York University’s Langone School of Medicine, said ecstasy is a “feel-good drug” that could cause addiction problems and could ultimately “lead to serious damage to the brain.” \n“High doses of MDMA can affect the body’s ability to regulate temperature. This can lead to a spike in body temperature that can occasionally result in liver, kidney, or heart failure or even death,” a statement from the National Institute on Drug Abuse concluded.",

More than 234,000 residents have so far used the system.\nThe process helps travellers beat long queues and does away with the need for immigration stamps on passport pages.\n“With a transaction time that averages 10-15 seconds this is clearly a smarter way to travel,” said Paul Griffiths, the chief of Dubai Airports.\n“It speeds up the immigration process significantly and shortens queues. Our focus going forward is to get more residents using it.”\nThe system also “responds to calls from our leadership to provide services that make the passenger journey as smooth as possible,” said General Mohammad Al Merri, Director-General of the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs.\nFor the operator, automated smart gates help smooth the service and boost capacity. Dubai Airports plans to handle 118 million travellers by 2023.\nLast year, the airport saw more than 77 million travellers pass through, making it the world’s busiest in terms of international passenger traffic.\nAutomated immigration gates were first introduced at Dubai Airport in 2002.\nResidents must be 18 years old to use their Emirates ID cards at the immigration gates.\nFamilies travelling with children below the age of 18 can approach the manned counter next to the smart gates to complete the immigration process.",

    "text": "Analysts have called for Australia’s $100 banknote to be scrapped to improve transparency in the economy.\nThe green note, featuring soprano Dame Nellie Melba and military commander Sir John Monash, is used relatively infrequently in the general economy. But there are nearly 330m of them in circulation – almost three times the number of $5 notes.\nThe Australian Financial Review reported on Monday that HSBC had backed a UBS report suggesting the removal of high-denomination banknotes from circulation. In a report published earlier this month, UBS said Australia could remove larger-denomination notes because of increasing reliance on digital transactions.\nNew $5 banknote launches to mark National Wattle Day Read more \n“We believe removing large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks,” the report said.\nThe benefits could include reduced crime, increased tax revenue with fewer cash transactions and reduced welfare fraud. \nAustralia’s $50 and $100 notes make up 93% of all currency by value , though data from the Reserve Bank suggests the use of cash for transactions is falling. ATM transactions have decreased by 3.4% per annum since 2009, while credit card transactions are growing at 7.3%.\nSimon Babbage, the head of payments at HSBC Australia, told the AFR removing denominations would be a “good thing” if it increased transparency.\nA spokeswoman for the Commonwealth Bank said it did not have a position on removing the $100 note, but less than 3% of the machines in its ATM network dispensed $100 bills. Those were placed in high-demand areas such as airports. \nEarlier this month India suddenly withdrew from circulation its highest-value banknotes . \nThe prime minister, Narendra Modi, ordered the removal of 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes in a bid to shut down the booming economy of untaxed cash transactions. Modi told the nation the change would protect the interests of “those citizens earning honestly and with hard work”.\nBut the ban caused widespread disruption, forcing millions of people to queue outside banks to change small amounts of old money for legal tender, and Modi was accused of seeking to boost his party’s chances in a key state election next year.",

She was not required to attend. \nOutside the courtroom, defense attorney Tom Mesereau said Mathers \"very much regrets\" what happened. \n\"She apologized for her behavior and we're looking forward to resolving this case in a very fair manner,\" he said. \nThe 29-year-old Mathers faced widespread criticism after she shared the photo on Snapchat in July with the caption: \"If I can't unsee this then you can't either.\" She later apologized and deleted her social media accounts. Playboy Playmate Dani Mathers had admitted she posted this mocking photo on Snapchat in July. (Dani Matthews via Snapchat) \nThe gym, LA Fitness, reported the posting to police and revoked Mathers' membership. \nIf convicted, Mathers could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. A pretrial hearing was set for Dec. 21. \nDetectives began investigating after the LAPD received a report of \"illegal distribution\" of the image, police Capt. Andrew Neiman said after the photo became public. \nPlayboy Playmate Dani Mathers could face jail time for gym photo \n\"Her behavior is appalling and puts every member at risk of losing their privacy,\" Jill Greuling, an LA Fitness executive vice president, said at the time. Mathers, shown at a convention in Anaheim, Calif., in January, pleaded not guilty Monday to a misdemeanor count of invasion of privacy. (Daniel Knighton/FilmMagic) \nThe person in the photo was identified only by her age and it was not clear if she knew she was being photographed. \nMathers said in July that she accidentally posted the photo publicly. \n\"That was absolutely wrong and not what I meant to do,\" she said in an online video. \"I know that body-shaming is wrong. That is not the type of person I am.\" \nMathers was Playboy's Miss May in 2014. Tags:",

    "text": "37s ago • 1 min read \nYou know, you could wait until Thursday ... but why do that when you can indulge in some Tiger Woods full swings on Wednesday before the Hero World Challenge pro-am? This is the best footage we have had of Woods hitting shots since the 2016 Wyndham Championship, which happened nearly 16 months ago. \nThat driver (and his woods) will apparently be TaylorMade this week, too, as Woods transitions away from Nike sticks. Pretty solid position at the top. 👌🏻 https://t.co/zO3Fa1dorC — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) November 30, 2016 The swing we've all been waiting for ... https://t.co/IayDADea5y — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) November 30, 2016 Tiger Woods hit the range on Wednesday. And it was great to see. https://t.co/RJoazYkSuC — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) November 30, 2016 \nThis was unfathomable 12 months ago when Woods was hobbling around at this very tournament. \n\"You asked me last year how I was doing,\" said Woods on Tuesday. \"Not being able to get out of bed, not being able to move, how can I expect to come out here and swing a golf club at 120 miles an hour and be ballistic when I can't even get out of bed.\" \nNow, he's preparing to win it . There are (and will be) issues, though. Tiger said on Tuesday that foremost among them might be his distance control given that he hasn't played a competitive tournament in forever. \n\"I would say probably the most concerned is trying to get a feel for the distance,\" said Woods. \"I haven't had adrenaline in my system in a while and having that surge of adrenaline through my system, how much further is this ball going to be going. \n\"I know it generally is a half a club, but is it going to be more than that because I haven't played or is it going to be less than that or be about that? That part, I've always been ‑‑ throughout my career I've been pretty good at hitting the ball pin high. I'm more ‑‑ I'm concerned about that, what my body's going to be feeling, the energy, the surge of adrenaline going through my system.\" \nIt should be fascinating to watch starting on Thursday , and it sounds like Tiger is playing pretty well through the first seven holes of the pro-am as well. Not exactly 100% dialed in, but -1 through 7. An eagle, a three-putt and a couple par saves. https://t.co/ehVCd7Oakz",

    "text": "According to Amazon, the future of online shopping is… retail stores. \nThanks to the internet, everything we need – and everything we don't – is just a click away. And that is due largely to Amazon, which has steadily extended its reach across the web, becoming a one-stop shop for everything from books to groceries, novelty gadgets and clothes for your pet, often at a discounted rate. \nBut after over a decade of digital, we have reached a tipping point. Indeed, where brands clamoured to the web a decade ago, now we're seeing online stores migrating out into the world. And when the world's biggest online retailer starts opening brick-and-mortar stores, it's a strong signal that trends are changing. \nOnline shopping or traditional brick-and-mortar stores? In its early days as an online bookseller, Amazon put little mom-and-pop book shops out of business, selling books at prices with which independent retailers couldn't compete. But now, they're moving into your neighbourhood with their own stores. \nPiloting their new venture in Seattle, the oligarch of online retail has since opened stores in Portland and San Diego, with plans to open more bookstores in the coming year. It also plans to open a chain of convenience stores, as reported in the Wall Street Journal last month, where consumers who have selected their groceries online can pick them up on the drive home from work.\nFrom the outside, Amazon's new stores don't appear all that different from Indigo other big book retailers. But don't let the appearance fool you: this is not a quaint and cozy book shop, but rather, a website come to life, where stores are designed to mimic the online shopping experience. \nReal-life website To make it onto store shelves, books need to have earned at least four stars in Amazon's online rating system. Those ratings are displayed prominently below each book, as Nicholas Carr of the MIT Technology Review reports , along with a snippet from an online customer review. Amazon has even incorporated its famous \"recommendation engine\" into the store layout, with displays that read, \"If you like this, you'll love this.\"\nBasically, stepping foot inside the Amazon bookstore is like walking into a 3D version of the website. This isn't just retail; this is Offline 2.0. \nThe question is, why is Amazon doing this? Up to now, it has been able to dominate the market by undercutting traditional retailers; Amazon's model involves a combination of low overhead and high volume, which lets it sell items at a lower price than independent stores. So why opt now for the additional cost of rent, cashiers and salespeople?\nAmazon is in the data-collection business. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty)\nThe answer: Amazon is in the business of data. They are a convenience engine, powered by people's purchases and online browsing. There's a strong argument to be made that Amazon's motivation for moving into malls is a data play — a move to track customers in the physical world, the way it's able to online. \nAnd with all of that data at their disposal, you can be sure their \" IRL \" expansion also reflects changing consumer trends. Amazon knows what users want, and users want more than just a quick and cheap transaction.\nPeople like paper The dwindling interest in e-books is evidence of that. According to the Association of American Publishers, e-book revenues dropped 11 per cent in 2015, but plain old fashioned books are doing just fine. In fact, sales in bookstores grew 6.1 per cent, proving  that price and convenience aren't the only factors in people's decision making when it comes to buying books. It turns out, the e-reader promise of being able to carry a whole library of books in your purse just isn't as appealing as industry enthusiasts had hoped. People like paper, and they like being able to show off a shelf full of the books they've read. \nThough other internet brands are likewise trying to expand their presence offline — Warby Parker, Rent the Runway, Bonobo and Frank and Oak have all opened up physical shops — Amazon is the one to watch. That the most powerful retail data engine in the world has, based on its data, decided to open up stores signals we might be at the start of a larger trend, where to be novel or unique, brands are moving away from the internet, and towards the latest sensation… your local mall.\nSo just watch: even if you're doing all of your shopping online this holiday season, soon you'll miss the annoying Christmas music, the smell of cinnamon and all the twinkly lights. The good news is, the real world is the latest hot new thing, and it's just around the corner. \n\nThis column is an opinion - for more information about our commentary section please read this  editor's blog  and  our FAQ .",

    "text": "AnnaKoppelman \nCrush City is a biweekly column following the romantic misadventures of New York City high school junior Anna Koppelman. Her conquests include studying her crush in geometry instead of isosceles triangles and making a secret Pinterest board for the wedding she is definitely going to have with her older brother’s friend. Anna may not be talking to any of her exes, but she’s happy to write about them. \nWhen you first break up, you mix your regret into chocolate icing and eat it straight out of the Betty Crocker can. You regret all of it. Liking him, kissing him, the month you spent tired, getting half the amount of sleep because you were busy texting him. Then your best friend will call him an asshole or a loser. She’ll point to the fact that he only wore plaid and that his favorite show is still SpongeBob . You will take your last bite of icing, pick the popcorn kernels out of your hair, and tell yourself you are smarter, funnier, hotter, and altogether better than him. You regret ever dating him, as you find yourself at the gym, slowly picking up the pace of your run. \nAnd then, you will find yourself with nothing to do but watch reruns of The Mindy Project on a Friday night, alone with your own thoughts. And then, you will regret everything you did. The fact that you didn’t tell him about your gluten allergy, scared he would make fun of you; you ate a doughnut and left the date early, because, well, you have a gluten allergy. You hold on to regret because it’s the only thing you have to hold on to. It’s the proof. You regret so you can remember watching him as he drove down the highway, the glasses he only wore in his car. So you can remember that you did happen, that you were real, there for a second, that you didn't laugh once while watching your favorite comedy special because you were too busy making out to listen to it. You regret so you don’t have to say goodbye. It’s an unchangeable fate — always there. You regret because that is all you have left. \nI used to want my misery to be sexy. Smoking a cigarette out a car window. Over-rimmed black eyeliner. Hooking up drunk while listening to R.E.M. Ripped jeans. Fingernails painted navy. \nBut I was never fun dark. I was sad dark. The kind of sad where you can only listen to happy music, hoping the loud beat and high-pitched voice will rub off on you, and to enough love songs to fill the void. I was the kind of dark where you feel everything in hyperfocus — skin paper thin, eyes sullen. I walked through life sweating, worried, attempting to find the loophole to shorten the days. I was dark in the least glorious way. \nAnd then I began writing about it. I wrote a poem and titled it “trapped.” It was about this feeling I would get whenever I walked into school: these chest palpitations. I felt like I couldn’t escape the pain and the dark; I felt trapped. Trapped — the word I would repeat, again and again. I wrote an essay about bullying and the anxiety that followed. I became queen of my own darkness. How gruesome it looked from the inside. \nWhen you first publish an article there is a feeling in your stomach — a victory, almost. You have just gotten vengeance. The kid who called you a cow no longer has power because you wrote about it. All wrongs done right. You feel free, flying, no strings. Like you have won. \nAnd then a few months go by and one night you have nothing better to do but read your old writing and you get this feeling in your stomach. Like other people will know how sad you were then. How were you that sad then? Were you ever really that sad? Your mind erases things after you type them, like you no longer have to remember until you do. Convincing yourself the pain never happened makes it easier to ignore the scars. And then you remember that the pain did happen. You know it did. The evidence is right there in front of you, blinking on your computer screen. Blinking for others to see. \nYou calm yourself down. Who cares if some kids will read about the darkness and laugh at you? They already laugh at you. But then there is a boy you like, and you tell him about your writing. He googles you. You aren’t the fun kind of sexy dark, and he knows it. It scares him. He keeps his gloved hands as far away from you as he can. \nSo you try to stop writing about the darkness. In fact, you don’t write at all. Let weeks sprawl out on wordless pages. Life curls in on itself. You smile. No one questions the authenticity; it’s about survival. And then you meet him, at a camp dance, in red plaid, a doughy grin. \nI always wanted to play mini-golf, and we did. It was warm and overpriced. His arms fit around me as he guided me through a putt, his head close enough to my shoulder for me to turn and kiss. I wore a short skirt, a black tank top tucked in. I had a white button-down shirt opened loose around my shoulders. Pop music blasted around us. I looked at him as he went to pick up the ball before we moved to the next hole. He looked so perfect standing there. His curly hair, which his mom kept insisting he needed to cut, was growing free — he pushed back the end with his hand when he saw me looking at him. There was so much want in that moment, so much hope answered. We were mini-golfing, like I always wanted, his rough hands there to clasp around mine, his lips there for me to touch, his heart there, beating. I stood, still looking at him, and smiled. He laughed and motioned for me to follow him, so I did. \nThe other day I was watching Shark Tank , and this guy pitched an idea about sunscreen scanners. At first, it seemed like a good idea, and he gave it a high valuation — like 10 percent for $50k, or something. I forget the details, but he talked a lot about all of his degrees. And then the sharks asked him what the sales on the products were, and he said, “Well, they are just a prototype, so I don’t know yet.” The sharks asked him what he based his high evaluation off of, and he said, “Well, I can feel the potential.” \nThere is always so much of that potential before you take a chance, and always so much wasted looking back, so much more to rehash when you sift back through the memories. It’s the what-could-have-been. It’s the fact that you never told him about your gluten allergy. For all the deep questions you asked, you kept everything on the surface. The right memory tinged with regret finds its way back to potential. \nYou have met girls who are sexy in their sadness: A part of you still wants to be them. But you have worked hard not to be the girl hyperventilating on the floor of her kitchen, hiccuping on her own breath, taking so much in that she can’t let it out. Dark has fallen behind the other parts of you. You still do not know how to write without regret. It is the only way to backpedal through all this mud. \nWant to be an MTV Founders contributor?

The probe has put under scanner at least 87 contractors and officials who are part of city's waste management . \n\nHome Minister G Parameshwara's letter to the top cop on November 11 referred to the memorandum he received from the KSCSK, which detailed the alleged scam, and sought an inquiry by the \"COD [CID]or an independent agency\". \n\nIn his letter to the Home Minister, Narayana, a former president of the commission, talked about the alleged misuse of funds as well as the injustice done to workers. \n\nHe mentioned how, since 2005, salaries were being disbursed for pourakarmikas, but without all the components of employer's contribution towards insurance and PF. \"Employee's contribution to ESI [insurance] of 1.75 per cent, and employer's contribution of 4.75 per cent should have been credited to their insurance accounts. But these funds have not been credited,\" said Narayana. Contractors have cheated the workers out of at least Rs384 crore, he alleged. With no ESI coverage, the pourakarmikas have lost over Rs15 lakh coverage, he said. \n\n\"The BBMP is paying salaries to over 19,000 workers. But, as per our survey, only 12,400 are into cleaning activities. Bogus documents have been created for the remaining 6,600 'employees' and salaries are being paid to them for over 10 years,\" he said. \n\n\"A CID inquiry has been sought into the issue,\" a senior home ministry source told Mirror.",

(Photo by Lars Baron/Getty Images) By Samuel Reiman Nov 28, 2016 at 1:08p ET 0Shares \nHeading into Sunday’s F1 finale, Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton knew that a lot of things would have to fall his way if he was going to win the World Championship. \nHamilton would have had to have outscored his teammate Nico Rosberg by 12 points, which meant that, even if he won, Hamilton would not be champion unless Rosberg finished fourth or worse. \nIn the closing laps of Sunday’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, it looked like Hamilton was set to finish ahead of Rosberg in another Mercedes 1-2, but the Red Bull of Max Verstappen and the Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel weren’t too far behind. \nSubsequently, Hamilton started to drive slow, allowing Verstappen and Vettel to catch. However, neither were able to make a move, and Hamilton crossed the line ahead of Rosberg then Vettel and Verstappen, all of which were separated by 1.7 seconds. \nBut the question remains, with Hamilton risking losing a 1-2 finish for the team by allowing rival cars to catch his teammate from behind, did he do anything wrong? 0",

(David Wexler/For New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday, November 21, 2016, 10:01 PM \nFive emaciated dogs are recovering after being rescued from a house of horrors on Long Island where youngsters played near a dead pooch left chained to a tree, officials said Monday. \nIn a bizarre scene, the dogs’ owner barbecued hamburgers while animal rescuers removed the dead and starving pups from the Wyandanch home on Saturday. \nVeleda Bailey, 35, was charged with animal cruelty by the Suffolk County SPCA, after admitting she hadn’t fed the dogs in over a week, officials said. \n“It was sheer indifference,” Suffolk County SPCA Chief Roy Gross said Monday at a press conference at the Babylon Animal Shelter, where the rescued animals are being treated. “These animals are just loving creatures who want affection. How can you do that to an animal?\" \nVolunteers from the rescue group Almost Home, who help low-income pet owners with food and veterinary services, were visiting homes in the neighborhood Saturday when they saw a female pit bull mix on the street.

Another male dog, just skin and bones, sat nearby. \n“The barbecue was going, it was like a Fourth of July afternoon,” said Linda Klampfl of Almost Home. “A little boy made a comment that he thought it was funny the dead dog had no more eyes. \nIf convicted, Bailey faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.

Howard Brookins (21st) by Chicago's rodent community just weeks after he gave a fiery City Council speech decrying the menace of \"aggressive squirrels.\"\nOut cycling on the Cal Sag trail on Nov. 13, Brookins was jumped by a kamikaze squirrel that leapt into the front wheel of Brookins' bike and lodged himself in the spokes, sending Brookins flying over the handlebars.\nThe attack cost the squirrel its life, but left Brookins needing surgery on a broken nose, fractured skull and five or six teeth that were knocked out in the accident.\nBut Brookins, who got out of hospital on Thursday and posted a photo of his mangled bike with the squirrel trapped in the wheel, can see the funny side.\n\"I can think of no other reason for this squirrel's actions than that it was like a suicide bomber, getting revenge,\" he said Monday as he began what his doctors have told him will be a months-long recovery including further surgeries.\nThe squirrel's attack was silent and caught Brookins completely unaware, he said.\n\"Some lady came along the trail and found me lying there next to my bicycle and called 911,\" he said. \"I only saw the squirrel when I came to and saw it stuck in the wheel.\"\nBrookins in October railed against super-sized squirrels who he said were munching through city garbage cans, calling for a crackdown.\nBut any follow up action he plans to take will have to wait. His recovery means he will be unable to attend events for some time, he said.\nHe added on Monday that the incident was probably the closest he has ever come to death and that he is thankful because \"I could have broken my neck.\"\nIf any squirrels visit his home in the coming weeks, he said, \"I'm calling animal control!\"\nkjanssen@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @kimjnews\n  Howard Brookins",

In few days you'll know' – Khabib Nurmagomedov Published time: 21 Nov, 2016 20:51 Get short URL Russian MMA fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov / RT Top UFC lightweight Khabib 'The Eagle' Nurmagomedov, who has been calling for the championship belt fight ever since he recovered from injury earlier this year, says he now has a “plan B” if he doesn’t get it. \nNurmagomedov, who has a perfect 24-0 MMA record , showed a dominant performance against both of his opponents this year, including a third round submission victory against Michael Johnson at historic UFC 205 in New York City’s Madison Square Garden. \nBut taking into account the fact that UFC didn’t put Khabib on the main card at UFC 205 it's not hard to tell that the promotion is not too concerned about him fighting for the title yet. \nREAD MORE: Nurmagomedov destroys Johnson at UFC 205, demands fight with ‘chicken’ McGregor \nKhabib still found a way to deliver his message to UFC and his fans, speaking after his latest victory over Johnson. \n\"I want to stay humble but other guys talk too much,\" said Nurmagomedov in his post-fight interview in the octagon. \n\"Beginning of the year your guy tapped like chicken. End of the year he gets title fight. Crazy! \n“This is true. You know this. This is not trash talking. Irish only 6 million, Russia 150 million, I want to fight your chicken. What do you say about 24-win streak? Let's go, let's go with your chicken.\" \nThe video of his interview gained over 1,000,000 views on the official UFC YouTube profile alone. \nTalking to media at the post-fight press conference, UFC President Dana White also confirmed that he received Khabib’s message about the title shot, adding, “it’s a good problem to have.” \nBut The Eagle went further later, tweeting: “if I don't get my title shot next I have different plan I won't be fighting in UFC @danawhite.” I want to fight for @ufc title for respect but if I don't get my title shot next I have different plan I won't be fighting in UFC @danawhite — khabib nurmagomedov (@TeamKhabib) November 16, 2016 \nTalking to RT Sport exclusively, last Saturday Khabib said more about his “plan B”, clash with Conor McGregor and representing Russia in UFC. \nRT: What happened between you and McGregor at the UFC 205 weigh-in? \nKhabib Nurmagomedov: He was watching me. I said, ‘what? What do you want?’ Because I saw a video that morning [of him] talking bad to Tyron Woodley. And maybe he thinks I am Tyron Woodley. I told him I am different. I am not Eddie [Alvarez], I am not Tyron. I am different. And he didn’t say nothing. He just said, ‘what? What?’ I did let him know [that] I am gonna smash his face. He said, ‘We’ll see. We’ll see.’ That’s it. \nRT: When did it all begin between you and Conor? Is there any particular reason for your animosity? \nKN: Because he moved to my weight. That’s why he is my enemy. Sometimes I respect my opponent, this time no. ‘Conor is very popular, but if we talk fans I have more’ – @UFC ’s #Nurmagomedov (RT EXCLUSIVE VIDEO) https://t.co/jgJDotpUXf @TeamKhabib — RT Sport (@rtsportnews) November 21, 2016 \nRT: You have said on Twitter that you have a “different plan” in case UFC don't give you a title shot next. Could you tell us a little more about that plan? \nKN: I have a big plan, a big plan. But after a couple of days you guys will know. \nRT: Would you possibly want to move up in weight? \nKN: Maybe, but I think I'm truly a lightweight, I'm not a welterweight. But why not? First smash Conor McGregor, take lightweight title, then fight for the welterweight title. I like this idea. So maybe. \nRT: Tell us more about your famous ‘papakha’ headwear, that you wear before and after fights. What does it mean to you? Фото опубликовано Khabib Nurmagomedov (@khabib_nurmagomedov) Янв 20 2016 в 1:48 PST \nKN: It represents where I am from. My small hometown in Dagestan . This is traditional headgear for Dagestan, for Chechnya, for the Caucasus region. And it’s very important for me. Very important. \nRT: You represent Russia for UFC fans. Do you feel some sort of pressure, because you represent a big country? \nKN: Of course. Now I may be the best Russian fighter in UFC. In UFC everybody calls me Russian. They say, ‘that guy comes to arena wearing the Russian hat.’ I like it because Russia is 150 million [people]. I already said this after the fight [with Michael Johnson]. This is not a small country like Ireland. I have a very big fan base. And this is what I represent - Russian fans in UFC. I think Conor is a popular guy but if we talk about fans – I think I have more fans than him. If we have 6 million people in Ireland, what are we talking about? I have 150 million only in Russia. If we talk about Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Turkey. \nRT: But does it bring you any pressure? Read more Russian fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov threatens UFC exit if title shot doesn’t materialize \nKN: Sometimes I feel pressure because a lot of people follow me. And maybe there are a lot of people waiting for me to make a mistake so you have to stay careful. Because that is not the same when you are like 17 or 18. Now you are different. Now you are one of the best fighters in the world. One of the most famous – 28 years old. You are big guy. You have to be careful with a lot of stuff. So yeah I feel that pressure sometimes. \nRT: Do you think you religion helps you to stay focused and overcome that pressure? \nKN: I think that is the number one reason why I am a disciplined guy – this is my religion. This is not about being a professional athlete, so I have to do this or I have to do that. That is because I am Muslim. That’s why I stay focused. That’s why I stay disciplined. So that is not about sport. For me it is everything.",

    "text": "Tweet This 0 \nATHENS, Ga. -- A five-game stretch in the middle of Georgia’s season, one in which the Bulldogs went 1-4, left many in Bulldog nation wondering if the team had bought in to Kirby Smart and his vision for the program. \nSince that time the Bulldogs have gone 3-0 with wins over Kentucky, Auburn, and Louisiana-Lafayette, seemingly turning their season around. According to Smart, the fact that UGA’s seniors, those who were recruited by a different staff entirely, bought into the program right away is the biggest reason why the team has come around and started playing better of late. \n“The transition was great,” Smart said of his seniors. “They know that I have a lot of respect for Coach (Mark) Richt, and so do they. They were recruited by Coach Richt and his staff, so they understand that. They know that things like this in this business happen, and they respected our staff and our program to the ‘n’th degree. A lot of them have supported everything we have been about. They are the glue that held this team together during some of the adverse times.” \nSaturday will be the final time those seniors will ever don the red and black in Sanford Stadium. It’ll be a bittersweet time for those 11 players. (Photo: Jim Dedmon, USA TODAY Sports) \nSending those guys out on a high note has been the rallying cry for this team since a number of its goals were wiped off the table after the loss to Vanderbilt last month. Many of the sophomores and juniors who spoke with the media mentioned how they would continue to press on for the love of the game and for the Bulldogs finishing their final season in Athens. \nBut during that time it was the attitude and leadership of those veteran players that kept the wheels turning per their head coach. \n***Make sure you’re doing everything you can to keep up with the Georgia Bulldogs during the 2016 season -- take five seconds to Sign up for our FREE Bulldogs newsletter now!*** \n“I thought the number one thing that happened was the leadership group and the seniors took an attitude of being positive and the teachers in our organization -- strength staff, player development staff, training staff -- we hit everybody with, ‘be positive. It’s not the end of the world. We’re going to be ok. We’re going to bounce back from this.’ They helped sell that. So to see them react that way -- I think good kids respond well to adversity. We had some adversity and they responded well.” \nThe seniors can’t be credited with all of that. As Smart mentioned, the leadership group made up of players from every class also played a part. But the first-year head coach certainly seems willing to point the finger at those Bulldogs in their final year when it comes to helping this team go from 4-4 with a real possibility of not making a bowl to 7-4 with a chance to finish his first season with nine wins. \n“We just want them to go out on top, and that's what's important is that those guys have been really helpful to this team this year, this season,” Smart said of the seniors. \n***Want to have any and all information regarding Georgia Bulldogs athletics at your fingertips?

By Pooja Nayak | Published: November 21, 2016 6:40 pm comments \nThis morning we reported to you how Ajaz Khan was arrested for sending obscene pictures of his private parts to a woman. Turns out the lady had filed an FIR against Ajaz on November 15 claiming how he would not only send her objectionable pictures but would even abuse her through messages. While reports suggested that Ajaz was released on cash bail of Rs 10,000 this Sunday. The Bigg Boss fame actor FINALLY breaks his silence on what exactly went wrong and how someone was just trying to ruin his image…. \nIn interaction with DNA, Ajaz recalled to the unfortunate incident stating, “They called me to the police station through IT (Information, Technology) Act. They wanted me to surrender my phone which I had not done when I had been summoned the last time. I did so this time. They called me on Saturday evening thinking I wouldn’t be able to obtain bail on Sunday.But God is with me. Because the truth is with me. I went to police station at 4 pm on Saturday and I got bail at 9 am on Sunday.” Also read: Shocking! Ajaz Khan ARRESTED for sending obscene pictures of his private parts to a woman \nAjaz is not a bit guilty about the allegations thrashed at it him for he believes, “I am a man and a celebrity.That’s a dead combination. I want to warn all celebrities to be careful whom they connect with on Tinder, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram and other social networking sites. There are lots of strugglers out there who want to get famous by piling on and pulling down people more famous them. There are lots of stupid blackmailers out there. The government has given illimitable power to women, and they frequently misuse these powers.You’ve seen how girls out to get some publicity have ruined the careers of people in the entertainment world. Anyway, I did nothing wrong. That’s why I am out on bail. Otherwise the laws of the country favour women. No matter what their allegations and no matter how strong a man’s defence, women are favoured by the law. If I was even remotely guilty I’d be in jail right now. ” \nHowever, one cannot forget, a similar case was filed against Ajaz by an aspiring model earlier this year. Do you think his words are to be believed or is there more to what meets the eye? Tell us in the comments below and keep watching this space for more updates on this hot story.",

    "text": "Chris Bowen says a Labor government would require the Productivity Commission to produce five-yearly reports measuring equality of opportunity and social mobility, as part of a multi-pronged policy effort to ensure Australia can maintain a genuinely egalitarian tradition.\nThat work would be sequenced with the existing intergenerational reports produced by the Treasury, the shadow treasurer will say in a speech he is due to give to the Chifley Research Centre on Tuesday.\nBowen will argue that Australia regularly professes to be the land of the fair go but governments need to ensure the egalitarian “dream” has substance behind it.\nPeter Dutton points finger at Muslims of Lebanese background in immigration row Read more\n“We can’t let the well-earned achievements of some mask a cold, hard assessment of the situation in the broad,” he will say.\nOpportunity “gets a lot of lip service in the rhetoric of politicians”, Bowen’s speech says. “All political parties claim to believe that all Australians, regardless of their background or their parent’s wealth, can grow to their full potential,” he will say. “But is this actually the case?”\nThe shadow treasurer will argue governments taking practical steps to bring about equality of opportunity “is now more important than ever before” and he says the proposed data set would form the bedrock of a policy response ensuring that people are in a position to improve their circumstances over the course of a lifetime.\nBowen says Australia needs to “calmly and soberly” assess whether additional steps are needed to ensure the starting line is even. “You can’t improve something unless you have the data to measure your progress,” he will say in the speech.\nHe will point to work undertaken by Harvard economists Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren, who have found that social mobility in the US relates to the neighbourhoods people grow up in, and so social mobility should be tackled on a local level.\n“In my view, the five-yearly equality of opportunity report would become an important part of our national discourse and, in time, hopefully, an important document that no future Liberal government would dare abolish,” Bowen’s speech says.\n“Like productivity and economic growth statistics, this report would help enshrine equality of opportunity as a central focus in the national debate about Australia’s advancement and economic development.”\nBowen’s speech, to be delivered on Tuesday night, is one of a series of public interventions from the shadow treasurer making the case for an open economy and advocating policies of inclusive growth to bolster the middle class while promoting economic growth.\nDeveloper who paid for 'access' to One Nation calls for end to political donations Read more\nBrexit in the UK , the rise of One Nation in the federal election and the election of Donald Trump to the White House have kicked off political debates around the world as politicians attempt to grapple with the voter backlash against globalisation, trade liberalisation and so-called “establishment” politics.\nBowen will draw on some of his background in the speech, noting his discovery during first-year economics at Sydney University that he was the only person in his tutorial group from the western suburbs of Sydney and the only student from a comprehensive public high school.\nHe says it became “clearer to me then than ever before that, 20 years after Gough Whitlam’s attempts to open up universities for all, we still had a long way to go”.\nThe shadow treasurer will argue that equality of opportunity and social mobility have become more urgent concerns because of the underlying conditions sitting behind the current political backlash – principally that income inequality is rising around the world.\nHe will say it is fashionable in some quarters to concede that equality of opportunity is important but to argue that income equality is not.\nBowen says it is a mistake to argue it is important for governments to help people to get to the starting line but then not care about what happens in the race.\n“Put simply, the more unequal a society, the harder it will be for people to be mobile within it,” he will say. “Or, conversely, the less opportunity there is for people to reach their potential can make an unequal society even more unequal as those at the bottom of the socioeconomic class can’t even get to the starting line.”",

    "text": "Entrepreneurial Launch Code: Learn the Keys to Success By Joel Sussman, Business News Daily Contributor November 22, 2016 11:45 am EST MORE Credit: baranq/Shutterstock \nIf you asked 10 people what the word \"entrepreneur\" means, you'd probably get 10 different answers. Although business owners are often labeled entrepreneurs, not everyone who owns a business has an entrepreneurial mind-set or the qualities needed to make a business thrive. \nOne definition, which captures the essence of entrepreneurship, was developed by author John Hagel III, the founder and chairman of the Deloitte Center for the Edge, a Silicon Valley research center. From his perspective, an entrepreneur is not just someone who wants to make a bundle of money in the fastest possible way, but rather \"someone who sees an opportunity to create value and is willing to take a risk to capitalize on that opportunity,\" he wrote in a Harvard Business Review article . \nAmong the biggest mistakes many novice entrepreneurs make is attempting to reinvent the wheel. Fortunately, entrepreneurs can easily avoid that common stumbling block by following the advice of motivational speaker Tony Robbins. He said that one of the keys to success in business, especially for aspiring entrepreneurs, is to ask for help from a mentor who already knows the ropes. \n\"Whatever you want in life,\" Robbins said , \"someone has already discovered how to get it.\" \nRobbins said that a seasoned entrepreneur \"can likely save you time and pain with the knowledge they've gained in their own experiences.\" \nAs in all business relationships, it's often best to approach it from the standpoint of mutual benefits, he said. \"First, figure out how you can help them, add value to their life, and then they will be more likely to help you.\" Finding business coaches \nAccess to business mentors can help you avoid costly errors, overcome problems and take advantage of emerging opportunities. Fortunately, plenty of seasoned business owners and professionals are ready and willing to offer new entrepreneurs advice, guidance and coaching. If you don't know where to look, however, business mentors can be hard to find. \nEffective strategies for finding them can include taking entrepreneurial courses at a local college, attending seminars and signing up for continuing education programs. Organizations like the Chamber of Commerce also offer workshops conducted by qualified instructors and local business experts. \nFor example, the Albany, New York, Capital Region Chamber offers an intensive, 10-week \"Entrepreneurial Boot Camp.\" This 17-session course includes 10 hours of mentoring, assistance in applying for grants, ongoing help in writing a business plan and open discussions with panels of advisers, such as accountants, business lawyers, insurance professionals, marketing experts and loan officers. \nJanet Tanguay, the chamber's entrepreneurship manager, said some students have compared the 60 hours of instruction to a \"mini MBA program.\" From a mentoring standpoint, the semiannual course provides participants with access to approximately 55 instructors, most of whom are business professionals and established entrepreneurs. It also offers an opportunity to network with dozens of other students, which can generate new ideas, valuable business contacts and referrals, Tanguay said. Learning to adapt \nWhile a lot of factors contribute to success or failure of a new business, Tanguay said adaptability is one of the most important ingredients for business survival. \n\"The main things are adaptability and the ability to pivot when there's a problem,\" she said. If the economy changes, if your competition changes, [if there are] seasonality changes, [it's important] that they can adapt to whatever's going on. It's the people that stay 'status quo' and don't make those changes that have a hard time surviving.\" \nTanguay pointed out that when Blockbuster and Hollywood Video failed to update their business models a few years ago, services like Netflix and Redbox moved in and gained dominance in the home entertainment market. \nThe solution for people just starting out in business is to surround themselves with a strong support network. By working with mentors, other entrepreneurs and instructors, business owners can stay on track, identify obstacles in their paths and change course whenever necessary. \n\"We have clients coming out of dental school or massage school, and [while] they know their craft really well, they don't necessarily know about business,\" said Tanguay. Mentors can bridge that gap and help entrepreneurs navigate the challenges of running a business. \nSheilah Sable, the owner of an errand service called Call Sheilah! , found success after graduating from the Entrepreneurial Bootcamp. By working closely with her business mentors, she's established herself as a viable and growing business in the region. \n\"Being coached by a mentor has been one of the most instrumental influences in starting my business and achieving small steps towards success,\" Sable said. \"I am not someone who likes to be told what to do. But [I] also am aware that I do not know everything, especially in this area, so picking multiple individuals as mentors has been a great commitment. I committed to do almost everything they suggested, since they are the experts, and it has worked out well.\" Staying on the cutting edge \nWhile not everyone has the drive and focus to launch and operate a successful business, there is an abundance of educational, mentoring and training programs for those that do. With more than 300 schools offering entrepreneurship studies in the U.S., future business owners have a lot of options to choose from. \nIn its 10th annual survey, The Princeton Review named the 25 undergraduate and 25 graduate schools that demonstrate the most commitment to entrepreneurial studies. The survey considered factors like the percentage of faculty, students and alumni who are actively and successfully involved in entrepreneurial endeavors; the number and reach of mentorship programs, scholarships and grants for entrepreneurial studies; and the level of support for school-sponsored business-plan competitions. \nFor entrepreneurs who do not have access to collegiate business programs or Chamber of Commerce entrepreneurial boot camps, SCORE offers many workshops, webinars and free small business mentoring services. Last year, the organization's 11,000 volunteer mentors donated more than 2.2 million hours of their time to help entrepreneurs start businesses, acquire new skills and overcome obstacles to success. With more than 320 chapters throughout the U.S., the nonprofit association, supported by the U.S. Small Business Administration, has a presence in many communities. \nOne of the success stories featured on SCORE's website is that of a toy-lending business serving Austin, Texas. In addition to being a toy-lending library, Tobrary also serves as a play space and birthday party venue. Through SCORE, business owner Liza Wilson connected with Celia Bell, a local mentor, who guided Wilson through the steps of opening her business. \n\"Celia has helped me with everything,\" Wilson said, \"from marketing to pricing, interacting with clients, adding revenue streams and so much more.\" \nReady to start your business?

Dortmund's Twitter coverage of their goal-fest v Legia was as good as the game! \nAs a fan of the club who used to be on the terraces before the boardroom, Ayre is uniquely positioned to understand the club’s traditions and what it means to people but also that change has been vital to make them more competitive. \n‘I always describe it to people that it’s like looking after a Faberge egg. It’s worth a fortune and God help that you would ever break it or damage it. It’s like carrying it around in your pocket most days. And some days you might sit on it,’ Ayre told the Liverpool Echo .

    "text": "Fake hairless kitten won't lose tail \nRoland Lines, communications manager of the Alberta SPCA, said the initial report was from someone who no longer owned the cat. \n\"Our officer is now trying to interview the current owners, hopefully get access to some of the veterinary records because I believe some of the cats have been taken to see veterinarians,\" he said. \nLines said it may be difficult to track down the person selling the cats. But that person could be charged with causing an animal to be in distress, which carries a maximum fine of $20,000. Shayla Bastarache plays with Moofasa, left, and Nyla at her home. (Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press) \nThe possibility of fraud in these sales is outside the scope of the Animal Protection Act, the society said. \nLines said the alleged abuse of the animals was motivated by money. Sphynx cats typically sell for more than $1,000 each. \nLines advised people buying pets not to meet strangers in a dark parking lot. \n\"If you want to be sure you're not giving money to a criminal, I suggest you go to a humane society to adopt an animal,\" he said in a news release. \nPeople \"absolutely\" set on a breed and unable to wait for it to be available from an animal shelter should get the identity of the seller and see where the animal was raised, he said. Kittens for $650 \nShayla Bastarache had also come forward with a story of being scammed by an online vendor. \nBastarache owns two real sphynx — the latest she bought for $1,500. \nWhen she found a woman selling sphynx kittens for $650 each on Kijiji, she agreed to meet the seller in a gas station parking lot an hour north of Calgary. \nIn the dark, she exchanged cash for two of the cats — one for her and one for a friend. Bastarache named her kitten Moofasa. \nAbout two weeks later the kitten's hair grew back, and Bastarache realized the deal was a scam. \nWhile some of the buyers reported the scam to RCMP, they say they were told not much could be done without the seller's name. \nA cellphone number the seller supplied was no longer in service. Vlad was advertised as a hairless sphynx cat, but grew a coat of orange fur. (JoAnne Dyck) \nThe first woman to come forward about the scam was JoAnne Dyck. \nThe Red Deer, Alta., resident bought a kitten named Vlad for $700 after responding to an ad on Kijiji. \nThe person who posted the ad said they were in Calgary, but the seller told her a friend could deliver the cat to Red Deer. \nDyck sold Vlad several days later to Shaniya Yung, of Blackfalds, Alta., because the cat didn't get along with Dyck's older cat. \n\"For two or three days, it still seemed like it could be a hairless cat, but then it started growing more and more and more hair and whiskers and hair in the ears and things like that,\" Yung said. \nYung said she was shocked at how thoroughly the kitten, a tabby cat, had been shaved, and so was her veterinarian. Vlad had some nicks on his body and an infected cut on his tail, but has made a full recovery . Holly Rattray of Bawlf, Alta., said she arranged to buy this kitten off Kijiji believing it was a hairless sphynx cat. But, after the seller quickly handed off the animal and left, she soon realized it was shaved. She provided these photos of the kitten as she got it, and later once its hair regrew. (Holly Rattray) \nHolly Rattray of Bawlf, Alta., also arranged to buy a hairless cat online, but instead received a meticulously shaved regular kitten. \n\"It's an unbelievable thing that someone would do this,\" she said. \nAfter Rattray put an ad on Kijiji looking to purchase a hairless kitten, she communicated via email and later text message with someone who called himself Tim. \nShe met a friend of Tim's in a Red Deer parking lot. \nThe woman seemed to be in a big hurry, Rattray said, agreeing to take $550 instead of the asked $700 then quickly driving off. \nIt wasn't until later that Rattray was able to fully inspect the female kitten, named Stripes, which had wounds all over its body that Rattray believes were nicks from a razor blade. \n\"We basically just had this kitten thrown at us that was totally, like, mutilated and sliced up,\" she said.",

    "text": "Courtesy of SGIFF  35AM PT \nYuni Hadi , the SGIFF ’s executive director, shares her annual perspective on South East Asian regional cinema and where the revived festival fits in. \nVariety: How has the festival changed or evolved since last year? \nYuni Hadi: “Anyone running a film festival will agree it’s a challenging job to not only be at the forefront of film selection, but also in terms of organizational structuring and staying relevant. Since our return in 2014, we’ve been committed to building a strong foundation as an organization and playing that role in bringing together that film community Southeast Asia. \n“We have a stronger slate of talks and masterclasses this year with the introduction of SG Originals that is focused on the development of Singapore films where we hosting Actors Unscripted with Jack Neo, a VR360 for Singapore short films, a discussion on developing screenplays in Singapore and a talk on with our local sound designers. It’s ultimately a fine balance between serving our local community and audience, and participating in the international festival circuit.” \nVariety: What attracted you to select “Interchange” as the opening film? \nHadi: “For our opening film, we present the Asian premiere Malaysian film ‘Interchange’ by Dain Iskandar Said, a film that’s been on our radar for a while as a much-anticipated project. We appreciate the ambition of the film and think it’s something our audience will enjoy.” \nVariety: What describes the Asian competition selection this year? \nHadi: “Our Asian feature film competition films reflect the dynamic and bold new voices in Asian cinema, leaning towards edgier works. We only select about 10 features every year so it’s a challenging process for us to shortlist. When considering our jury members, we also want them to walk away feeling connected to this part of the world because of the films they have seen and hopefully a part of their experience at SGIFF stays with them.” \nVariety: This year has seen Singapore-made films in Cannes. Have commercial results for Singapore films been up to scratch? What has the Singapore Panorama got to show? \nHadi: “The problem in Southeast Asia is that our independent films often do well at international film festivals and then return home where it’s a challenge to find an audience. But a lot of the times, the filmmaker is making the film for his/her people. Film festivals and alternative film spaces are important for showing these films and putting a context to them through dialogue sessions with the audience. We are living in a time where things and people are valued by the number of “likes” or “followers.” It’s so easy to forget that there are other ways to look at things. We try to offer these different perspectives at SGIFF. \n“Our Singapore Panorama section is always an eclectic mix of films because we are still a young industry and a small one. It’s actually been very beneficial to the local industry in terms of getting to know each other’s work. Some of the films such as ‘Siew Lup’ and ‘4Love’ find their way to the commercial cinemas after SGIFF. Others tour the festival circuit, not that much different from films from other countries.” \nVariety: Last year we discussed the trajectory of SE Asian film-making — you defended Malaysia — what has the past 12 months revealed? How is that reflected in your program? \nHadi: “When we talk about Southeast Asia, we often hear about the potential business markets, news on the political situations and the wonderful resorts that make it a great tourist destination. The moving image is still such a powerful medium today. What filmmakers try to do is explore who we are as people, what we are doing as society and where we are heading. Ultimately at the core of many independent films, commentary and questions are being explored and we see this in all genres of film like sci-fi, drama, comedy, animation, documentary… There’s that need to pause and reflect on what’s going on. And there’s a lot going on in the world today, even just this year alone. \n“Over time, all these films collectively will tell us something about who we are and what was going on at that time. The visuals that are captured act as archives and leave clues. It’s so easy to stereotype or exoticize a certain culture, and film makers are always trying to go against that, to offer a different point of view on what’s really happening. Our job is to provide a certain framework to the films we are presenting. \n“We’ve seen our Southeast Asian filmmakers such as Lav Diaz (Philippines), Apichatpong Weeraseethakul (Thailand), and most recently Anthony Chen and Boo Junfeng (Singapore) winning top awards at some of the best festivals in the world which helps put the spotlight on us. But it’s also very important to have our own film festivals to lead and not just follow. Our Southeast Asian Film Lab offers a real sense of connection to the Southeast Asian community with our mentors and a lab head from Asia. We also put emphasis on our Southeast Asian and Singapore short film competition because it is where we are discovering emerging talent and the highlighting these names to the world. \n“I was recently in Malaysia as jury for a short film competition and I walked away learning a lot after seeing films in different dialects and the kind of subjects young filmmakers are exploring. Singapore and Malaysia are right next to each other but there’s still so much we don’t know. The intricacies and little details of the different cultures show in shorts and independent films that are sometimes glossed over in big budget commercial films, that’s why it’s so important for us to continue to make and watch these films. \n“We have an interesting range of Malaysian filmmakers in SGIFF this year with Ho Yuhang (‘Mrs K’,) Amir Muhammad (‘Voyage to Terengganu’,) Bradley Liew (‘Singing in the Graveyards’,) Lau Kek-Huat (‘Absent Without Leave’) and opening film ‘Interchange.’ Some of these films are involve cast and crew from other countries, and we see that kind of collaboration more and more which is exciting. \n“It’s an interesting time for films right now for both the creators and audience – the way we make and consume films. The thing that doesn’t change is our need to tell our stories and express who we are.” Filed Under:",

    "text": "Posted on November 21, 2016 by Editor - Finance Top Stories \nArticle Attribution and Read More at: Article Source \nA bus carrying dozens of elementary school students crashed in Chattanooga, Tennessee, on Monday, killing at least six children and sending 23 people to a local hospital with injuries, authorities said. \nFive children were found dead on the bus and another died at a hospital, said Melydia Clewell, spokeswoman for the Hamilton County District Attorney’s office. \nRescue teams were still going through the bus so the number of fatalities could change, she said. There are two or three children at the hospital “who could go either way,” she said. \nStudents on the bus, which carried as many as 35 passengers, were in kindergarten through fifth grade, a spokesman for the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said. That would make them roughly ages 5 to 10. \nAsked about the crash following a budget hearing in Nashville, Governor Bill Haslam said the state would offer its assistance. \n“It’s a sad situation anytime there’s a school bus with children involved, which there is in this case,” he said. \nPhotographs issued by the Chattanooga Fire Department showed the bus on its side, wrapped around a tree. \nThe bus driver is being questioned and cooperating with investigators, the Chattanooga Police said on Twitter. \nTwenty-three people were transported in ambulances to a local hospital, and the last patient was extricated from the bus, the fire department said. \nPolice Chief Fred Fletcher called the accident “every public safety professional’s worst nightmare,” the Times Free Press reported. \nTwo bloodied students laid on stretchers in a front yard nearly an hour after the crash receiving attention from first responders, while others not taken to the hospital appeared dazed with cuts on their faces, the newspaper said on its website. \n(Reporting by Frank McGurty and Daniel Trotta in New York; Editing by Howard Goller and Lisa Shumaker) Share This:",

    "text": "Oldest Living Yoga Celebrity Tells All By KATHERINE ROSMAN Continue reading the main story Photo Täo Porchon-Lynch, 98, practicing yoga at the Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Hartsdale, NY. Credit Jennifer S. Altman for The New York Times On a recent Monday, Täo Porchon-Lynch was teaching her 90-minute yoga class in Hartsdale, N.Y., combining elements of Iyengar, meditation and vinyasa for a dozen or so regular students. Ms. Porchon-Lynch’s soft voice was soothing as she called out poses — tree, dancer — and corrected alignment. She demonstrated some floor stretches, though she herself could not do them with perfect alignment on the right. “That’s my side with the hip replacement,” she said, fiddling with a large clip-on earring that had popped off. Actually, it is the side of her most recent hip replacement. She has had three. Ms. Porchon-Lynch is 98, but a poster child for the active life. She is also a dynamic dresser and confident driver. When the class ended, she hurried out of the studio in her bright yoga pants and peep-toe high heels into her new ride, a gray Smart Car . Continue reading the main story She revved the engine a few times before peeling out of the parking lot, en route to teach a private lesson. Then she hurried to the Fred Astaire Dance Studio for her own waltzing lesson; she is a competitive ballroom dancer as well as a yoga teacher. \n  “I’m 50 years younger than her, and her schedule exhausts me,” said Teresa Kay-Aba Kennedy who (along with Janie Sykes Kennedy) was an author with Ms. Porchon-Lynch of the memoir “Dancing Light: The Spiritual Side of Being Through the Eyes of a Modern Yoga Master.” The night before, Ms. Porchon-Lynch and Ms. Kay-Aba Kennedy had returned from California, where Ms. Porchon-Lynch headlined an event for Athleta, an athleisure brand owned by Gap Inc., at its store at the Grove in Los Angeles. She also did a photo shoot for the label. Perhaps more than any other physical regimen, yoga has gotten tremendous public-relations benefit from social media. The images of women and men wrapped into graceful, gravity-defying poses are arresting and highly shareable in the visual worlds of Facebook and Instagram. The result is a new subset of professional instructors: the yogalebrity who makes much of her living on the road, not unlike a small-time rock star, appearing at retreats and conferences, posting inspirational quotes fashioned in flowery Pinterest-friendly fonts, and pictures of inner peace found through arm balances or legs over one’s head. Video Yoga Celebrity Dances Ballroom Täo Porchon-Lynch dances with her competition partner, Anton Bilozorov, at the Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Hartsdale, N.Y. By KATHERINE ROSMAN on Publish Date November 25, 2016. Photo by Katherine Rosman/The New York Times. As a very rare elderly star on this circuit, Ms. Porchon-Lynch has the kind of exceptional marketing potential also glimpsed in the nonagenarians Iris Apfel and Betty White . Athleta will feature Ms. Porchon-Lynch in its January catalog and in its new “Power of She” campaign. “Täo aligns perfectly with our mission,” said Nancy Green, the Athleta president. “We are working hard to break stereotypes of what youth and wellness means.” Meeting Gandhi and Noël Coward Ms. Porchon-Lynch is an avid traveler, who in a few weeks will head to the Berkshires to lead a workshop at Kripalu, and then to Hawaii for another in Maui. And she frequently enters ballroom dance competitions. In 2015, Ms. Porchon-Lynch appeared on “ America’s Got Talent ,” dancing a samba/cha-cha/salsa combination with Vard Margaryan, then 26. Howard Stern, a judge on the show, called the performance “too mind-blowing for words.” A video clip of the performance has been viewed several hundred thousand times. \n  “My partner was 70 years younger than me, and he was throwing me around his neck!” she remembered fondly. Her current teacher and competitive dance partner is even younger: Anton Bilozorov , 25. “I teach her about dance,” he said, “and she teaches me about life.” Ms. Porchon-Lynch was born in 1918. Her mother died in childbirth, and she was raised in Pondicherry , in India, by an uncle who was a railroad entrepreneur and who brought his niece along with him on his Asian travels. When she was 8, she walked to the beach and spotted young boys making silly shapes with their bodies. “I thought it was a new game,” Ms. Porchon-Lynch said. “I went to my aunt and said, ‘Can they let me be part of it?’ And she said: ‘That isn’t a game, it is yoga and it’s not for girls. It’s not ladylike.’ So I started doing it.” The far-flung stories of her life that Ms. Porchon-Lynch tells render her as something of a Zelig figure, from India to Britain to Hollywood. She supplies details and dates with a young person’s mental clarity, and loaded her memoir with photographic evidence. When she was 12, she said, she came home to find “a little man sitting on the floor” and saw visitors bowing to him. Then, she said, her uncle told her to pack a suitcase and they spent a few weeks traveling and marching with Mahatma Gandhi. Photo Ms. Porchon-Lynch practices with her dance partner, Anton Bilozorov. Credit Jennifer S. Altman for The New York Times In the World War II years, she landed in London, having fled India after her family came under Nazi suspicion for hiding British and French expatriates. There, she said, she met Noël Coward when she was working as a dancer in nightclubs. “I didn’t speak English that well and he taught me to say, ‘I presume that your presumptions are precisely incorrectly, your sarcastic insinuations too obnoxious to be appreciated,’” Ms. Porchon-Lynch said, sitting on a bench in the yoga room at the Fred Astaire studio. She then repeated the line, verbatim. “That was in 1940,” she said. She joined a dance troupe that entertained soldiers in Europe, and from there made her way to Hollywood. She worked as a contract actress for M.G.M., teaching yoga to other actresses and traveling back to India when she could to study with yogis including B. K. S. Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois . \n  Wine and High Heels While traveling in New York, she was introduced to an insurance salesman, Bill Lynch. They married in 1963 and eventually settled in Hartsdale, N.Y., a suburb in Westchester County. They had no children, focusing on civic involvement and drinking wine. (Together they founded the American Wine Society . To this day, Ms. Porchon-Lynch drinks only two beverages: tea and wine. She does not drink water.) Mr. Lynch died after a motorcycle accident in 1982, and in the years that followed, Ms. Porchon-Lynch recommitted to her yoga practice. For decades, she has maintained two gigs: teaching yoga three times a week at the Fred Astaire Dance Studio in Hartsdale and twice weekly at the Jewish Community Center in nearby Scarsdale. “She sees things in people they don’t see in themselves,” said Susan Douglass, 61, a trademark lawyer who began studying yoga with Ms. Porchon-Lynch in 1999. “Her students love her. She has a large band of students who would do anything for her.” Ms. Porchon-Lynch’s career really took off thanks to the strategic thinking of a few devoted students. First, Joyce Pines, a retired schoolteacher who has become something of an attaché of Ms. Porchon-Lynch’s, applied to Guinness World Records for special designation. In 2012, Ms. Porchon-Lynch became “The Oldest Living Yoga Teacher .” Around the same time, another student hired Robert Sturman , a photographer, to do a photo shoot of Ms. Porchon-Lynch in Central Park. Mr. Sturman’s work focuses on yogis, including many unexpected practitioners like prison inmates and wounded veterans. Ms. Porchon-Lynch showed up for the shoot in a red ballroom dancer’s flamenco dress and high heels. He questioned her choice to wear spikes to a park, and she told him she only wears high heels. “She said they helped elevate her consciousness,” said Mr. Sturman, who ended up carrying her through the muddy park.

(ABC 7) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday, November 23, 2016, 1:46 AM \nA young humpback whale caught in the shallow waters off Long Island appears to be sick and could be euthanized, officials said. \nResidents in Moriches Bay watched the 25-foot sea creature cruise the waters 70 miles east of New York City for at least a week before learning it was struggling to escape a sand bar over the weekend. \nIt kills me,” Sue Abramski told NBC New York . “I don’t understand why you can’t save the animal. It’s open knowledge that he’s dying. Do something.” \nThe whale may free itself as a high tide settles in the bay but marine experts summoned to check on the mammal may decide to end its life as its precarious condition worsens. \nGov. Andrew Cuomo pledged more resources to state conservation officials and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to “ensure the well-being of the stranded whale,” according to a statement issued Tuesday. \nRiverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation officials said boaters should steer clear of the stranded whale and not attempt a rescue. \n“One flip of its tail and you’d be a goner,” board member Chuck Bowman told the Westhampton Patch . \nThe exhausted whale was barely moving as bystanders crowded the beach to catch a glimpse of the stranded whale. \nWhale sightings are on the rise in the New York area. Another humpback was spied frolicking near the Statue of Liberty this week, a rare sight in the Hudson River and so far from open waters. \nExperts believe it may be hunting for its next meal and was last seen cruising toward suburban Westchester County. \nWith News Wire Services",

    "text": "European Parliament backs plans to create a defence union \nThe EU takes a step closer to the formation of a 'European army' Tuesday 22 November 2016 19:50 BST Click to followThe Independent Online The European Parliament voted 369-255 in favour of creating a defence force AFP/Getty \nThe European Parliament has backed plans to create a defence union which will secure structured cooperation between nations as well as a new EU military operational headquarters. \nLawmakers at the European Parliament voted 369-255 in favour of the proposals, which also calls for greater spending by nations on defence. \nAlthough the vote is not legally binding it does represent support for the proposition before the European Council meets in December to discuss Europe’s defence capabilities. Read more Most refugees arriving in Europe never wanted to come here \nUrmas Paet, the former foreign minister of Estonia, drafted the report and told The Independent he was glad Parliament had made a clear statement on how European defence should now develop. \n“There are more and more risks to Europe related to terrorism, Russia, the Middle East and North and Central Africa,” Mr Paet said. \n“[Currently] if there is some crisis emerging and you need to move military personnel and equipment from one European country to another, then it will take days or even weeks to get all the approvals. \n“It is a very bureaucratic process and we all understand that when it is a crisis there is no time to wait for this kind of stuff.” \nThe plan was proposed in September by France and Germany but some have argued that the new European Defence Union would be a threat to Nato. \nGeoffrey Van Orden, the Conservative’s European defence and military spokesman, argued strongly against the proposals. \n“You can’t have the European Union trying to hijack what is essentially a Nato requirement. You have to separate the requirements for member states, in other words European allies, to spend two per cent of their GDP on defence, which has precious little to do with the EU’s ambitions,” Mr Van Orden told The Independent. \n“The ambitions have been heightened for the creation of a European Defence Union and call it by whatever name you like, some sort of ‘European army’. Although they deny that’s what they want; but it is a ‘European army’ in everything but the name.” \nMr Orden also added that the motivation behind the proposal was to create further political integration and for the EU to act as “some sort of actor on the world stage”.

    "text": "Share Tweet Email \nKARACHI: Pakistan Navy is considering buying super-fast ships from China and Turkey for its special squadron to be deployed at the Gwadar Seaport for the security purpose, officials said on Thursday. \n“A squadron may have four to six warships,” an official of Pakistan Navy told The Express Tribune on the sidelines of the on-going defence exhibition, IDEAS 2016, at the Karachi Expo Centre. \nThe ships would be bought soon keeping in view their immediate need in the fleet, he said, adding two defence ships have already been deployed at Gwadar. The official said the role of maritime forces has increased in Pakistan since the country has made the Gwadar Seaport operational and speeded up economic activities under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). \nHe said China would also deploy its naval ships in coordination with Pakistan Navy to safeguard the port and trade under the CPEC. \nAnother official of the naval force added that Pakistan has kicked off the process of establishing the largest shipyard of the region in Gwadar. A similar ship-building project is being deliberated at the Port Qasim in Karachi. \nThe two advanced shipyards would design and develop ships and other security equipment for Pakistan Navy. \n“The existing shipyard, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, lacks capacity to meet new requirements of the force. Its [PNSC] performance, however, would improve in competition with the two under consideration,” he said. \nHe added the PNSC would hand over a large fleet tanker to Pakistan Navy by June 2016 which is being constructed in collaboration with Turkey. \nWhile paying a visit to IDEAS, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Muhammad Zakaullah said Pakistan Navy is having four dimensional capabilities to face any situation. \n“It is capable of giving the best performance on surface, submarine, naval aviation and special services,” he said. \nMeanwhile, an official of the Pakistan Air Force said it would soon start the process of manufacturing the next generation fighter aircraft at the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Kamra. \nAt present, they are engaged in increasing the number of JF-17 Thunder aircraft into the air force fleet to 250 from the current 70. “Intensive technology is being used to make JF-17 Thunder, Super Mushshak and other military hardware,” he said. \nRana Tanveer Hussain, Federal Minister for Defence Production, said defence exports have increased by $75 million to $100 million during the current tenure of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif government. \n“When PML-N established its government in 2013, defence exporters were worth only $25 million,” he said. \n ",

    "text": "Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments LETHAL blobs of poisonous congealed fat floating around UK beaches, could kill huge numbers of dogs, experts have warned. \nStraight from tropical luxury, the deadly invaders have washed thousands of miles from islands such as Barbados and Jamaica – and now have hit our shores, with the help of storm Angus. 4 Killer fatbergs from the Caribbean are washing up on Blighty’s beaches \nThe fatbergs are particularly dangerous because dogs love the smell of the palm oil contained in the blobs – but if eaten, it is poisonous and has already killed. \nTV vet Marc Abraham has warned owners to keep an eye out for the beach blight. \nHe warned: “Dogs will pick up anything on the beach, from pebbles, to food to palm oil. Vets are warning dogs will die if they scoff the sinister-looking white blobs, some like small boulders \n“These things can cause two-fold problems, the first is gastro, the second is foreign body obstructions. \n“As palm oil is so gelatinous it can get lodged in the esophagus and require emergence surgery. \n“If you think your dog has swallowed something it shouldn’t, contact your vet immediately.” RELATED STORIES Sickening van-sized 'fatberg' made up of dirty nappies, wet wipes and used condoms clogs sewer POSH PROBLEMS 'Lazy' takeaways blamed for causing fatbergs the size of DOUBLE DECKER buses under Oxford THE NEW FATBERGS Huge 'JOHNNYBERGS' made up of vast congealed blobs of condoms are blocking British sewers CLOGGED UP This is the reason why you should NEVER flush face wipes down the toilet LOGJAM Warning huge 'poobergs' of human waste size of 5 ELEPHANTS are clogging sewers \nThe bad weather didn’t help the situation, with Storm Angus battering the UK earlier this week, pushing the blobs onto our beaches – with sightings in Margate and Thanet in Kent. \nA spokesman for Thanet District Council said: “We have received unconfirmed reports that palm oil may be present on some of our beaches. \n“Whilst we are investigating that dog walkers are extra cautious if on the beach.” 4 \nMany experts and dog walkers are worried that there are more poisonous fatbergs floating around our seas, ready to wash up at a moment’s notice. \nFatbergs are generally made up of congealed fat, often mixed with waste such as sanitary towels and face wipes which get thrown down the toilet. \nThese fatbergs are made of Palm oil, that is a waxy substance, yellow or white in colour and smells strongly of diesel or firelighters. \nAlthough you wouldn’t want your children putting the fatbergs in their mouths on the beach, palm oil is found in many every day items such as soap and shampoo and is harmless to humans. \nHowever, in its solid form, it is fatal to dogs – inducing stomach pains, vomiting and diarrhoea. 4 \nVets are warning that this isn’t just a theoretical danger to dogs either, with many pets having died after consuming the deadly blobs. \nOne three year old labradoodle, Freddie, ate a dangerous flatberg on a walk along Kingsand beach, Cornwall, in 2014. \nHis owner Kaen de Fraine, said: “My husband was walking him along the rocks in Kingsand when Freddie ran off and started to eat this large lump of palm oil. \n“It was the size of a boulder. When John realised what was happening he shouted at Freddie, who ran away. \n“We were absolutely panic-stricken when we realised that it was that he had eaten. \n“We looked online and were worried that we could lose him after seeing what had happened to other dogs, so my husband rushed him to the vets straight away.” \nLuckily, after some lifesaving antibiotics and medicine that made poor Freddie vomit up the poisonous fatberg, he made a full recovery. \nKaren said: “We were lucky. We are keeping him away from the beach for now, and I would warn other people to be very, very careful if they do go to the beach. \n“A dog died at Portwrinkle recently from the same thing, so it’s not uncommon!” Enormous Fatberg blocks Cardiff sewers Topics",

    "text": "Bengt Halvorson Deputy Editor \nThe Nissan Versa is the name applied to two different vehicles—a four-door sedan and a more practical five-door hatchback, the Versa Note. Neither offers much in the way of luxury, but their biggest selling points have always been their low prices. \nRegardless of body style, both Versa variants are spacious for their subcompact size class, and both are among the most affordable vehicles in their niche. \nThe current Versa lineup delivers a value-priced alternative to the latest Honda Fit hatchback as well as the Chevrolet Sonic, Ford Fiesta, Kia Rio, Hyundai Accent, Mitsubishi Mirage, and Toyota Yaris. \nThe Versa was most recently redesigned for the 2012 model year and hasn't been substantially updated since. For 2017, the lineup gains a new SV Special Edition package that bundles some nice features—a 5.0-inch audio system with streaming Bluetooth, alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a backup camera—for just $500. At a hair under $17,000, it's actually a pretty good value for a small car, although it's hard to overlook some of this model's inherent weaknesses compared to its domestic and Korean rivals or even a lightly used compact sedan or hatchback. \nMORE: Read our 2017 Nissan Versa review \nThe new Nissan Versa \nThe current Versa four-door debuted as a redesigned model for 2012, trading its predecessor's slab-sided lines for more rounded—some might say bulbous—shapes, and an updated Nissan corporate grille. \nAn all-new Versa Note five-door hatchback with very different styling was added as a 2014 model early in 2013; the two share a common name and some underpinnings but not a single body panel. (You can read a first drive report on the Nissan Versa Note here .) \nAll current Versa sedans are powered by a 109-horsepower, 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engine. The 1.6 S gets notably worse fuel efficiency ratings (27 mpg city, 36 highway, 30 combined) than better-equipped models, because it is available only with a 5-speed manual gearbox or an optional 4-speed automatic. The higher-line models can be ordered with a more fuel-efficient version of Nissan's continuously variable transmission (CVT), which pushes the Versa sedan's ratings to 31/40/35 mpg. \nThe Versa continues to emphasize its value over any other attribute, helping the car appeal to folks who aren't necessarily looking for top performance or amazing fuel economy. It's a nice enough car to pilot in commuting, but the suspension is very soft, which hampers handling. \nThe Nissan Versa's lower price, however, comes with a tradeoff: a very basic interior and minimal driving feel. The latest Versa seems even more bargain-basement than ever in its features and appointments, with drum brakes across the lineup; short, flat seats; hard-and-hollow-feeling dash and door trim; and rear seatbacks that don't fold forward on the less expensive models. But for many buyers, roominess often trumps both of those qualities. \nThe Versa sedan and Note have very good interior room for their size class. Two normal-sized adults can even fit into the back seat in comfort, something not easily claimed by most competitors in the segment. The rear doors open wide to a back seat that's very spacious for the class, easily accommodating two adults or three kids. Those who want the most versatility should choose the Note hatchback, although it costs slightly more. \nThe Versa's safety ratings aren't a complete picture yet. Both the sedan and Note hatch receive four stars out of five overall from the federal government. The IIHS, meanwhile, hasn't fully tested the Versa in either configuration. The Versa Note performed well in the agency's moderate overlap front test, but hasn't been subjected to anything else so far. The sedan, on the other hand, good top marks for that test as well as side impact and roof strength. \nHowever, the 2015 Versa lineup received a \"Poor\" rating—the agency's lowest—for the challenging small overlap test. The 2016 and 2017 have not yet been rated. No collision avoidance or automatic braking tech is available. \nFeatures are meager at the entry level. Air conditioning is now standard, as is Bluetooth pairing and voice control, though power windows and locks are not. (Power mirrors were made standard for 2016.) The mid-range SV model adds the usual convenience items, including power windows and cruise control, while the top-of-the-range SL models can reach around $18,000 when fully optioned with navigation, XM NavTraffic, and USB/iPod controls. \nThe Versa Note was substantially revised in 2017 with a new face and headlights, updated wheels, and new paint colors. The sedan carried over unchanged from the prior year. \nNissan Versa history \nWhen the first-generation Versa was introduced back in 2007, it was the only subcompact to have a standard 6-speed manual gearbox (something it no longer offers, sadly). Both the four-door sedan and the five-door hatchback were equipped with a 122-hp, 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine. At first, a conventional 4-speed automatic transmission was optional, but it was soon replaced by Nissan's continuously variable transmission (CVT). \nNissan added Base models of the Versa sedan in 2009, which were powered by a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder making 107 hp. A 5-speed manual was standard there, as were manual locks and windows, while air conditioning, a stereo, and the automatic transmission were options, all to keep the price down. This lack of features also kept weight down, making the 1.6-liter models a little more fun to drive, if not to be in for long periods of time. The 1.6 was only really adequate if you stuck with the manual transmission, however. Interestingly, the Versa 1.6 got slightly lower fuel economy than 1.8 models, with EPA ratings of 26 mpg city, 31 highway, likely due to gearing that was meant to compensate for the lower engine output. \nVersa S models were better equipped, including most of the basics the Base models forewent, while range-topping SL models came with upgraded sound, height-adjustable seats, power windows and locks, keyless entry, and standard electronic stability control. Although the Versa earned reasonably good safety ratings, prior to 2010 the Base and S models didn't come with standard anti-lock brakes or electronic stability control. \nFor 2010, in addition to the new safety equipment, Nissan added a slightly different grille to the lineup and made large, 16-inch alloy wheels optional, as well as a navigation and a satellite radio. Intelligent Key and Rockford Fosgate sound remained major options.",

    "text": "T he impact of fake news , propaganda and misinformation has been widely scrutinized since the US election. Fake news actually outperformed real news on Facebook during the final weeks of the election campaign, according to an analysis by Buzzfeed , and even outgoing president Barack Obama has expressed his concerns .\nBut a growing cadre of technologists, academics and media experts are now beginning the quixotic process of trying to think up solutions to the problem, starting with a rambling 100+ page open Google document set up by Upworthy founder Eli Pariser.\nFake news and a 400-year-old problem: how can we end the ‘post-truth’ crisis? Read more \nThe project has snowballed since Pariser started it on 17 November, with contributors putting forward myriad solutions, he said. “It’s a really wonderful thing to watch as it grows,” Pariser said. “We were talking about how design shapes how people interact. Kind of inadvertently this turned into this place where you had thousands of people collaborating together in this beautiful way.”\nIn Silicon Valley, meanwhile, some programmers have been batting solutions back and forth on Hacker News , a discussion board about computing run by the startup incubator Y Combinator. Some ideas are more realistic than others.\n“The biggest challenge is who wants to be the arbiter of truth and what truth is,” said Claire Wardle, research director for the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University. “The way that people receive information now is increasingly via social networks, so any solution that anybody comes up with, the social networks have to be on board.”\nJournalists, the public or algorithms? Most of the solutions fall into three general categories: the hiring of human editors; crowdsourcing, and technological or algorithmic solutions. \nHuman editingrelies on a trained professional to assess a news article before it enters the news stream. Its proponents say that human judgement is more reliable than algorithms, which can be gamed by trolls and arguably less nuanced when faced with complex editorial decisions; Facebook’s algorithmic system famously botched the Vietnam photo debacle .\nYet hiring people – especially the number needed to deal with Facebook’s volume of content – is expensive, and it may be hard for them to act quickly. The social network ecosystem is enormous, and Wardle says that any human solution would be next to impossible to scale. Humans are also partial to subjectivity, and even an overarching “readers’ editor”, if Facebook appointed one, would be a disproportionately powerful position and open to abuse.\nCrowdsourced vetting would open up the assessment process to the body politic, having people apply for a sort of “verified news checker” status and then allowing them to rank news as they see it. This isn’t dissimilar to the way Wikipedia works, and could be more democratic than a small team of paid staff. It would be less likely to be accused of bias or censorship because anyone could theoretically join, but could also be easier to game by people promoting fake or biased news, or using automated systems to promote clickbait for advertising revenue.\nAlgorithmic or machine learning vetting is the third approach, and the one currently favored by Facebook, who fired their human trending news team and replaced them with an algorithm earlier in 2016. But the current systems are failing to identify and downgrade hoax news or distinguish satire from real stories; Facebook’s algorithm started spitting out fake news almost immediately after its inception.\nTechnology companies like to claim that algorithms are free of personal bias, yet they inevitably reflect the subjective decisions of those who designed them, and journalistic integrity is not a priority for engineers. \nAlgorithms also happen to be cheaper and easier to manage than human beings, but an algorithmic solution, Wardle said, must be transparent. “We have to say: here’s the way the machine can make this easier for you.”\nHow to treat fake news, exaggeration and satire on Facebook Facebook has been slow to admit it has a problem with misinformation on its news feed, which is seen by 1.18 billion people every day. It has had several false starts on systems, both automated and using human editors, that inform how news appears on its feed. Pariser’s project details a few ways to start:\nVerified news media pages \nSimilar to Twitter’s “blue tick” system, verification would mean that a news organization would have to apply to be verified and be proved to be a credible news source so that stories would be published with a “verified” flag. Verification could also mean higher priority in newsfeed algorithms, while repeatedly posting fake news would mean losing verified status. \nPros: The system would be simple to impose, possibly through a browser plug-in, and is likely to appeal to most major publications.\nCons: It would require extra staff to assess applications and maintain the system, could be open to accusations of bias if not carefully managed and could discriminate against younger, less established news sites.\nSeparate news articles from shared personal information \n“Social media sharing of news articles/opinion subtly shifts the ownership of the opinion from the author to the ‘sharer’,” Amanda Harris, a contributor to Pariser’s project, wrote. “By shifting the conversation about the article to the third person, it starts in a much better place: ‘the author is wrong’ is less aggressive than ‘you are wrong’.”\n\nPros: Easy and cheap to implement.\nCons: The effect may be too subtle and not actually solve the problem.\nAdd a ‘fake news’ flag \nLabelling problematic articles in this way would show Facebook users that there is some question over the veracity of an article. It could be structured the same way as abuse reports currently are; users can “flag” a story as fake, and if enough users do so then readers would see a warning box that “multiple users have marked this story as fake” before they could click through.\n\nPros: Flagging is cheap, easy to do and requires very little change. It would make readers more questioning about the content they read and share, and also slightly raises the bar for sharing fake news by slowing the speed at which it can spread.\nCons: It’s unknown whether flagging would actually change people’s behavior. It is also vulnerable to trolling or gaming the system; users could spam real articles with fake tags, known as a “false flag” operation.\nAdd a time-delay on re-shares \nArticles on Facebook and Twitter could be subject to a time-delay once they reach a certain threshold of shares, while “white-labeled” sites like the New York Times would be exempt from this.\n\nPros: Would slow the spread of fake news.\nCons: Could affect real news as much as fake, and “white-labelling” would be attacked as biased and unfair, especially on the right. Users could also be frustrated by the enforced delay: “I want to share when I want to share”.\nPartnership with fact-checking sites, such as Snopes \nFake news could automatically be tagged with a link to an article debugging it on Snopes, though inevitably that will leave Facebook open to criticism if the de-bunking site is attacked as having a political bias.\n\nPros: Would allow for easy flagging of fake news, and also raise awareness of fact-checking sources and processes.\nCons: Could be open to accusations of political bias, and the mission might also creep: would it extend to statements on politicians’ pages?\nHeadline and content analysis \nAn algorithm could analyze the content and headline of news to flag signs that it contains fake news. The content of the article could be checked for legitimate sourcing – hyperlinks to the Associated Press or other whitelisted media organizations.\n\nPros: Cheap, and easily amalgamated into existing algorithms.\nCons: An automated system could allow real news to fall through the cracks.\nCross-partisan indexing \nThis system would algorithmically promote non-partisan news, by checking stories against a heat-map of political opinion or sharing nodes, and then promoting those stories that are shared more widely than by just one part of the political spectrum. It could be augmented with a keyword search against a database of language most likely to be used by people on the left or the right.\nPros: Cheap, and easily combined withexisting algorithms. Can be used in partnership with other measures. It’s also a gentler system that could be used to “nudge” readers away from fake news without censoring.\nCons: Doesn’t completely remove fake news.\nSharer reputation ranking \nThis would promote or hide articles based on the reputation of the sharer. Each person on a social network would have a score (public or private) based on feedback from the news they share.\n\nPros: Easy to populate a system quickly using user feedback.\nCons: User feedback systems are easy to game, so fake news could easily be upvoted as true by people who want it to be true, messing up the algorithm.\nVisible design cues for fake news \nFake news would come up in the news feed as red, real news as green, satire as orange.\nPros: Gives immediate visual shorthand to distinguish real from fake news. Could also be a browser plug-in.\nCons: Still requires a way to distinguish one from the other, whether labor-intensively or algorithmically. Any mistake with an algorithm, say one that puts Breitbart articles in red, would open Facebook up to accusations of bias.\nPunish accounts that post fake news \nIf publishing fake news was punishable with bans on Facebook then it would disincentivise organizations from doing so.\n\nPros: Attacks the problem at its root and could get rid of the worst offenders.\nCons: The system would be open to accusations of bias. And what about satire, or news that’s not outright fake but controversial?\nTackling fake news on the web outside Facebook News is shared across hundreds of other sites and services, from SMS and messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Snapchat, to distribution through Google’s search engine and aggregations sites like Flipboard. How can fake news, inaccurate stories and unacknowledged satire be identified in so many different contexts?\nFact-checking API \nA central fact checking service could publish an API, a constantly updated feed of information, which any browser could query news articles against. A combination of human editing and algorithms would return information about the news story and its URL, including whether it is likely to be fake (if it came from a known click-farm site) or genuine. Stories would be “fingerprinted” in the same way as advertising software.\nPeople could choose their fact-checking system – Snopes or Politifact or similar – and then install it as either a browser plug-in or a Facebook or Twitter plug-in that would colour-code news sources on the fly as either fake, real or various gradations in between.\nPros: Human editors would become less necessary as the algorithm learns, and wouldn’t have to check each story individually. Being asked to choose a fact-checker might encourage critical thinking.\nCons: Will be labor-intensive and expensive, especially at first. It could be open to accusations of bias, especially once the algorithm takes over from the human input. Arguably only those already awake to the problem would choose to opt in, unless a platform like Facebook or Google assimilates it as standard.\nPage ranking system \n\nMuch like Google’s original PageRank algorithm, a system could be developed to assess the authority of a story by its domain and URL history, suggested Mike Sukmanowsky of Parse.ly .\nThis would effectively be, Sukmanowsky wrote, a source reliability algorithm that calculated a “basic decency score” for online content that pages like Facebook could use to inform its trending topic algorithms. There could also be “ratings agencies” for media; too many Stephen Glass -style falsified reporting scandals, for example, and the New York Times could risk losing its triple-A rating.\nPros: Relatively easy to construct using open-sourcing, and could be incorporated into existing structures. Domains that serially propagate fake information could be punished by being downgraded in rank, effectively hiding them.\nCons: Little recourse for sites to appeal their ranking system, and could make it unfairly difficult for less established sites to break through.\nConnect fake news to fact-checking sites \nUnder this system, fake news would be inter-linked (possibly through a browser plug-in) to a story by a trusted fact-checking organization like Snopes or Politifact. ( Rbutr already does this, though on a modest scale.) \n\nPros: Connects readers with corrections that already exist. Facebook or Google could use a database like Snopes in its algorithm.\nObama is worried about fake news on social media – and we should be too Read more \nCons: Unless this kind of system gets hardwired in to Facebook or Google, people have to want to know if what they’re reading is fake.\nOn current evidence, many people feel comfortable when presented by news which doesn’t challenge their own prejudices and preferences – even if that news is inaccurate, misleading or false. \nWhat many of these solutions don’t address is the more complex, nuanced and longterm challenge of educating the public about the importance of informed debate – and why properly considering an accurate, rational and compelling view point from the other side of the fence is an essential part of the democratic process.\n“There’s a feeling that in trying to come up with solutions we risk a boomerang effect that the more we’re debunking, the more people will disbelieve it,” said Claire Wardle. “How do we bring people together to agree on facts when people don’t want to receive information that doesn’t fit with how they see the world?”\n• Jasper Jackson contributed to this report",

If you're planning to hit the dance floor in Brussels, beware of a new tax and a strange request. \nFew people are aware of it, but a law requiring clubs and music cafes to pay a \"dance tax\" is being enforced in the capital of the EU. \nThis is not EU bureaucracy gone mad. It's the homegrown, Belgian kind imposed by the City of Brussels authorities. \nFor every dancer, establishments have to pay 40 cents (34p/$0.43) per night. \nThe law was adopted two years ago, but some cafes are only now being audited. \n\"The tax inspector explained that the tax is based on the number of people dancing,\" Nicholas Boochie, artistic director of the Bonnefooi venue, told local website Bruzz. \n\"I first thought it was a joke, but it really does turn out to be true.\" \nAt 40 cents per dancer per night, the amount can add up to €2,000 (£1,700) a year, he said, a large sum for a business with a small turnover. It's money he would rather put into hiring more performers. Image copyright Bonnefooi Image caption The music cafe where dancing comes at a price You might also like:",

    "text": "George W. Bush calls North Korea 'the greatest sustained humanitarian challenge of our time' Filed under News at Get Daily Dallas News Headlines Sign Up   \nUNIVERSITY PARK — Former President George W. Bush on Tuesday said North Korea presents the “greatest sustained humanitarian challenge of our time,” calling dictator Kim Jong-un “a sadistic warden” holding the North Korean people prisoner. \n“The North Korean people have suffered decades of oppression, and famine and violence,” Bush said. “By controlling access to the broader world, the North Korean government has tried to make this nightmare seem normal to its victims.” \nBush’s remarks, part of an event at the George W. Bush Institute, come as security concerns over North Korea escalate. The policy institute, which has a program focused on freedom in North Korea , released two reports Tuesday addressing the challenges posed by North Korea’s regime. \nProposed solutions in one report include “assuring important allies in the region, integrating nonproliferation and human rights sanctions, going after slave labor exports that fund weapons development and expanding diplomatic pressure.” \n“North Korea represents a grave security threat,” Bush said. “There is no way to detach ourselves from events in East Asia. Our future and the future of that region are closely linked, and eventually there is no isolation from proliferation, no safety in distance.” \nTuesday’s event at the Bush Center comes as the United Nations Security Council is set to vote Wednesday to impose harsh new sanctions on North Korea for its September nuclear test. According to The Washington Post , the U.N. last imposed some of the harshest economic sanctions in March. \nBush also sent a message to the incoming Trump administration saying that while every administration has the right to choose its own direction, but when it comes to North Korea, “one option that can’t be chosen is the option of drifting off. \n“That current will lead to disaster,” Bush said. “Denial provides only the shallow and temporary illusion of security and leadership on this matter cannot be delegated to others. It can only be led by one country, the United States.” \nBush has long championed human rights in North Korea and has made it a priority at his institute. As president, Bush signed the North Korean Human Rights Act into law in 2004, which worked to promote human rights and freedom to North Korean refugees. The act is set to expire in 2017, but Congress has called for an extension of the bill. Why North Korea? \n“People ask why North Korea? Of all the places, why should the Bush Center be thinking about North Korea,” he said. “North Korea is a remnant of the last century. It’s one of the last Cold War conflicts. It’s the last gasp of totalitarianism, [and] it’s the last fortress of a kind of tyranny that is beginning to leave the earth.” \nBush pointed to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, as another “tyrant to leave the earth.” Castro died Friday after a half-century in power. \n“Like the North Korean leaders, he imprisoned his own people. Like the North Korean leaders, he ruined his country’s economy, and like the North Korean people, the Cuban people deserve better,” he said. \nBush said another way to show commitment to the North Korean people is by supporting refugees in the United States. \n“Refugees often risk everything, everything including their life to come to America,” he said. “Whatever their background they deserve our sympathy, not our contempt.” Helping refugees \nAs part of that effort, also on Tuesday, former First Lady Laura Bush announced a new initiative focused on helping refugees build new lives in the United States. The institute launched a scholarship and mentoring program for North Koreans living in the United States to provide them with education opportunities. \nFollowing Bush’s remarks, there was a discussion about the security and human rights challenges — along with possible solutions and policies — to address North Korea. It featured Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, former Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, Ambassador Robert Gallucci and Victor Cha, the former director of Asian affairs at the White House on the National Security Council. \nGardner, a Republican and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it was important for the new Congress and administration to refocus and reprioritize policies addressing North Korea, in addition to addressing the crisis in the Middle East. \n“We need to make sure this isn’t one of the forgotten issues,” he said. \nGardner said it was important for the new administration to commit to the security of South Korea and to address any United Nations sanctions. \nLieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2000, said it was important for President-elect Donald Trump to be specific on his policies. \n“This is an administration whose foreign policy and detail has not been sketched out, so that unsettles people,” he said. “But it also creates an opportunity for groups like this, bipartisan groups, to try to speak the truth about North Korea to those who will exercise power in the next administration. \n\"The reality is North Korea will be in the face of the next administration whether it chooses to look at it or not.” View Comments",

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading an online poll of readers choice for Time magazines Person of the Year in 2016 honour, which has contenders like US President-elect Donald Trump, the outgoing US leader Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nFor the fourth year in a row, Modi is among the contenders for Times Person of the Year honour, which the US publication bestows every year to the one \"who has most influenced the news and our world in the past year, for good or ill.\" Last year German Chancellor Angela Merkel was Times Person of the Year. While each year Times editors make the ultimate decision as to who from among world leaders, presidents, protesters, astronauts, pop icons and disrupters should be person of the year, it also asks readers to cast their votes and decide who they think most shaped a particular year. Time said the reader poll is an \"important window\" into who they think most shaped 2016.\nAccording to initial votes cast in the readers poll, Modi is leading with 21 percent voting in his favour. For a while Wikileaks founder Julian Assange had overtaken Trump for the lead in the online poll, getting 10 percent of all the \"yes\" votes cast by participants, Time had said. \nHowever, Modi has so far got 21 percent votes, way ahead of Putin's 6 percent, Obama's 7 percent and Trump's 6 percent. It remains to be seen if Modi will maintain his lead as votes polled may change by the time voting on the readers choice poll ends on December 4. \nTime also analysed the moments from 2016 when this years poll contenders were most talked about. For Modi it was October 16, when the Indian leader had suggested during a summit of BRICS nations in Goa that Pakistan is the \"mothership\" for terrorism. \nAmong the contenders this year are former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, FBI Chief James Comey, Apple CEO Tim Cook, parents of slain Muslim-American soldier Humanyun Khan, Khizr and Ghazala Khan, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, British Prime Minister Theresa May and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \nModi had won the readers poll of Times Person of the Year in 2014, securing more than 16 percent of the almost five million votes cast. He was again among the contenders for the annual honour in 2015 but was not among the final eight candidates shortlisted by Time magazine editors for the title. \n\"In 2016, the news and our world were subject to a wide range of influences. A presidential campaign in the United States exposed deep-seated fissures and led to the election of a president without precedent in the nations history. \nElsewhere, leaders like Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan commanded the spotlight on a global stage,\" Time said.

Forbes called him, \"A devout Jew advising a president-elect embraced by the alt-right and supported by the KKK.\"However, Kushner has consistently defended Trump and their close relationship. \"I don’t think it’s very controversial,\" he told Forbes in a report published online Tuesday, \"in an election to become the president of the United States to say that your position is to put America first and to be nationalist as opposed to a globalist.\" Be the first to know - Join our Facebook page. Further, Kushner stated that he feels Trump has been hostilely and incorrectly characterized by the media. \"I just know a lot of the things that people try to attack him with are just not true or overblown or exaggerations,\" he said. And, despite the rash of racist acts and vandalism recently carried out in Trump's name, Kushner insisted, \"I know his character. I know who he is, and I obviously would not have supported him if I thought otherwise. If the country gives him a chance, they’ll find he won’t tolerate hateful rhetoric or behavior.”Regarding the support Trump has garnered from white nationalists and the KKK, Kushner said, \"Trump has disavowed their support 25 times. He’s renounced hatred, he’s renounced bigotry, and he’s renounced racism. I don’t know if he could ever denounce them enough for some people.\" He then paraphrased Ronald Regan in saying \"Just because they support me doesn’t mean that I support them.\"Kushner's faith in Trump, Forbes reported, is matched by his support for Steve Bannon, Trump's recently appointed strategic adviser, who has been embroiled in controversy of his own. \"All I know about Steve,\" Kushner said, \"is my experience working with him. He’s an incredible Zionist and loves Israel.\"An Orthodox Jew, whose wife Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism before they married, Kushner and his family have connections to Israel. Along with his father, also a prominent real-estate developer, Kushner was listed in a 2015 report by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) as a benefactor for its real-estate committee, which required a donation of at least $36,000 to the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group.

Cars submerged under several feet of flood water are abandoned in Hartcliffe, after heavy rain fall from last night and today flooded the street in Bristol Credit: Getty Images \n\"A queueing system has been put in place at Bristol Temple Meads station to ensure passengers can board and alight trains safely,\" he added. \n\"Further localised flooding is impacting services between Bristol Temple Meads and Taunton and those trains that are able to run will be in extremely high demand. \n\"The line between London and South Wales, via Bristol Parkway, is expected to reopen shortly, however service levels will be significantly reduced, with extended journey times.\" \nS ervices between London Paddington and Cardiff were also disrupted, with reports of emergency services helping people from their vehicles. \nDorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue said two people were \"assisted from a vehicle\" on the B3109 in South Wraxall. \nWhile in Carmarthenshire, Wales Dyfed Powys Police said a man was helped from a van which had become trapped in flood water, before it was \"washed away\". Watch | North Devon river swells in size after Storm Angus 00:32 \nM et Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said in the hours between 5am and 5pm on Monday, 48mm of rain fell in Brendon Hill in North Devon, 35mm fell in Bristol, 48.6mm in Pennerley, Shropshire, and 49.4 in Tafolog, Monmouthshire. \n\"We had storm Angus come across Saturday night into Sunday which brought a lot of rain, and with the very wet weather we then had on a heavily saturated ground, that kind of rainfall caused a lot of issues,\" he added. \nHeading into Tuesday Mr Burkill said the weather will be \"a bit better and not quite as wet\". \n\"The heaviest and more persistent rain is clearing northeast wards, so it will affect southern and eastern parts of Scotland through tonight and early tomorrow morning,\" he added. \n\"But behind all the rain across the rest of the UK there is a lot of showers and some of these heavy and thundery at times - these will gradually clear as we go through tomorrow. \n\"It will be a better day, but it is still going to be quite windy.\" After #StormAngus at the weekend and wet and windy weather today, will it turn more settled for the week ahead? https://t.co/ymzOvHLEIM — Met Office (@metoffice) November 21, 2016 \nH e said there are wind warnings for the North and North West England, valid from 9pm until 6am, and a warning for the very South Coast from Hampshire eastwards valid from 1am to 9am, in place. \nMr Burkill said across the south coast gusts of between 50-60mph could be seen with up to 70-80mph on the most exposed coastal parts, with 50-60mph expected in the Northeast with up 70mph on the highest grounds. \n\"Even though the worst of the rain is clearing northwards, we have still got some pretty strong winds to deal with which will likely cause some further problems,\" he added. \nThe Environment Agency warned the forecast of of \"widespread heavy rain and showers\" will affect \"most parts of England over the next 36 hours\" and could cause more flooding. \nClare Dinnis, national flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: \"Environment Agency teams are working hard to reduce the risk of flooding, but we want to remind people not to take unnecessary risks and avoid driving through flood water or walking near swollen rivers. Much of south-western Europe will have a period of very unsettled weather this week. Parts of southern France could have 300-400mm of rain 🌧 pic.twitter.com/IRqThuNB9O — Met Office (@metoffice) November 21, 2016 \n\"People should also take care if walking by the coast as there is a risk of large waves caused by strong and gale force winds.\" \nF ire crews in Manchester have received 120 emergency calls in the space of two hours as heavy rain has caused flooding. \nGreater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service warned people to only dial 999 in an emergency as operators dealt with a \"high volume\" of weather-related calls. \nA spokesman said: \"Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service's (GMFRS) control operators are receiving a high volume of weather-related calls this evening (Monday) and we ask that people only dial 999 in an emergency. \n\"In a two hour period (4pm to 6pm) 120 emergency calls were made by people - mostly reporting flooding and weather-related issues.\" \nThe spokesman said the majority of callers were given advice over the phone but firefighters were called out to a number of incidents. \nCrews helped rescue dogs from kennels in Mossley after the electrics in the building were affected by water. \nFirefighters were called to the kennels on Huddersfield Road at 5.20pm. \nMeanwhile, Devon County Council said 14 schools were shut owing to flooding and in Somerset schools were closed due to \"weather related\" problems, Somerset County Council said on its website.

    "text": "Slam! Bam! Whoosh! Kaboom! No question about it. It’s time to bang on an oil can, click on a lighter, wield your broom, slam your garbage can lids together, wheel that supermarket cart like a speed freak, dance on sand, play plastic radiator hoses like accordions, crush newspaper and trash bags, and just generally feast on a whole lot of noise-making possibilities and enough madly fascinating rhythms to keep your feet in perpetual motion and your ears wide open.\n‘STOMP’\nHighly recommended\nWhen: Through Jan. 1, 2017\nWhere: Broadway Playhouse at Water Tower Place, 175 E. Chestnut\nTickets: $39 – $84\nInfo: http://www.BroadwayInChicago.com\nRun time: 1 hour and 45 minutes, with no intermission\nIn other words, “Stomp,” the aptly advertised “international percussion sensation,” has returned to Chicago — this time around taking up residence in the ideally intimate confines of the Broadway Playhouse at Water Tower Place. And the best part of the news is this: The show, created a quarter of a century ago by Luke Cresswell and Steve McNicholas (English buskers working in the seaside city of Brighton) — and subsequently seen by more than 24 million people in 50 countries — is better than ever, with all the original hijinks in place, plus a few winning enhancements in the form of acrobatic dance moves and a piece of true musical magic. (In addition to the North American and European tours of the show, the Off Broadway production continues to thrive, as does a permanent London company.)\nA scene from the 2012 production of the percussion spectacle “Stomp,” now at Chicago’s Broadway Playhouse. (Photo: Steve McNicholas)\nAbove and beyond all its gonzo spectacle and “you’re in on the joke” comedy, “Stomp” brilliantly draws its audiences into listening in an unusually intense way. In fact, I’ve long thought that if this show could develop a teacher training program it might bring significant change to the whole nature of classroom engagement, for as completely wild and whimsical as the show is, it also possesses the power to focus the mind and spark the imagination. And the moments of quiet are as powerful (and necessary) as the moments when it goes into big bang mode.\nAnd yes, it all begins with one man (John Angeles) and a broom, with the sound of bristles on a stage floor, followed by a gathering of other broom-wielding mischief makers (each with a well-honed personality) capable of generating a gorgeous symphony involving both synchrony and syncopation. (Watching how some of the broom pieces fly off their handles and are instantly replaced by intact ones tossed from the wings is a bedazzling bit all by itself.)\nLater, the cast of eight — six men (with the impossibly fleet and funny Reggie Talley a standout) and two women (keep your eye on Kris Lee in particular) — creates a different sort of magic with wooden poles, eventually launching into a sort of primal ritual circle and then shifting full throttle into fierce pole-to-pole combat.\nAnd then there’s apiece even Igor Stravinsky, the 20th century master of percussive rhythms who gave us “The Rite of Spring,” might applaud. As the stage goes dark, the performers form a horizontal line, and, in an act of mind-boggling concentration, they give us a gorgeous sound and light show —an octet that depends on flipping Zippo lighters open and closed on cue. Equally lovely is a “chamber work” for plastic tubes of different lengths and pitches.\nThe show’s classic corrugated steel wall with balcony becomes an essential part of the act when several performers swing from harnesses and play everything from hubcaps to steel drums. In the “kitchen sink” scene, men arrive with the tubs suspended like giant pendant necklaces from their necks, adding waterworks to the mix. Later, the cast enters wearing gargantuan black inner tubes used to make another boisterous sound. And then there are a couple of sketches in which the cast explores many of the little aural and spatial disturbances of man. A perfect counterpoint. Throughout, the dramatic lighting by McNicholas and Neil Tiplady, displays a rhythm all its own.\nPerhaps the greatest delight in all this is the fact that a whole new generation of theatergoers is getting to see (and hear) “Stomp” — a show ideal for all ages in which the cast invariably uses its well-tempered wit in response to the sound of any baby babble from the audience. Giggles all around.\nA scene from the 2012 production of “Stomp.” (Photo: Steve McNicholas)\n# stomp Luke Cresswell Broadway Playhouse at Water Tower Place",

    "text": "1. Friday the 13th \nReleased: January 13, 2017 \nOh, we've been through the full gamut of emotions waiting for our beloved Jason Voorhees to return to us. After 12 movies and even a lovably odd TV show , the latest Friday the 13th reboot has been kicked around for a while now. First it was a found-footage horror, then a TV show on The CW, and now it's been bumped to 2017. Don't worry Jason — horror fans will always wait for you. 2. IT \nReleased: September 8, 2017 \nThe update of the beloved IT TV miniseries starring Tim Curry as Pennywise has also had development problems. The full cast list for the movie has been revealed. It's tricky to take on a horror classic, but the new Pennywise look is pretty cool! 3. Flatliners \nReleased: 2017 \nThe original Flatliners claimed \"some lines should never be crossed,\" but a Flatliners remake is clearly an exception to this rule. Vampire Diaries 's Nina Dobrev and Hard Candy 's Ellen Page will take the lead roles, and it'll be interesting to see how this decidedly '90s movie, made famous by Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, will adapt to fit with the 2017 box office. 4. Suspiria \nReleased: 2017 \nDario Argento's original Suspiria is one of the finest horror movies of the 20th Century, so the team behind the 2017 reboot have a tough task ahead of them. Fifty Shades of Grey 's Dakota Johnson will take the lead role, and although that seems an odd combination, Johnson is very close to the nubile feminine aesthetic that Argento adored. We'll wait and see. FRESH BLOOD 5. The Dark Tower \nReleased: February 17, 2017 \nStephen King began his Dark Tower novels back in 1982 with The Gunslinger , and the series has only snowballed in popularity. Not since Game of Thrones was brought to life on HBO has a dark fantasy screen adaptation been so hotly anticipated, and with the True Detective complexity of Matthew McConaughey and stalwart presence of Thor 's Idris Elba, The Dark Tower has every possibility of living up to expectations. 6. Death House \nReleased: 2017 \nLong touted as \" The Expendables of Horror,\" Death House certainly boasts an impressive cast of horror movie greats. 2017 will see Death House unite Candyman 's Tony Todd, Friday the 13th 's Kane Hodder, Re-Animator 's Barbara Crampton, The Devil's Rejects ' Sid Haig and Bill Moseley, The Hills Have Eyes ' Dee Wallace and Michael Berryman, and my personal favorite, Sleepaway Camp 's Felissa Rose. With a cast this thrilling, Death House is an appealing prospect no matter what ends up on the screen! 7. Meg \nReleased: 2017 \nSure, we were led to believe that horror giant Eli Roth was going to direct this slice of enormous shark cinema, but Meg is a cool prospect whoever is at the helm. Meg has actually been in the works for twenty years , but has been repeatedly sidelined to make room for other shark movies such as Deep Blue Sea at the box office. Based on Steve Alten's Meg: A Novel of Deep Terror, expect 2017's take on the Jaws phenomenon with some killer effects to match. 8. Abruptio \nReleased: May 31, 2017 \nLes Hackel ( Buffy 's James Marsters) wakes up to find an explosive device has been implanted into his neck, and he must complete a series of increasingly unpleasant tasks or risk the device destroying him. Abruptio has the distinction of featuring Nightmare on Elm Street legend Robert Englund, so will be received with open arms from the horror movie community. \n9. The Chair \nReleased: 2017 \nThe Chair is an adaptation of the Alterna Comics graphic novel of the same name, and follows an innocent man trapped on Death Row, forced to commit increasingly brutal acts to protect himself from the sadistic prison warden. The latter is played by Bill Oberst Jr., and ever-reliable villain and star of Take This Lollipop , possibly the scariest thing I've ever seen on the internet. 10. Sky Sharks \nReleased: September 1, 2017 \nLook, it's not going to win any César awards, but this is a movie that has Nazis and sharks flying around in the sky! Approach this peculiar beast with the same drunken wide-eyed optimism you would employ towards Sharknado or Zombeavers and get a bunch of horror fan buddies over to watch the totally ridiculous events unfold. SEQUELS 11. Saw Legacy \nReleased: 2017 \nIt may be the eighth installment of the Saw series, but that doesn't mean that we've seen the last of Billy the creepy-ass puppet. Sure, a few major deaths within the series may have hampered future plotlines for certain characters, but there are many loose ends to tie up in Saw 8 . Who knows where Jigsaw's fiendish legacy will take us? 12. Resident Evil: The Final Chapter \nReleased: January 27, 2017 \nSince the first Resident Evil film in 2002, fans of horror movies have adored the franchise. Milla Jovovich returns as our indefatigable heroine for what is currently claimed to be The Final Chapter , but remember that this is the horror genre we're talking about; the Final Friday for Jason Voorhees was only the ninth movie of 12 Friday the 13th movies and counting. 13. World War Z 2 \nReleased: June 9, 2017 \nHorror fans are always receptive to movies about zombies, especially when those zombies are taken from much-loved horror novels. Max Brooks's World War Z saga continues June 9, 2017, and it's the magnificent set-pieces that display the scale of the zombie takeover that horror lovers will be looking forward to, especially if the World War Z 2 keeps to the rather bloodless PG-13 approach of the first movie. 14. Annabelle 2 \nReleased: May 19, 2017 \nIt's a pity that sentient dolls are invariably evil. It'd be kind of cool to have one of the lil critters to chat to, but less cool when they tried to gouge out one of your eyes with their fiendish doll claws, but I digress. Annabelle 2 will be the sequel of the spin-off of The Conjuring , proof if it were needed that the Blumhouse horror empire is going from strength to strength. No doubt the freaky accursed doll will be up to more hellish hijinks in Annabelle 2 . 15. Hellraiser: Judgement \nReleased: 2017 \nHellraiser: Revelations came in 2011 but it feels like forever since we got our last hot Cenobite injection. The news that Doug Bradley would not be returning as Hell Priest \"Pinhead\" was met with some dismay by horror fans, but images of Paul T. Taylor (see above) promise a striking vision in keeping with Clive Barker's murky underworld creation. The addition of Nightmare on Elm Street Final Girl Heather Langenkamp only makes this horror movie all the more enticing. 16. Insidious 4 \nReleased: October 27, 2017 \nYup, we're off into The Further once more ! While Insidious 3 focussed mostly on Elise Rainier , it's expected that Insidious 4 will take a different tack. Fans are keen to see the cliffhanger ending of Insidious 2 expanded upon, and with a world as fantastical and limitless as The Further there's no doubt that Blumhouse will dream up something weird and wonderful for us. 17. Amityville: Awakening \nReleased: January 6, 2017 \nIf you're a little confused that Amityville: Awakening is only released in 2017, that's understandable — the movie was originally set for release January 2, 2015! For various film industry reasons beyond my understanding, it's been pushed to early 2017, making this long-awaited Amityville installment the only movie on this list with a viewable trailer available . Amityville: Awakening is directed by P2 and Maniac helmer Franck Khalfoun, so this is one to watch out for. Which of the horror movies released in 2017 are you most stoked for? ",

    "text": "Warner Bros. Television I have never watched The Gilmore Girls.\nI mean, I have seen episodes. Conversationally, I can tread water just long enough to make you think I know exactly why Logan is the worst or why Jess is also the worst. I can make jokes about Dean’s hair and coat, and I can confidently state that Paris seems like somebody with whom I’d be friends. I have nodded and I have acknowledged and I have watched enough reruns to know that Luke is not Christopher who is Rory’s dad and Loralei's ex. I know Emily is the kind of older woman I aspire to be. But that’s it. That’s all.\nAnd none of this was a problem until the series announced its Netflix reboot. I’d spent my adult life ducking Gilmore Girls analysis and dropping declarative sentences like “Ugh — typical Dean” to fool acquaintances into thinking I was a member of their inner sanctum. But I’m not. I’m a fraud. And here’s what I think the show is really about.\n1. Rory and Lorelai are very close and that's not necessary the best thing.\nI mean, right? Once I saw an episode where Lorelai and Christopher hooked up and Rory was like, 14, and clued in and just gave a knowing nod, and I am certain no other 14-year-old would be that chill about anything, let alone the sex lives of their parents. At no point does anybody stop and say, “Hey, you guys aren’t friends, FYI.” The other day my Mom said, “We’re not best friends” and I told her I knew that and in that moment we were closer than we’ve ever been.\n2. Lorelai comes from money and acts like she no longer has money. But, really, come on — she has money.\nI know that Lorelai had Rory at 16 and stopped talking to her rich parents to start life anew in Stars Hollow. Terrific! She also somehow goes from being very broke and 16 to working her way up the hotel management chain where she’s currently the boss. Equally great! And obviously, compared to her very rich parents, Lorelai’s economic status is “humble.” But also obviously, she and Rory are very affluent, particularly since they’re always wearing new clothes and their house is very nice. It’s small, but it’s nice. It’s very, very nice. Like, can I say they’re rich? I’m saying it. I’m saying they’re rich. Just not compared to Lorelai’s parents whose home is built on a million $100 dollar bills.\n3. They live in Stars Hollow and it's cheesy af.\nThere are about 13 residents total and they all know each other’s business and it is bananas . They also seem to take their city council meetings very seriously when they're about things like craft fairs. Also, nobody locks their doors and everybody swings by everybody’s homes. If a person rings my doorbell or knocks on my door now, I freeze in place and refuse to move and consider calling the police.\n4. Theme nights are for sure a thing that matter in Stars Hallow.\nOne of the episodes I’ve seen (I have seen about 12 and I have seen this specific episode four times, I don’t know why) revolved around a 1940s-themed dance-off that led to the demise of Dean and Rory in the wake of . . . Jess? I think? Sure. Who cares. What matters is that this is an activity that teenagers chose to partake in. Teens, in this town, think dressing up for a 1940s-themed dance-off is a wonderful choice. So these teens are not real. They are like if aliens tried to be teens.\n5. Jess is a “bad boy,” Dean is a farmer, and Logan is a rich baby-bitch.\nJess gets sent away to live with his Uncle Luke and he is “bad,” but also he likes books, and that is #hot. He is also played by Milo Ventimiglia, who I am dating (in my mind). Dean is played by Jared Padalecki and has had the same haircut since 2001. He also seems to be wearing an oversize green coat at all times, which should’ve been a red flag from the beginning. Logan is blonde. He is rich. He is boring and entitled. He is the wrong kind of “bad boy.” (Like, he’s just shitty.)\n 6. Melissa McCarthy is in this\nAnd so is Sally Struthers, and the fact that neither of them got a spin-off or their own talk show or something made entirely for me is cruel and unfair and how dare everyone.\n7. There are so many misunderstandings.\nThis is a feelings show. Everyone’s got feelings. Hugging ensues. Heart-to-hearts.\n8. There is a Christopher/Luke/Lorelai love triangle.\nI know this because when I worked at American Eagle, there was a promo on one of our DVDs that played four times an hour. “I slept with Christopher!” was a thing that was said no less than 1,600 times, so I know this happens and that it is very upsetting. Luke seems “gruff,” so this probably bothers him but he never lets anybody know. Basically, this is Pam, Jim, and Karen from The Office , but with far worse communication skills.\n9. Everyone wears vests.\nRemember that Gap campaign from 1999? That’s exactly what I think about whenever I imagine the Gilmore Girls ’ wardrobe department. Sweaters, vests, toques. There are mittens. Flared jeans.\n10. The obsession with coffee is truly OTT.\nLuke’s Diner makes coffee and it is so good that real, living people we know in our real lives lined up at fake Luke’s Diners across North America this October to drink it. But also, his diner seems to be the only coffee shop in Stars Hollow? Like, there’s no Starbucks or Tim Horton’s or Dunkin’ Donuts. But everybody runs on coffee to the point that it’s a thing . (“First, coffee.” Or something.) So explain the logistics of that to me. How are there never any lines?\n11. Pop-Tarts are a breakfast food.\nCo-sign.\n12. Rory goes to a fancy, uniformed school.\nAnd it’s called Chilton because I saw mention of it on Tumblr this week. This seems to be a school for people who are wealthy and guaranteed places in law schools or . . . whatever it is businesspeople do. Congratulations, everybody!\n13. And Rory and Lorelai go to Lorelai's parents’ once a week for dinner.\nI think this is because Lorelai went MIA for 300 years. I also think that I don’t know anyone who has proper family meals with their parents on a Friday night because it is a Friday night and also their parents have shit to do. But this takes place in Connecticut so life might be different there.\n14. The soundtrack is very chill and college-radio-esque.\nBut not college radio like The O.C. — this is way more coffee-house. Carole King sings the theme song.\n15. A girl’s best friend is her mother.\nRory doesn’t seem to have a ton of friends. She has Lane and she has Paris and then she has her Mom. Where are the other #teens? Why aren’t there visits to the mall? Why are there four teens in the entire village? Rory seems super cool and nice, but her go-to about everything is still her mother, which is fine sometimes but also not a thing that tends to happen IRL, ever. I remember being younger and thinking I wanted to be like Rory Gilmore, based on the two episodes I saw. And then I realized real quick that no thank you, because it was Friday night and I had a food court and a Claire’s Accessories to loiter around.\nFollow Anne on Twitter .\nAdvertisement ",

(Limited engagement begins Thursday, November 24; various times, locations, and prices; rated R)\nThe Nutcracker Along with the arrival of many other holiday standbys, Boston Ballet’s first performance of The Nutcracker is on Friday. Choreographed by Boston Ballet artistic director Mikko Nissinen, the performance is sure to be masterful as always. (Opens Friday, November 25; various times; The Boston Opera House; $35+)\nSkating at Frog Pond With a cold but successful free opening day of skating on Tuesday, the Frog Pond ice rink reopened for the season. Even though skating was only free for opening day, the prices (and the atmosphere) make the Frog Pond a bargain. (Friday November 25 and Saturday, November 26 from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday, November 27 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Boston Common Frog Pond; $6 for skaters 58 inches and over, free for skaters 58 inches and under; all ages)\nPhotos on the Field with Santa at Gillette Stadium Ever dreamed of standing on the same gridiron that Tom Brady patrols on any given Sunday? Patriot Place is opening its doors for a chance to step on the field and snap a photo with Kris Kringle in exchange for a donation of a gently used coat or hat and glove set to Cradles to Crayons . There will also be free grilled cheese, music from 103.3 AMP Radio, and ice skating while you wait. (Saturday, November 26 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m; Gillette Stadium; donation of clothing or $20; all ages)\nHelping the Homeless Thanksgiving isn’t just about giving thanks, it’s about giving back. We highlighted 60 ways you can give back this holiday season, but one in particular is the Blessing Bags for the Homeless event, hosted by the United Sisters of Color , a local organization that hits the streets each November to hand out bags full of living essentials like toothpaste, soap, and pairs of socks to those in need. (Saturday, November 26 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.; Lena Park Community Center; free; all ages)\nThe Charles Hotel Annual Tree Lighting Event Though it may not match the pageantry (or television coverage) of the Faneuil Hall tree lighting, Cambridge has a holiday tree lighting ceremony of its own outside the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square. Along with live performances and an appearance from Santa Claus, this family-themed event will also have free hot chocolate and cookies from Shake Shack and Henrietta’s Table, respectively. (Saturday, November 26; entertainment starts at 4 p.m., tree lighting at 5:30 p.m.; The Charles Hotel; free; all ages)\nBoston Tuba Christmas Concert More than 150 tuba players will serenade Faneuil Hall with loads of holiday tunes for the 31st consecutive year. (Saturday, November 26 at 2 p.m.; Faneuil Hall Marketplace; free; all ages)\nStar Wars Night and Zoo Lights at Stone Zoo With Rogue One flying into theaters next month, the Stone Zoo is celebrating with a themed Star Wars night that coincides with the opening of Zoo Lights , the festive animal-themed light display that takes over the zoo each winter. Scattered among the animals and twinkling displays will be local members of the 501st Legion dressed in movie-quality Star Wars costumes, on hand to take photographs with adoring fans. The zoo is encouraging visitors to wear their own Star Wars costumes as well. (Sunday, November 27 from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m.; $9 general admission, $8 for zoo members; all ages)",

Credit: Twitter \nAn amusement park in Japan has been forced to close its ice-skating rink after a gimmick featuring thousands of fish frozen beneath a layer of ice prompted widespread anger on social media. \nSpace World, in the south-western Japanese city of Kitakyushu, was criticsed for its \"cruel\" and \"immoral\" skating rink, which featured around 5,000 dead sprats, mackerel and other fish. \nThe fish had been bought from a local market and embedded in the ice, some with their mouths still open in an apparent attempt to convey a sense of animation, local media reported. \nOther parts of the rink showed whale sharks and sting rays suspended beneath ice. However, Space World maintained that they were merely enlarged photographs. \nSocial media users vented their anger on Space World's Facebook page, with some saying the attraction, which promised to allow visitors to \"glide across the sea\", showed an \"appalling lack of morality\". \nIn a statement quoted in the Japan Times on Sunday, Space World said: \"We deeply apologise to people who felt uncomfortable about the Ice Aquarium event. As a result, we have stopped the event from today.\" \nA spokesperson for the amusement park told the Asahi Shimbun that the fish were already dead when they were purchased, and added that the park was considering holding a memorial service for the fish next year.

More than 500 people indicated through social media that they were going to the protest, but early on in the protest, about 150 protesters had shown up. The protest in part is aimed at denouncing the city’s implementation of the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, COPA, instead of a version preferred by protesters. That alternative watchdog, dubbed the Civilian Police Accountability Council, would be made up of members elected by the public.\nProtesters chanted a familiar refrain Friday, “Rahm Emanuel has got to go,” and held up signs called for CPAC.\nOne of the signs at the Mag Mile Black Friday protest Friday. | Stefano Esposito/Sun-Times\n“The boogeyman is no longer under your children’s bed,” protester Eric Russell. “The boogeyman wears a blue uniform and carries a badge.”\nSome protesters say they are pleased that Cook County has a new prosecutor to replace State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez, but they want more.\n“We consider those to be victories, but . . . not one police officer has been . . . jailed,” said Frank Chapman, one of the protest organizers.\nOne protester, Kim Harris, 51, lives in Michigan but grew up in Chicago. She was visiting relatives in the city.\nWhy not give the new prosecutor and police chief a chance?\n“Because the corruption is continuing,” Harris said. “We’re losing children at a rate that is too high. There is not enough time for us to to give them time. We need to put the pressure on them.”\nChicago Police were spread out along Michigan Avenue in anticipation of the protest.\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow PUSH Coalition organized the protest last year in the wake of the release of the Laquan McDonald shooting video. Hundreds of protesters marched along North Michigan Avenue, with some preventing shoppers from entering stores. Four people were arrested.\n# Black Friday boycott Chicago",

He was taken ill at his grouse shooting estate, Abbeystead House in Lancashire, and later died in hospital. The father-of-four was Britain's third richest man and the richest property developer in the UK, whose vast wealth came from estates in Oxford, Cheshire, and Scotland as well as huge swathes of Mayfair and Belgravia. His widow, Natalia Phillips, is a godmother to Prince William and their son, Hugh, 25, who inherited the dukedom, is godfather to Prince George. The couple also had three daughters, Lady Tamara, Lady Edwina and Lady Viola.

Pakistan today committed ceasefire violations in Bhimber Gali, Krishna Ghati and Nowshera sectors of Kashmir, ANI reported.Yesterday, terrorists actively backed by the Pakistan army killed two soldiers and beheaded one soldier in gross violation of the Geneva Convention. \"Retribution will be heavy for this cowardly act of mutilating a soldier's body,\" the Army said yesterday. The Army destroyed four Pakistan army posts with massive fire assaults after an Indian soldier was beheaded October 28, in a similar border action team (BAT) operation as yesterday's. A BAT typically consists of terrorists working in close conjunction with Pakistan army regulars for tactical operations against Indian troops and posts along the 778km Line of Control (LoC). Yesterday, the three slain soldiers from 57 Rashtriya Rifles were in the lead of a counter-infiltration patrol when the patrol was ambushed by terrorists ahead of the LoC fencing in the thickly-forested, mountainous Macchil sector in the morning.\"The Pakistan army simultaneously opened fire at our patrol. Once the situation stabilised, the three bodies were found in the search operation... one was badly mutilated,\" said an officer yesterday.\"Condemn the cowardly and brutal killing of our soldiers, and mutilation of one of them. Salute these brave martyrs for their supreme sacrifice,\" tweeted Defence minister Manohar Parrikar yesterday.Since the October 28 beheading of a soldier, the Army has been conducting targeted fire assaults with heavy-calibre weapons, including artillery guns, 120mm mortars and anti-tank guided missiles, to inflict heavy casualties on the Pakistan army by flattening some of its forward posts and bunkers.

    "text": "RESTAURANT REVIEW Rescue this resto please–and, with it, our childhood memories It is like my direwolf or horcrux or avatar, and I simply cannot imagine life without it   / 03:00   \nPancake House and I were born on the same year. I grew up with it, and it with me. At some point in both our careers, we sold out. We had to; it’s simply the way one copes with change. \nLike me, it’s going through something of a midlife crisis, though it’s a toss-up who’s managing it better. \nBecause I couldn’t let the opportunity pass to have my children grow up on the strange but impossibly irresistible combination of a syrup-drenched waffle with a morsel of juicy pork sausage (an outlandish combination that’s replicated in our predilection for dipping McDonald’s french fries in our ice-cream sundaes), I would take my two-year-old daughter to our nearest branch, tucked away facing a back courtyard of Rockwell’s Power Plant Mall. ADVERTISEMENT \nHere, she was introduced to the joys of exploding tacos, the kind that shatters into a million bits when you try to eat it properly. (They now have an item on the menu called Taco Salad, which is basically pre-exploded tacos.) There was a time we would be at Pancake House almost every weekend. \nAround that time, I started working for Rogue Magazine, then under a previous ownership. In the best journalistic tradition, work started sometime around mid-afternoon and, on a slow day, ended around dinnertime. On the week when we closed the magazine, going home at three or four o’clock in the morning was customary. \nAlso in the best journalistic tradition, we ate unhealthily. At around late afternoon, we would all begin feeling hungry, but no one wanted to be the first to say anything about it, because then he or she would have to choose the restaurant and be in charge of having food delivered. \nCentralized service \nEventually we came to rely on Pancake House, simply because it was the only restaurant within a few kilometers’ radius of our office. \nOur relationship became so close that our managing editor would simply call the kitchen and ask for our usual orders. I had the same thing, a Salisbury steak (pronounced sah-lis-berry), for almost six months before getting tired of it. \nI can point to my back issues of Rogue and tell you which ones were powered by Pancake House. \nOur breakup came when they introduced a centralized delivery service. Suddenly, we weren’t allowed to call the local branch a few doors down and ask them to bring the food over. We had to call a centralized call center and talk to a new person every day. Not only did they never get it right, but it took them an eternity to transmit the request to the local branch. \nThe other day, just as my second child reached the age when I began taking my firstborn to Pancake House, I decided it was time to introduce yet another toddler to the addictive mixture of lightly fried carbohydrates drenched in butter and syrup. \nCosmetic changes \nPancake House at Rockwell has moved out of the mall to the ground floor of the building next door, and undergone something of a facelift. Gone are the movie posters and the brightly colored plasticky banquettes; there’s a faux-timbered ceiling and stucco murals on the walls. \nI don’t mind the cosmetic changes. Much as I’m into nostalgia, it was time for a change. \nBut as for the food, change has come—and for the worse. The coffee was so tepid that the creamer (note that they did not deign to offer me actual milk) simply clumped up into a big floating nugget of slimy powder and refused to amalgamate. The toast that came with my country breakfast wasn’t toasted, which goes against its ontology, making it simply bread. \nIt wasn’t just one occasion. On another day, the arroz cubana I ordered came with a flat disc of egg white with a yellow smudge where the yolk used to be. Having an egg run on the frying pan can happen to anyone; if one has any pride at all as a chef, you don’t carve out the broken yolk and serve it anyway. \nThe plantains weren’t fried, and were hard and woody. Service at Pancake House has never been great in general, but the staff seemed composed of waiters who were very interested in something on the wall just a few inches to the left of my head, and there was nothing I could do to distract their attention. \nRadical level \nI’m writing this not because I want Pancake House to fail; it’s like my direwolf or horcrux or avatar, and I simply cannot imagine life without it. I want the management to fix it, at a radical level. \nOne gets the feeling of cooks and service staff sleepwalking through the manual, moving from one payday to the next. The world of casual sit-down franchise restaurants is something I have no experience with, but the staff, while uniformly polite and accommodating, seems to be as indifferent to the identity of the restaurant as to the well-being of its customers. \nThis is an impassioned plea to the management to rescue the restaurant, and with it all my vanilla and caramel-scented childhood memories and those that I want my children to have as well. —CONTRIBUTED",

According to earlier reports, the film was supposed to be released on April 7 but now the date has been pushed to April 21. Trade analyst Taran Adarsh took to Twitter to announce the release date of the film. He wrote, “#Noor now arrives on 21 April 2017. Stars Sonakshi Sinha. Directed by Sunhil Sippy. Produced by Bhushan Kumar and Vikram Malhotra.” \nLater, the actor also took to Twitter to give us a sneak-peek into the kind of character she plays in the film. She wrote, “She’s sunshine mixed with a little hurricane. She’s every girl. She’s #Noor #IAmNoor Now arrives, 21st April, 2017.” \nAlong with the tweet, Taran also shared a new poster from the film in which Sonakshi comes out as a perfect poser. When the first look from the film was released, it was assumed that the actor is playing a Pakistani journo in the film but recently Sonakshi scrapped all such rumours. She said, “All I can say is that I am not playing a Pakistani journalist in the film. The story has been adapted into a Mumbai backdrop.” She’s sunshine mixed with a little hurricane. She’s every girl.

The movie also stars Purab Kohli, Shibani Dandekar and Kanan Gill. The film is an Indian adaptation of Pakistani author Saba Imtiaz’s novel Karachi, You’re Killing Me. \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nSonakshi had recently appeared on-screen with John Abraham in Force 2, which became the actor’s second consecutive action film.

Voices It’s impossible for the government not to screw up Brexit with only 24 months to seal the deal \nFrom figuring out the negotiations guidelines to drawing up a transition deal, parliament’s vote, European Court of Justice reviews and even talks about who gets what wine from the Commission’s cellar, drawing up a Brexit deal will take years not months Wednesday 23 November 2016 11:55 BST Click to followThe Independent Online As the deadline approaches, an extension is not likely for Theresa May Getty \nIt has become conventional wisdom to assume that the EU will exact a price from Britain for leaving the EU; that some European countries are out to punish the UK, and that all they need to do is wait and a desperate Britain will strike a bad deal. Similarly, there is little to suggest that the UK will view the negotiations as anything but an adversarial, zero-sum affair. \nBut even if we assume the negotiations will be calm, cool and collected, and that politicking takes a backseat, the time challenge presented by Article 50 is enormous. When Article 50 is activated by Theresa May, Britain will get 24 months to conclude a decent divorce agreement with the rest of Europe. If a deal cannot be reached within that time, Brexit will be direct, dramatic and disorderly. \nMay’s notification will sound the opening bell for a flurry of discussions. But at least initially, these will not involve London. The EU’s 27 other member-states will first have to agree on the negotiating guidelines for the Commission, and aligning different interests will take time. Britain has refused to ‘show its hand’ and Europe has avoided pre-negotiations. So, since the referendum, the leaders of the 27 have only met twice to discuss Brexit , with the next meeting scheduled for February in Malta. Expect a few more meetings and delays before the EU’s guidelines are agreed. \nWhen the chief negotiators on both sides – Michel Barnier and David Davis – finally meet, their first order of business will be talks about the talks. They must agree on crucial procedural issues including whether to negotiate the withdrawal agreement and a future trade deal in parallel or one after the other, and how to negotiate a transitional agreement to avoid a ‘cliff-edge’ while finalising a comprehensive trade deal after Britain has formally left the EU. The transitional agreement is likely to grant the British more access to the EU’s single market than the final trade deal, and could be very cumbersome to agree. EU’s position in Brexit negotiations 'does not make sense' \nLess high-brow but no less important, Barnier and Davis will need to settle issues like how often to meet, where to meet, who can be present at the meetings, and even perhaps, what language to use . \nTowards the end of the divorce talks, more time will be lost. Article 50 says that a withdrawal agreement has to enter into force within 24 months. That means any parliamentary consent, including from the European Parliament, must be given before the two years are up. The British parliament will vote on the final agreement – and that could take up to six weeks – but so might others. \nSince the rights of EU workers in the UK will be a key feature in the divorce, Central European parliaments might seek a proper debate before their governments sign off on any deal. \nNeither should we dismiss the possibility that the European Court of Justice will be asked to give its views on the legality of the divorce terms. In 1991 the Court unpicked some elements of the new European Economic Area – even after all countries involved had agreed to its design – causing a year long delay. \nAs for the meat of the Article 50 talks, it is not just about who pays the pensions of British EU civil servants. Article 50 covers many delicate areas including the UK’s new schedule of WTO commitments and British access to European counter-terrorism databases. What experts have said about Brexit What experts have said about Brexit 1/11 Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond \nThe Chancellor claims London can still be a world financial hub despite Brexit “One of Britain’s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all of the services the global financial services industry needs” “This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world’s leading international financial centre.” Reuters 2/11 Yanis Varoufakis \nGreece's former finance minister compared the UK relations with the EU bloc with a well-known song by the Eagles: “You can check out any time you like, as the Hotel California song says, but you can't really leave. The proof is Theresa May has not even dared to trigger Article 50. It's like Harrison Ford going into Indiana Jones' castle and the path behind him fragmenting. You can get in, but getting out is not at all clear” Getty Images 3/11 Michael O’Leary \nRyanair boss says UK will be ‘screwed’ by EU in Brexit trade deals: “I have no faith in the politicians in London going on about how ‘the world will want to trade with us’. The world will want to screw you – that's what happens in trade talks,” he said. “They have no interest in giving the UK a deal on trade” Getty 4/11 Tim Martin \nJD Wetherspoon's chairman has said claims that the UK would see serious economic consequences from a Brexit vote were \"lurid\" and wrong: “We were told it would be Armageddon from the OECD, from the IMF, David Cameron, the chancellor and President Obama who were predicting locusts in the fields and tidal waves in the North Sea\" PA 5/11 Mark Carney \nGovernor of Bank of England is 'serene' about Bank of England's Brexit stance: “I am absolutely serene about the … judgments made both by the MPC and the FPC” Reuters 6/11 Christine Lagarde \nIMF chief urges quick Brexit to reduce economic uncertainty: “We want to see clarity sooner rather than later because we think that a lack of clarity feeds uncertainty, which itself undermines investment appetites and decision making” Getty Images 7/11 Inga Beale \nLloyd’s chief executive says Brexit is a major issue: \"Clearly the UK's referendum on its EU membership is a major issue for us to deal with and we are now focusing our attention on having in place the plans that will ensure Lloyd's continues trading across Europe” EPA 8/11 Colm Kelleher \nPresident of US bank Morgan Stanley says City of London ‘will suffer’ as result of the EU referendum: “I do believe, and I said prior to the referendum, that the City of London will suffer as result of Brexit. The issue is how much” 9/11 Richard Branson \nVirgin founder believes we've lost a THIRD of our value because of Brexit and cancelled a deal worth 3,000 jobs: We're not any worse than anybody else, but I suspect we've lost a third of our value which is dreadful for people in the workplace.' He continued: \"We were about to do a very big deal, we cancelled that deal, that would have involved 3,000 jobs, and that’s happening all over the country\" Getty Images 10/11 Barack Obama \nUS President believes Britain was wrong to vote to leave the EU: \"It is absolutely true that I believed pre-Brexit vote and continue to believe post-Brexit vote that the world benefited enormously from the United Kingdom's participation in the EU. We are fully supportive of a process that is as little disruptive as possible so that people around the world can continue to benefit from economic growth\" Getty Images 11/11 Kristin Forbes \nAmerican economist and an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England argues that the economy had been “less stormy than many expected” following the shock referendum result: “For now…the economy is experiencing some chop, but no tsunami. The adverse winds could quickly pick up – and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction” Getty \nBut if anything Article 50 has all the ingredients to become a fight about money. Here are some of the thorny issues that need resolving: Britain must be untangled from the European Investment Bank, and its 16 per cent share of the bank’s capital – nearly 40 billion euros – must be returned. EU grants will need to be repaid and fishing quotas adjusted. Someone will have to pay for relocating the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority from London. In turn, the UK will claim its share of EU assets – from EU offices down to the Commission’s wine cellar and cutlery . Lawyers on both sides will have a field day. \nAs the deadline approaches, an extension is not likely. Europeans will elect a new European Parliament in Spring 2019, a new Commission will take office later that year, and a new multiannual budget will start in 2020. The 27 will want to get Brexit out of the way before a new institutional cycle starts. \nSo the negotiating horizon will be much, much shorter than 24 months – perhaps 18 months or less – and the issues to be resolved are deeply divisive. And this assumes two big ifs: that no event in the next two years will throw the talks off course and that the political climate is favourable. \nThe UK and EU can hardly be faulted for being meticulous in the negotiations. This is what voters, parliaments and the courts expect. But the time constraints mean that the perfect will be the enemy of the good. Crashing out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be the hardest Brexit imaginable. Inside the Article 50 pressure cooker, someone will have to carry a watch. \nRem Korteweg is a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform More about: ",

    "text": "If you're a young person about to enter the job market, the skills you have already may give you more job mobility than you think — as long as you're in the right \"job cluster\". \nThat's one of the main takeaways from a new report from the Foundation for Young Australians (FYA). \nIt found the skills you get from working in one job could on average be transferred to 13 other positions. The report suggests in the future young people should be focusing on their strengths and interest areas rather just the one dream job. \nThe report, The New Work Mindset, looked at 2.7 million job ads. FYA used an algorithm to look at more than 1,000 occupations, and found there were seven large job clusters based on similar skills sought by employers. \nThe clusters are: The Artisans (builders and maintainers) The Generators (sellers and servers) The Coordinators (balance the books and do repetitive tasks) The Informers (teach and provide information) The Designers (use expertise to construct or engineer things) The Carers (improve the wellbeing of others) The Technologists (understand and manipulate digital technology) Photo: Young people should look at job clusters that best fits their interests and strengths, the report says. (Supplied) \nThe \"carers\" cluster, for example, contains 131 occupations; everything from GPs, to childcare workers, to fitness instructors. \n\"I think this gives a new insight into how these groupings can really help you,\" FYA chief executive Jan Owen said. \n\"It should give young workers confidence that they do have skills and capabilities, even if they go in through one entry-level job, it could unlock a whole lot of others.\" Do you know more about this story? Email Your first job won't necessarily be your last \nLucy MacKinnon is 25 years old and her job path is a perfect example of how the clusters work. \nShe graduated in 2013 with a degree in civil engineering. She thought she'd be designing suburban traffic layouts. Instead, her career has taken off as an airport planner. \n\"Finding a job out of university is actually really hard,\" she said. \n\"So if you get a job offer and it's not perfect, it's nice to know that what you learn in that job or what you've learned at university you can then use further on in life in something you might enjoy more.\" Photo: Lucy MacKinnon says people shouldn't worry too much if they don't get their dream job after uni. (ABC News: Norman Hermant) \nHer advice to those entering the job market is this: be aware of your skills. And remember, your first job won't be your last. \n\"Not having to lock yourself in, and knowing there's other options you're capable of doing, I think that will be really comforting for a lot of people.\" \nEleanor West, 17, is planning to study physiotherapy at university next year, but said she expected her work life would not be settled for long. \n\"Nowadays it's not common to get into a job and stay in it,\" she said. \n\"I think it's important to have skills that … are flexible, so that when we do move around, they can be adapted as well.\" Are employers hiring for skills and not experience? \nConvincing those employers to give more consideration to skills and capabilities as opposed to simply a job title is a challenge, according to Sally Morgan from recruiting giant Randstad. \n\"It is about shifting that 'we want somebody who's done this role for three years' [mentality],\" she said. \n\"As we see the future of work evolve, I think they'll be left with no choice. \n\"We're noticing that there are similar skill sets that are transferrable.\" So which cluster is for you? \nSome of job clusters have a brighter future than others. \nThe report said the Artisan cluster — the builders and maintainers — was the most likely to be affected by automation, and had the lowest prospect for growth. \nThe Technologists cluster — the digital technology specialists — will grow the most. \nBut even in low growth clusters, all is not lost. \n\"Even if you're in a job where it might be being automated, you don't understand until you look at the skills and capabilities how portable they are,\" FYA's Ms Owen said.",

Their three-month-old baby takes vacations with the couple, is spotted at the airport with the couple but Shahid is very particular to protect the tiny tot from flashbulbs. As Shahid returned to town with 'baby wife' Mira and his daughter Misha, we again spotted them at the airport. And this time too we longed to see at least a glimpse of the baby, but we failed.

(This does not include those dedicated football fans who have been making the trip regularly for years. You are true and loyal and deserving of respect.)\nThis is a new and soul-shaking approach for me, as since 1968 I have never put any fault on the fans through the insanity that often revolves around this city's gridiron. Years ago, I was a season subscriber for almost a decade — so I know, Double Blue folk, I know.\nBoutique sport The new paradigm hit me while reading stories about ticket sales for Sunday's Grey Cup, perhaps the last to be held around these parts for a long while.

This has happened at many previous Cups, especially here and in Vancouver, but it's never been done for a stadium with only 35,000 seats.\nToronto Grey Cup tickets prices slashed Here's the deal — Toronto is not, and has not been for around 25 years, a football town.\nWhy is complicated, but it includes a stupidly shortsighted local TV blackout rule in the 1970s and 1980s that sent an entire generation of Toronto fans to the NFL, plus endless poor ownership decisions and a growing feeling among locals that our game was second class.\nBack in 1976, one season before Major League Baseball came to the shores of Lake Ontario, the Argos drew an average of 47,354 fans, with a high of 50,212. In 1981, the average was 33,175 per, with a high of 38,225. It was downhill from there.\nCFL football in Toronto, once second only to the Leafs here, has become a boutique sport, loved by a small, though enthusiastic, group of supporters — almost entirely on television.\nYou're not cool — but that's OK Young Toronto fans are going to the pro parks and arena in greater numbers these days to see the Blue Jays, Raptors and Toronto FC, and certainly the Argo managers need to find a way to get some whippersnappers of their own.\nFootball fans can help in a big way by stopping the excuses and getting involved.\nThere are none that resonate anymore.\nYou can't complain about the stadium being lousy. Yes, Rogers Centre was terrible for football when it was half full, but BMO Field is an absolute gem. You should see it. Few of you have.\nArgo games more fan-friendly but still lacking You can't complain it's hard to get to when Toronto FC fans (an average of 26,583 this year) don't see it as a problem. They show up, even when there was construction all around this summer, and the Go Train was delayed because of the heat, and the Bathurst streetcar had turned into hot buses, and parking was a problem.\nYou can't whine about the team being lousy. Yes, the Argos went 5-13 this year, but they were 10-8 in 2015. They won the Grey Cup in 2012. That's not a long time ago.\nAlso, week one this year drew 24,812 at BMO Field to see Toronto lose. Three weeks later, only 12,373 came by when the club was 2-1. What, the great new stadium and a winning record were too confusing?\nStop complaining the team isn't \"cool\". Neither are you. You're a CFL football fan in a town where that's equivalent to being the guy who wears an ugly Christmas sweater in February. The Raptors are cool. Toronto FC is cool. The Blue Jays are cool, but they weren't until the 2015 trade deadline. Things change in a hurry.\nDon't tell everyone you're waiting for the NFL. The National Football League is not coming. Evah. It's going to London, or St. Louis again, or anywhere but here after the \"Bills in Toronto\" disaster.\nFinally, don't use the excuse there's no atmosphere at the games because \"nobody goes.\" Yeah, like you. How about sucking it up, taking a page from Toronto FC fans, and starting a supporter's club for the south end zone? Make noise. Have fun.\nGet away from your TV. Put some effort in.",

    "text": "School bus driver in fatal crash that killed six kids tests negative for drugs and alcohol Bus driver in crash that killed six kids tests negative for drugs THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Johnthony Walker arrested after a school bus from Woodmore Elementary in Chattanooga, Tennessee has overturned killing six children. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  43 AM \nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — A school bus driver had no drugs or alcohol in his system when he careened off a road and smashed into a tree, killing six elementary schoolchildren, police said Wednesday. \nChattanooga Police Sgt. Austin Garrett said a toxicology test was performed on Johnthony Walker, 24, the bus driver now in jail on five vehicular homicide charges. \nLater Wednesday, the police department said in a statement that a sixth child had died of injuries from the crash and another vehicular homicide charge would be added. \nFederal authorities said Walker left the designated bus route and had driven onto a curvy road while carrying 37 children on their way home from Woodmore Elementary School. \nSixth child in Chattanooga bus crash dies, police say \nPolice said he was driving well over the posted 30 mph limit when he lost control of the bus and slammed into a tree. Five children remain in the hospital. \nNational Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A. Hart says it's unclear why driver Walker left the designated route and drove the bus down Talley Road. \n\"One of the things we're exploring is A, has he done it before, and B, if so, why?\" Hart said. \nHe said Walker, who has no criminal record in the state, had taken on a second job at an Amazon Fulfillment Center, and part of the agency's investigation will look at whether fatigue played a role in the wreck. \nDriver in Tenn. school bus crash involved in crash 2 months ago \nThe NTSB will also bring in a specialist to analyze video and audio recordings from the bus's interior cameras that were damaged in Monday's wreck. \nPolice disputed one woman's claim that the driver asked the children if they were \"prepared to die\" just before the wreck. Jasmine Mateen, whose 6-year-old daughter was among the dead, said one of her two surviving children who were on the bus told her about the driver's remarks. \nGarrett, however, said at a Wednesday press conference: \"I want to be very clear on this. No witness we have spoken with has that information or provided it directly to our investigators.\" \nHe added that investigators have not yet interviewed the children on the bus and asked anyone with additional information to bring it to police. \nFamilies identify four girls and boy killed in Tenn. bus crash \nThree of the children killed were in fourth grade, one in first grade and another in kindergarten, said Kirk Kelly, interim superintendent of Hamilton County schools. The age and identity of the sixth child wasn't immediately released. A makeshift memorial to them grew up around a telephone pole, with stuffed bears, flowers and dozens of balloons. \nTheir families remembered them as fun, happy children taken much too soon. A school bus from Woodmore Elementary in Chattanooga, Tennessee has overturned. (Chattanooga Fire Department) \nD'Myunn Brown liked to play little tricks on grown-ups. The 6-year-old would snatch a cellphone, hide it, then giggle and bat his big brown eyes. \n\"That's what made him so pretty, and he was as sweet as he could be,\" said his great-grandmother, Winifred Bray. \"I'm still numb. I still can't believe he's gone.\" \nLaFrederick Thirkill remembered his 9-year-old cousin, Cordayja Jones, as a girly-girl who liked dressing up and giving hugs. \nThirkill is the principal at Orchard Knob Elementary, where Cordayja attended before changing schools to Woodmore Elementary. \nShe was a polite little girl, he said. Even though he was her cousin, she called him \"Mr. Thirkill\" when she saw him in the hallways. \n\"I remember her as just a kid who always smiles,\" he said. \nSchool officials repeatedly declined to answer questions Wednesday about whether they received complaints about the driver. School Principal Brenda Adamson-Cothran said their focus is on \"giving our families and students the support that they need in this tragedy.\" \nWalker was involved in another bus accident only two months ago, police said. In September, he was driving the bus into a blind curve when he crossed over the center line and hit an SUV, according to a police report. No one was injured, and the damage to both vehicles was minor. He was not cited for any violations. \nHamilton County School District spokeswoman Amy Katcher referred all questions about his performance and that of other drivers to the company that manages them, Durham School Services. \nThe bus company did not respond to questions about its safety record or Walker's employment history. Durham CEO David A. Duke released a video statement expressing condolences to the families and pledging to work with investigators. \nA mother and 8-year-old son, who was injured in the crash, filed a lawsuit against Durham on Wednesday, attorney Herbert Thornbury confirmed. He said the boy suffered minor injuries, watched his best friend die and has been crying uncontrollably ever since. The lawsuit contends the boy may be permanently injured, sustained pain and suffering and will incur medical and other expenses as a result of the wreck. \nBased in Warrenville, Illinois, Durham operates about 13,700 vehicles across the U.S. and has nearly as many drivers, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. \nThe company has had 346 crashes over two years, including three resulting in deaths and 142 with injuries, federal figures show. During that period, it had 53 incidents involving unsafe driving violations. Join the Conversation:",

    "text": "Canterbury mental health services 'stranded' at Princess Margaret Hospital CATE BROUGHTON Last updated 18:34, November 29 2016 IAIN MCGREGOR/FAIRFAX NZ \nMental health services remain stranded at the earhquake-prone Princess Margaret Hospital while debate continues about where they should go. \nMothers with postnatal depression, mentally-unwell children and those with eating disorders serious enough to need hospitalisation have been \"stranded\" at Princess Margaret Hospital. \nThese mental health services were left out of a restructure proposal in 2012, which saw most PMH services moved to other hospitals, documents show. \nEmails between Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) chief executive David Meates​ and Ministry of Health officials released under the Official Information Act to Labour reveal a drawn-out dispute over the future of the services. EMMA DANGERFIELD/FAIRFAX NZ \nCanterbury District Health Board chief executive David Meates says clinicians are worried it will be more difficult to ensure clinical safety while mental health services remain at Princess Margaret Hospital. \nA child and youth inpatient unit, eating disorders unit, mothers and babies mental health service and regional community mental health teams remain at PMH after other services moved as part of the Christchurch hospitals redevelopment. \nPlans to move mental health services from PMH have been left in bureaucratic limbo. The CDHB will have to come up with at least $30 million to relocate the services, the emails show. \nREAD MORE: * Government to fund several mental health packages worth millions for Canterbury JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nDavid Meates, chief exective of Christchurch District Health Board, left, Jonathan Coleman, Minister of Health, Bryan Spinks, Burwood Hospital project director, and Michael Hundleby, acting national director, during a visit to Burwood Hospital. \nAn original business case for the hospitals redevelopment prepared by the CDHB in 2012 included the relocation of PMH-based mental health services to the Christchurch Hospital Parkside building. \nIn February, Meates told director general of mental health John Crawshaw the final business case submitted to Cabinet had cut the planned move without the CDHB's knowledge. \n\"These services are now stranded at PMH site and will require additional operational resources to maintain them on what will be an empty site. Concerns are being raised by the clinicians as it will be more difficult to ensure clinical safety,\" Meates wrote. \nAbout 31 patients from three specialist mental health services and staff remain at the earthquake-damaged facility. Ad Feedback \nCritical structural weaknesses were identified in the hospital buildings after the 2011 earthquake, and engineers recommended making seismic upgrades. The decision was made to keep services at the facility only until they could be moved. \nMinistry of Health projects director Michael Hundleby said in a statement to Stuff the original plan was \"not being progressed … as there is not the space to accommodate [the services]\" at Christchurch Hospital. \nThe emails show Meates raised the issue of relocation multiple times, often highlighting the urgency of the situation. \n\"There is a real urgency required to review options, models of care and potential funding options,\" he wrote to Hundleby in July. \nIn December 2015, the ministry's capital investment committee chairman, Evan Davies, told CDHB chairman Murray Cleverley​ in a letter that a \"two-step\" business case would need to be developed by the CDHB as the project would cost over $15m. \nDavies' letter made it clear the cost would be born by the health board. \n\"There is no Crown funding, so it will need to come from CDHB's baseline resources or the Earthquake Repairs Programme of Works,\" he wrote. \nAn independent \"clinical review of the proposed models of care and options\" for the services was requested. \nIn another letter to Crawshaw, Meates said a wide range of temporary and permanent options costing \"from $30m upwards\" had been explored, including using Burwood and Christchurch hospitals, the temporary police station or various locations at Hillmorton Hospital. \nIt would take 12 to 18 months to approve any of the options, with a longer timeline needed for temporary service arrangements in the interim, he said. \n\"Any requirement to retain these services on the remaining PMH facility needs to consider that the facility contains significant critical structural weaknesses and fragile infrastructure including sewage and water.\" \nMeates said minimum repairs were made to PMH over the past four years, \"under the clear basis that the facility was to be vacated as planned in the [original] detailed business case\". \nA CDHB business case sent to the Hospital Redevelopment Partnership Group (HRPG) in March was \"not formally considered … as a source of funds had not been identified\", Hundleby told Meates. \nNurses working at the affected services were not happy about working at PMH due to the lack of supportive infrastructure. \n\"We want to see a solution but there doesn't seem to be one in sight,\" New Zealand Nurses Organisation organiser Lynda Boyd said. \nCleverley said he was not on the board when the original business case was drafted and submitted. \nHe said work was being done on a business case for the relocation of those services, and all the options would be considered once that was completed. \nMeates declined to speak to Stuff about the situation. - Stuff",

As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.” Also Read: Fidel Castro Death: 9 Hollywood Stars Seduced by Cuban Leader \nTrump, meanwhile, took a different approach. \n“Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades,” Trump said. “Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.” \n“While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,” he said. \nCastro died on Friday night at age 90. He was president of Cuba from 1976 to 2008, when he stepped down to allow his brother to take power. He was previously prime minister from the Communist revolution in 1959 to 1976. \nPresident Obama ended five decades of frozen U.S.-Cuba relations two years ago, reestablishing diplomatic relations with the Communist island. A 56-year economic embargo that has crippled Cuba financially remains in place. \nRead both Trump and Obama’s statements in their entirety below.

REUTERS/Vincent Kessler \nLONDON The European Parliament's top Brexit negotiator backed the idea of individual European Union memberships for Britons who want to stay in the bloc in an interview published on Saturday. \nFormer Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, a European federalist and arch-foe of eurosceptics said there were legal obstacles - but in principle he supported individual EU memberships for Britons, paid by annual fee. \n\"Many say 'we don't want to cut our links'. I like the idea that people who are European citizens and saying they want to keep it have the possibility of doing so,\" he told the Times. \nAndrew Bridgen, a pro-Brexit British member of parliament, said Verhofstadt's comments were designed to divide Britons and undermine June's vote to leave the EU. \n\"The truth is that Brussels will try every trick in the book to stop us leaving,\" he told the Times. \nThe European Parliament will have a limited role in the detailed negotiations with British Prime Minister Theresa May, once she formally launches the process triggered by the June 23 referendum vote to leave the bloc. \nBut members of European Parliament will have to pass legislation to enact a divorce, and possibly other agreements. \nEarlier this week, Verhofstadt said the European Parliament would not accept an agreement for Britain's exit from the European Union that would endanger any of the four EU freedoms, including the freedom of movement of people. \n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by Alexander Smith) Next In UK",

Regulators were concerned about infections possibly linked to contaminated instruments called duodenoscopes, used to examine the small intestine, and about the spread of uterine cancer when a surgical device called a power morcellator, which cuts up tissue, is used.\nAdvertisement\nLast month, the agency disclosed the inspection reports, showing that 15 of the 17 medical centers were either late in reporting cases in which patients were harmed by various devices or failed to report at all. The FDA inspection reports also disclosed other lapses.\nDr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA’s center for devices and radiological health, said in an Oct. 24 blog post on the agency’s website that the problems identified at these hospitals are hardly unique and, in fact, are widespread.\nThe Food and Drug Administration, device makers, and hospitals have been criticized for failing to act quickly when it appears a device may cause a threat. The FDA depends on hospitals to help identify new safety problems with devices and to report upswings in previously recognized problems.\nView Story Right procedure, wrong patient There are at least 14 instances since 2011 in which caregivers at Mass. facilities have performed a procedure on the wrong patient.\nA list of mistaken medical procedures\nAgency inspectors found that Mass. General failed to report the deaths of two patients, one of whom suffered a heart attack in the emergency department. The FDA withheld certain details from the reports, including descriptions of the devices involved — though Mass. General executives said the agency examined cases involving duodenoscopes as well as other devices.\nMass. General executives said a monitor was involved in the emergency department patient’s death, but said they could not provide more information because of patient privacy concerns. The FDA said the hospital also failed to report a patient injury and was late in reporting the deaths of two surgery patients and an injury to another patient.\nAdvertisement\nDr. Elizabeth Mort, senior vice president of quality and safety, said Mass. General has a strong history of bringing forward device problems, but the FDA “is widening the net’’ of incidents that hospitals must report to the agency, manufacturers, or both. The FDA “may be able to draw conclusions that one institution cannot draw,’’ she said.\nHospitals are required to report within 10 days information that “reasonably suggests that a medical device has or may have caused or contributed to’’ a serious injury or death of a patient.\nOver the two-year period the FDA examined, Mass. General submitted seven mandatory reports, plus 72 voluntary reports about concerns with devices that did not involve patient harm, Mort said.\nIn cases cited by the agency, the hospital did not report them because “we didn’t necessarily think the device caused the problem,’’ Mort said. For example, a monitor did not detect that the patient had a pacemaker but it was not designed to do so, Mort said.\n“They want us to report problems even when the device worked perfectly,’’ she said. “They are ramping up surveillance. If the design could be improved, the FDA wants to know about it.’’\nThe January report from the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions listed Mass. General as one of the hospitals with patient infections tied to contaminated duodenoscopes, which is apparently why the FDA inspected the hospital.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nThe Worcester campus of UMass Memorial Medical Center.\nMort said that in late 2014 and early 2015, Mass. General reported concerns about the device to the manufacturer and stopped using it. But in the end, extensive testing by the hospital was unable to tie patient infections to the instruments, despite the report’s initial conclusion.\nThe FDA faulted the Brigham for failing to report the death of one patient and for submitting four reports on patient injuries late. The patient, who died in December 2013, had undergone a procedure 18 months earlier with a power morcellator, often used during hysterectomies to shred tissue and extract it through small incisions.\nThe risk of morcellation was brought to public attention by Dr. Amy Reed. Soon after undergoing a hysterectomy at the Brigham in October 2013, follow-up tests on the removed tissue showed that she had an aggressive cancer, and that the cancerous tissue had been spread throughout her abdominal cavity during the surgery, sparking advanced cancer. She and her husband, Dr. Hooman Noorchashm, have fought an aggressive battle against morcellation and the hospital.\nBrigham spokeswoman Erin McDonough said the hospital contacted the FDA by phone in March 2014 about the patient’s death and Reed’s case but did not believe they met the criteria for mandatory reporting.\n“The device functioned as expected and was used in the way it was intended, although with unintended and tragic consequences,’’ she said in an e-mail. The FDA later issued a clarification, saying that such cases should be reported, and discouraged the use of morcellators through a safety advisory.\nThe four reports regarding injuries involved cardiac patients, McDonough said. But she said one case did not need to be reported and a second had misstated the date of the incident and was actually filed on time.\nThe FDA findings at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester included failure to report infections in patients who had undergone a procedure with a duodenoscope. Three of those patients later died, but two of the patients had complicated illnesses, the FDA report said.\nTimothy Tai for The Boston Globe\nDr. Dominic Nompleggi, chief of gastroenterology at UMass Memorial, said 14 patients developed infections. But he said the hospital was never able to find the same bacteria on the scopes, and therefore could not definitively link them to the infections. He said UMass Memorial reported the cases to Massachusetts public health officials but did not believe it also had to tell the FDA.\nHospitals use hundreds of medical devices, including imaging machines, heart testing devices, and in-vitro tests to make diagnoses; infusion pumps, ventilators, and robotics to provide treatment; and an array of implants to replace diseased joints and organs.\nChris Lavanchy, engineering director in the health devices division of ECRI Institute, a Pennsylvania-based patient safety organization, said over-reporting of incidents is also a problem. Hospitals report numerous cases in which it’s unclear if the device was related to the patient injury, making it hard for the FDA to untangle problems. Investigations become even more challenging when the injury involves the spread of cancer or infection, which can occur days or even years after the procedure.\nThe FDA did not take further action against the hospitals because it said they were all trying to improve reporting practices.\nSpokeswoman Deborah Kotz said the agency recognizes “it may not be immediately apparent to health care providers that a patient’s exposure to a device may have caused or contributed to that patient’s death.’’\n“Nevertheless, the FDA considers hospital reporting of device-related patient deaths and serious injuries to be critical to improving the safety of medical devices and improving patient care overall,’’ she said in an e-mail.\nLiz Kowalczyk can be reached at kowalczyk@globe.com .",

By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: November 28, 2016 12:20 PM The authority has ordered 86 of six coach trains from Korea’s manufacturer. The new trains will be seen on two routes. (Reuters) \nDelhi Metro riders are up for a treat as DMRC is all set to unveil its brand new, more efficient and faster metro trains in the coming year. These trains will be opened for commuters in March. The authority has ordered 86 of six coach trains from Korea’s manufacturer. The new trains will be seen on two routes. The first one being Magenta Line and the other being the Pink Line. While the former (Magenta line) connects Botanical Garden and Janakpuri West, the later (Pink Line) connects Mukundpur and Shiv Vihar. However, according to DMRC, it would not be possible to integrate the trains with the existing ones. These are state-of-the-art trains and are driverless. Aside from this, the trains will have several other new features. Check them all out: \n1. Driver-less trains \nThe trains have a mode which enables them to run unattended. The mode however would be run by an operator initially – the mode would be put under trail for an year or so but eventually, the trains will go completely unattended. \n2. More spacious \nThe coaches in the new Korean trains are wider than the existing ones and the technical equipments too have been moved under the seat increasing the carrying capacity of the train from 1780 to 1866 per train, according to a report in HT. \n3. Faster \nThe new trains will be 10% faster than the existing ones. Moreover, since the distance between two trains can be less, the trains would be able to run at the frequency of 90 seconds as against the current frequency of two minutes and 10 seconds. \n4. Digital Screens \nAll the coaches in the new trains will have a fully programmable LCD screens which can be used for playing advertisements and flashing route maps. \n5. Energy Efficient \nThe new design will lower the energy consumption by 20% with the help of the new technologies such as LED saloon lights, automatic dimming facility based on ambient light and energy efficient air conditioning system controlled by inverter. \n6. In addition to this, the metros will have coloured seats, wifi connectivity, USB ports and backrest support for wheelchair users.  ",

Sections of the parkway will close next month for a year so that the road can be raised to the level of Kingshighway, making it easier to navigate the area. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \nA chunk of Forest Park Parkway west of Kingshighway is set to close Dec. 5 for up to a year as part of a $10 million project to create a \"traditional intersection\" between the two thoroughfares, according to Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \nForest Park Parkway, which currently runs underneath Kingshighway Boulevard near the BJC Healthcare campus, will be raised to connect and be at-grade with Kingshighway. \nLocal traffic west of the construction won't be affected and Kingshighway will be open in both directions. The existing Kingshighway bridge over Forest Park Parkway will be left in place and filled underneath, the hospital said. \nThe project had been set to start in July, but was delayed. The city said about 17,000 drivers use that stretch of Forest Park Parkway a day. \nForest Park Parkway currently runs under Kingshighway, which can make it difficult for drivers to get to Barnes-Jewish Hospital, as well as to the Central West End and Forest Park, the hospital said. \nThose headed east on Forest Park can't turn onto northbound Kingshighway. Drivers on Kingshighway can't get to westbound Forest Park Parkway from either direction. \nConstruction is to be done overnight, between 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. Kingshighway will be open during the day, but some lane closures are expected overnight. Forest Park Parkway between Kingshighway and Euclid Avenue will be limited to just one lane in each direction. \nAnd of course, it will mean detours for those who use Forest Park Parkway to travel through the area. \n\"That's my east-west link,\" said Joe Gallo of University City. He said he'll rely more on Highway 40 (Interstate 64), which he's not keen to do. \nIt's hoped the project will make the intersection of Forest Park and Euclid, where many pedestrians cross, safer as well. Now, faster eastbound traffic coming from beneath Kingshighway mixes there with slower eastbound vehicles. \nThe Barnes-Jewish north expansion is set to open in August, which the hospital says will substantially increase the number of patients comng to the north end of the campus. The new intersection should be safer for pedestrians and reduce the crisscrossing of vehicles on Forest Park Parkway near Euclid. \nFunding for the project is funded comes from a $2.5 million federal grant for work on the Forest Park Parkway bridge over the MetroLink tracks west of Kingshighway, as well as $5 million from BJC and $2.5 million from Washington University School of Medicine. \nLeah Thorsen • 314-340-8320",

    "text": "Wealthy seen snaring a $21 billion gift with Trump tax overhaul Bloomberg 5 hrs ago Simone Foxman NEW YORK — Some of the wealthiest families in the U.S. are hoping for a $21 billion benefit from President-elect Donald Trump next year.\nThey and their businesses are re-evaluating, or putting on hold, strategies for transferring money to heirs as the new administration could work with a cooperative Congress to reform or repeal federal estate and gift taxes among its early moves. That would be an about-face from President Barack Obama, who sought to place tighter restrictions on the way wealth could be passed from generation to generation.\n“Eliminating the death tax will equate to an enormous gift,” said Peter Rup, who manages about $900 million for rich families at Artemis Wealth Advisors in New York. The IRS collected $21 billion from taxes on estates and gifts in its fiscal year 2016, according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department.\nTrump is gearing up to embark on the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades. His proposals include cutting income and corporate taxes and eliminating the so-called death tax, which is paid primarily by the richest 10 percent of earners, according to the Tax Policy Center. Advisers to wealthy families and their offices also anticipate that the new administration’s approach to estate and gift taxes could negate rules they were bracing for, which sought to limit tax breaks on transferring wealth.\nWealthy families sometimes use a discount strategy to pass on shares in their privately owned businesses and family offices — that is, firms that handle the financial affairs of a single family and are often structured as partnerships or limited liability companies. Families often took a discount of 20 percent to 45 percent on the value of the stakes to save on taxes, according to a report by law firm White & Case LLP. The Obama administration tried for years to curtail the benefit through legislation without success and instead in August proposed rules through the Internal Revenue Service set to do just that.\nThe proposed change was met by objections not only from some of the country’s wealthiest individuals but also from trade organizations like the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Both organizations have many members who own family businesses.\nFamily enterprises of all kinds are now optimistic that the new administration will halt the IRS effort. Under the new president, any such rules “could be pulled,” said John Olivieri, a White & Case lawyer who works with wealthy families.\nUnder current law an individual can leave up to $5.45 million to heirs without paying federal gift or estate tax. Above that threshold, the tax is assessed at a 40 percent rate. Married couples can shield estates worth as much as $10.9 million from the tax this year.\nTrump’s tax changes already appear to be on the fast track. A week after the election, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told House Republicans to be ready to move on sweeping legislation next year and mentioned taxes among the items. On Nov. 15, Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who chairs the House tax-writing panel said discussions were already in the works.\nGiven the prospect for sweeping tax reform, wealth advisers are telling clients to hold off on making large wealth transfers until there’s more clarity about the rules. They’re also advising them to take steps before year-end to defray taxes by, for example, booking investment losses now.\n“More than ever, any income, including investment income, that can be deferred to 2017 should be,” Nicholas Bertha, director of wealth and trust planning at Fieldpoint Private, wrote in a client advisory after the election. “Discretionary deductions, on the other hand, should be accelerated to this year.”\nTrump’s plan would replace the estate tax with a capital gains tax on the appreciation of inherited assets of more than $10 million, subject to some exemptions for small businesses and family farms.\nHe may face a difficult time ushering in a permanent end to the estate and gift taxes, even with Congress on his side. Under current rules, a permanent repeal would require 60 senators to agree. In 2017, Republicans will hold a thin majority of only 51 or 52 seats, depending on the outcome of Louisiana’s runoff election on Dec. 10.\nIn the meantime, advisers to high-net worth families on their trust and estate plans are re-evaluating.\n“Estate planning and gifting strategies will still be extremely important,” said Ida Liu, managing director and global market manager to the metro New York region for Citi Private Bank. “But certain types of trusts may be more or less favorable going forward if the estate tax is repealed or restructured.”\nGo to MSN Home",

When the pressure is weak it can split in two with the second pocket of cold air being pushed southwards.",

    "text": "Follow us Bring back the bush! Why you should stop waxing your pubic hair and start having amazing sex Miranda Kane Monday 28 Nov 2016 7:00 am The bush basically trims itself (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nFull disclosure: I’m a Powermuff girl. \nMy bush is a full, Amazonian chaparral. \nIt is a coppice of mystery and wonder. \nMy pubis lies untouched by wax and razor and only the fairest may enter my dingly-dell. \nI, ladies and gentlemen, do not shave my pubes. What’s more, I wholeheartedly and thoroughly recommend it. \nCertainly, the occasional trim might be in order, but is there really a need to go ripping out your whole hinterland? Not in my experience. \nMany moons ago, I did try. \nI went through six months of waxing and completely clearing my under-thicket. No strips, no Brazilians, just go bare or go home. \nBear in mind that, as a sex-worker, I would have had several more tourists to my national park than the average garden. \nDo you know how many people noticed it? \nCan you give me a rough estimate of how many men said ‘Golly gosh, I appreciate such a smooth pasture?’ \nNone. Zero. Nada. Absolutely no-one. (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nIn fact, I got complaints. They had come to frolic in my Yosemite, and all they got was a rather dull rock-garden. \nI can’t say I wasn’t relieved. I’d been through my fair share of razor rashes, ingrown hairs and weeks of squirming on the seat of a Tube train in order to scratch it just right as the hairs grew back. \nIt was a constant inconvenience and discomfort and it was boring. \nThe whole process of doing it was boring. The sex was boring. The regrowth was boring. \nThe only highlight was when, during a wax, I got accidentally fingered by the beautician. \nAlthough that then led to some severe thrush after the stray dollop of moisturiser sent my ph balance into a tailspin. \nSo why has this torture been inflicted on us? And by ‘us’, I don’t mean just women – although we do bear the brunt of it. \nMen are feeling the need to go at their gonads too, but I can see why – the myth that ‘It’ll make my junk look bigger’. \nYes, because we’re into you just for your peen. (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nThat’s why we have taken up so much time on the internet saying how much we luuuurve dick pics. \nNo. Stop that. \nAlthough at a family gathering, an in-law cried out that he would be disgusted if a girl didn’t shave her pubes off. \nI asked him how he could tell and he just said, ‘Well, on a date, I ask ‘em. Are you shaved or what, love?’ \nThis is a man who also thinks albinos are some kind of camel – just so you know that’s the level we’re dealing with. \nA bit of genitalia topiary should be a preference, not expected. \nAnd it certainly shouldn’t be the basis or ’make-or-break’ of any relationship. \nIf your partner desperately needs a reason to let you be in charge of your own body hair, here’s a quick run down. Why you should have a full bush \n1. Pubic hair collects pheromones – those lovely little particles that announce ‘Hello! I’m ready for sex, please!’. And is it just me, or do they smell good anyway? That lovely, musky scent that helps you remember what you were up to last night. \n2. They’re protection from bacteria. Hairs draw up moisture and protect your genitalia from things like thrush, and removing it leaves tiny open wounds that increase your chances of abscesses and infections. \n3. They increase sensation. At the end of each follicle is a nerve ending, so when you gently brush or breath over them, it gives you a tiny tingle to help stimulation. \n4. They’re natural, they’re supposed to be there. It’s a major hint from nature that, like pretty much all the other nifty things in and around your body, they have a job to do. Whether that job is warmth, cushioning, or just being a filter for picking out people who want to degrade you by insisting they have a say in what you do with your body hair. \n5. If you’re in a sexual relationship with someone who says things like, ‘The only hair I like is the hair on your head,’ then you’re going out with a dickhead. Seriously. Do not let them touch you. Do not give them the pleasure of your beautiful genitalia. Grab your coat, leave, do not pass go and seriously consider charging them £200 for the pleasure of your company. \nI think it’s also pertinent to remember that the only reason why they’ve been eradicated from porn is probably just due to camera angles. \nOnce upon a time, a humble pornographer realised as they were trying to get the perfect money-shot among flailing limbs and sweaty buttocks that, if only those pesky pubes weren’t in the way, they would get a better view. \nFortunately, no one is thrusting a camera between your legs. Sorry. \nObviously, some people have no say in their pubic hair growth for various reasons, and I’m certainly not ridiculing the sight of a bald mons pubis – just the effort and expectation that goes into it. \nI’ve read far too many articles that say, ‘It defines you as being a ‘Real Woman,’ which is a phrase that needs to die in a fire. \nIt’s basically up to you. \nIf you find yourself picking up a razor before a hot date, then think about why. \nAre you cropping it off for yourself, or because someone else thinks it’s expected? Can you really be bothered? \nAll I’m saying is that, if you find yourself staring into the face of a person who doesn’t give two hoots about your razor rash, regrowth and gets albinos confused with alpacas then it’s time to put down the razor and love your muff.

The government had implemented the Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO) 2013 in May 2013 based on the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy, 2011 which had expanded the span of price control to cap MRPs of as many as 348 essential medicines. This was a departure from the previous regime which had only 74 bulk drugs or key raw material under prices control. In 2015, the government further revised the price control order to bring more drugs under its purview. Currently, the government has fixed prices of around 850 essential medicines and is expected to cap prices of more drugs soon. As per the provisions of the DPCO 2013, to control the prices of essential medicines, the drug regulator National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has fixed the prices of medicines appearing in the list of essential medicines, Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers Mansukh L Mandaviya said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. \"The above action of the government has resulted in saving to the consumers to the tune of around Rs 5,060.30 crore, which includes medicines for critical diseases,\" he added. In a separate reply, the government said it has been taking a number of steps, including Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana , to make quality medicines available at affordable prices to patients. \"With a view of achieving the objective of making available quality medicines at affordable prices, the government has been taking several regulatory and fiscal measures from time to time,\" Mandaviya said. To provide further relief to the common man, a countrywide campaign for ensuring availability of quality generic medicines at affordable price for all under 'Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana' (PMJAY) has been started, he added. \"At present, there are 534 Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Kendras functioning in over 26 states/UTs,\" Mandaviya said. Bureau of Pharma PSUs of India, which is implementing PMJAY, is also buying generic medicines from private companies through open tendering process. More than 100 private manufacturers are providing generic medicines for the scheme, Mandaviya said. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

The court has set Nov 29 to hear the application. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:",

    "text": "Marine General James Mad Dog Mattis Might Be The Next Secretary Of Defense Chaps Email \nAsked by reporters if he would choose Mattis to lead the Defense Department, Trump said, “All I can say is he is the real deal. He is the real deal.” In Mattis, Trump has a candidate who was held in high regard throughout the ranks of the Marine Corps during his 44 years of service. A seasoned combat commander, he led a task force into southern Afghanistan in 2001 and a Marine division at the time of the Iraq invasion in 2003. \nThe retired four-star general, who was known as “Mad Dog,” was lauded for his leadership of Marines in the 2004 Battle of Falluja in Iraq — one of the bloodiest of the war. But he attracted controversy in 2005 when he said “it’s fun to shoot some people” while addressing service members in San Diego. \nGeneral Mattis might be the most beloved officer for Marines since Chesty Puller. I don’t know a single Marine who doesn’t love General Mattis. He was said to be too brazen to be the Commandant, but he is exactly the type of officer who you’d want to be with if you were going to war. Marines regard him as the perfect General officer for ground troops. \nIf President-Elect Trump does tap General Mattis to be the next SECDEF, we might as well change the title back to the Secretary of War, because Mad Dog doesn’t fuck around. Can he do the job well? Who knows. I know that he will be an absolute quote machine while trying to, though. \n“I don’t lose any sleep at night over the potential for failure. I cannot even spell the word.” \n“The first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event. That said, there are some assholes in the world that just need to be shot.” \n“I come in peace. I didn’t bring artillery. But I’m pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you fuck with me, I’ll kill you all.” \n“Find the enemy that wants to end this experiment (in American democracy) and kill every one of them until they’re so sick of the killing that they leave us and our freedoms intact.” \n“Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.” \n“You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didn’t wear a veil. You know, guys like that ain’t got no manhood left anyway. So it’s a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually, it’s quite fun to fight them, you know. It’s a hell of a hoot. It’s fun to shoot some people. I’ll be right up there with you. I like brawling.” \n“I’m going to plead with you, do not cross us. Because if you do, the survivors will write about what we do here for 10,000 years.” \nYeah. You gotta change the title back to Secretary of War if you pick General Mattis. He deserves it. Chaps",

The protests will affect 20 airports, including O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. (Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) \n\"Workers spanning the economy — including baggage handlers, fast-food cooks, home care workers, child care teachers and graduate assistants — will demand $15 and union rights, no deportations, an end to the police killings of black people, and politicians keep their hands off Americans' health care coverage,\" the group said in a press release announcing the strike. \nNYC transit workers warn of strike as they seek better pay \nOn a conference call regarding the protests, Betty Douglas, a McDonald's worker from St. Louis, Mo., and a member of \"Fight for $15,\" said that \"Americans are united around our desire for a better future for our kids and an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.\" Employees at McDonald’s restaurants from Detroit to Denver will participate in the protests. (Theodore Parisienne/for New York Daily News) \n\"We are also protesting to reject the politics of divisiveness that tears America apart by race, religion, ethnicity and gender. And we won't back down until the economy is fixed for all workers and we win justice for all people in our nation,\" she said. \nFight for $15 staged multiple protests over the course of the presidential campaign, including a demonstration of more than 1,500 people outside the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at Hofstra University. \nCurrently, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, which translates to just $15,080 a year for someone working 40 hours a week. That amount is below the federal poverty threshold for a family of two or more. Join the Conversation:",

As a mother, I do get worried about my children’s safety when they are out, because someone else might end up being careless.

Credit: West Yorkshire Police \nThomas Mair is being described as an extremist, a fanatic, an assassin – even ‘a constituent’. But make no mistake – he is a terrorist: Just like the 7/7 bombers who caused carnage on the London transport system in 2005; Just like the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby in south London in 2013. \nTerrorists don’t look a certain way. They don’t have a certain religion. They don’t have to shout ‘Allahu Akbar’ before launching their attack. What defines them is the political motives of their actions. \nMost media organisations have been reluctant to use ‘the T word’ to describe Mair: after all, it has a vague definition which means that many politically-charged criminal acts can be argued either way. \nBut the slaughter of a pro-European, pro-immigration politician during the EU referendum campaign by a white supremacist could hardly be more terroristic. Nazi history books at Thomas Mair's house. Credit: West Yorkshire Police \nThe killing of Jo Cox MP was not the consequence of a sudden, psychotic episode but the result of years of slow-building revulsion. As a community volunteer, ‘Tommy’ managed to hide his hate. \nBut receipts from the 1990s show he spent more than 600 dollars buying propaganda from a neo-Nazi group – including a munitions handbook. In 2000, he travelled to central London for a meeting of white supremacists where one attendee said he was “vitriolic”. \nDuring the sixteen years that have followed, Britain’s far right movement has grown. White supremacist groups seem to have gained confidence and attached themselves to concerns about immigration. Issues of the magazine of American white supremacist group National Vanguard found at Thomas Mair's house. Credit: West Yorkshire Police \nIn Britain and in many European countries, just as Islamist groups have expanded their recruitment programmes, far right organisations have been campaigning and protesting more effectively. \nCurrently around ten percent of all referrals to the government’s Prevent counter-radicalisation programme relate to the extreme right wing. And in some parts of the country, cases linked to neo-Nazism equals the number of referrals for Islamist extremism. \nWhat does this tell us? Alongside Islamist and Irish-related terrorism, the far right is the third threat for Britain’s intelligence agencies. And it’s growing.",

    "text": "A disabled woman may have lain dead in her bedroom for weeks while her sister and teenage daughter carried on living under the same roof. \nPolice discovered Sharon Greenop’s body decomposing in her bed after an anxious neighbour raised the alarm because of a putrid stench coming from the terraced home. \nIt is understood officers found 46-year-old Miss Greenop’s student daughter Shayla, 19, and her sister Lynnette still living in the house along with a host of animals, including a pair of tarantulas, rats, a rabbit, a blind cat and a three-legged sheepdog called Katie. \nDetectives immediately launched an investigation and are treating the death of Miss Greenop, who suffered from a debilitating neck injury which left her confined to a wheelchair, as ‘unexplained’. \nPolice discovered Sharon Greenop’s body decomposing in her bed, front, her daughter Shayla, top was still living in the house\nThey have sealed off the terraced house in Troon, Ayrshire, and uniformed officers have remained on round-the-clock guard since they were called to the property two weeks ago. \nLast night, a neighbour revealed he alerted the authorities after noticing a ‘horrendous smell’ coming from Miss Greenop’s room and speaking to Lynnette Greenop, who is thought to have acted as her sister’s carer. \nPhil Martin, 67, a registered childminder, said: ‘There seemed nothing untoward in the way they were living. The family is just Sharon’s sister Lynnette and her daughter Shayla and all the animals. \n‘About three months ago I asked Lynnette what had happened to Sharon as I hadn’ t seen her for a while and she said, “She’s taken to her bed but I don’t know what’s wrong with her. She’s just not making anything of it.” \n‘Then there was a horrendous smell coming from Sharon’s bedroom, which is back to back from ours, and a plague of bluebottles. I alerted the police two weeks ago tomorrow after the smell gradually got worse, but we were getting the smell for three weeks before that. \nSharon's student daughter Shayla, 19, right, and her sister Lynnette, pictured left with Shayla, were living alongside a pair of tarantulas, rats, a rabbit, a blind cat and a three-legged dog\n‘Initially it was in our spare bedroom and we checked everywhere and came to the conclusion it was not coming from our house. Plus there was a horrendous plague of bluebottles.’ \nMr Martin added: ‘Sharon was semi-paralysed and used crutches but when she went out anywhere it was in a wheelchair. I got on great with her. She had a prolapsed disc in her neck pressing on her spinal cord about five years ago. Before that she was fine.’ \nHe said the body had been removed from the house and driven away in a dark estate car with blacked out windows. He described Miss Greenop as ‘a nice soul’, adding: ‘She had a voice like a foghorn and a raucous laugh. If you didn’ t see her first you certainly heard her.’ \nIt is understood Sharon Greenop was a single mother and had always been unmarried. Mr Martin went on: ‘Shayla was saying on Facebook that she had finally tracked down her father. He’s never been about. I saw her just yesterday. She’s still walking about.’ \nHe added: ‘The police are saying they’ve never seen anything like it in such a quiet place as Troon.’ \nLast night, forensics teams continued to work inside the end-of-terrace property in Aldersyde Avenue, a quiet cul-de-sac on Troon’s Muirhead estate. \nThe Greenop family were well-known in the seaside town, and were a familiar sight walking the dog. One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘There have been rumours about what happened. Sharon used a commode then suddenly that appeared lying out the back door a few months ago. \n‘She had a care package and you used to see the TV flickering and the light from her window but they hadn’t been on for a while. There were warning bells.’ \nOfficers have been standing guard outside the house round-the-clock, and the property has been sealed off with police tape\nThe neighbour added: ‘Shayla’s a Goth and she’s just a strange girl but she doesn’t really speak. She has changed her name recently to Mallak. I know she’s been studying at Kilmarnock College and was doing catering at Ayr before that. \n‘The last Lynnette said she was working in a charity shop. She worked for South Ayrshire College in the kitchens of care homes.’ \nAnother elderly neighbour said he was shocked at developments. He said: ‘This is a quiet little street and there’s never been anything like this. You could smell a bad smell coming from along the houses but I didn’t think it would be something like that. It would never occur to you that this could happen.’ \nWhen asked to explain the bizarre circumstances surrounding her sister’s death, 38-year-old Lynnette Greenop told a local newspaper: ‘I am sorry but there will be no information given out whatsoever from our family just now until we know ourselves what is going on.’ \nShe earlier put out messages on Facebook thanking people who had been supportive ‘this last 8 to 9 days since the sudden death of my sister and mother to Mallak’ and attacking ‘rumour mill gossips that don’t even have the facts’. \nA spokeswoman for Police Scotland said: ‘At 4.20pm on Thursday, November 10, police discovered the body of a 46-year-old woman within a property in Aldersyde Avenue in Troon. \n‘The relatives of the woman have been informed. A post mortem examination has been carried out and officers are treating the death as unexplained and inquiries are ongoing.’",

Apple's ( AAPL , Tech30 ) chief design officer -- the creative genius behind some of the company's most successful products, including the iPod and iPhone -- was tasked with designing a Christmas tree for the prestigious Claridge's hotel lobby in London. \nKnown for simplicity, Ive took a similar approach with the tree. In fact, it doesn't have any decorations. It's just... a tree. \nWhile the tree is traditionally the hotel's main attraction -- after all, last year's creation by Christopher Bailey for Burberry included over 100 umbrellas and thousands of lights -- this year's inspiration comes from the environment around it. \n\nLight boxes project large black and white photos of snowy birch trees in the lobby. Other smaller unlit trees accompany the immersive installation that's meant to make visitors feel like they're walking through a forest. It's all displayed on \"a pure white floor.\" \nBut overall, the presentation isn't nearly as visual or high-tech as last year's display. \nIve teamed up with industrial designer Marc Newson for the project. The pair previously worked together in 2013 to create a customized grand piano and Leica digital camera in support of the HIV/AIDS charity (RED). \n\n\"There are few things more pure and beautiful than nature, so that was our starting point, layering various iterations of organic forms with technology,\" the duo said in a joint statement . \n\"Our aim was to create an all-enveloping magical experience that celebrates our enormous respect for tradition while recognizing our excitement about the future and things to come.\" \nBecause nothing says excitement about the future like a dark, unlit Christmas tree. \nCNNMoney (San Francisco) First published November 21, 2016: 5:05 PM ET",

    "text": "Fearing yet another witch hunt, Reddit bans ‘Pizzagate’   23 at 1:26 PM   An image of the Reddit note. \nCiting its policy against posting the personal information of others, Reddit has banned the “Pizzagate” conspiracy board from the site. Pizzagate, a persistent and popular conspiracy theory that combines the Clinton diaspora with accusations of a secret pedophile ring, has been a steady force in the enclaves of the pro-Donald Trump Internet for the past few weeks. \nIt has also led to some very real harassment of the people caught up in the theory, including the owner of the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria in the District, James Alefantis. Alefantis has received hundreds of death threats over the past couple of weeks, he told the New York Times this week, after Pizzagate enthusiasts decided that his restaurant was the secret headquarters of a child sex-trafficking ring run by Hillary Clinton and members of her inner circle. \nNone of the wildly accusatory claims are true. Alefantis told the Times that he asked Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube and the FBI to help him stop the spread of the conspiracy theory, which uses photos of his own kids as “evidence.” A Northwest Washington pizza restaurant is being targeted by online bullies spreading fake news about the owner. (WUSA) [ No, John Podesta didn’t drink bodily fluids at a secret Satanist dinner ] \nFor some parts of the Internet, the leak of stolen emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta provided an opportunity to scour for evidence of wrongdoing. As the Washington City Paper noted, that included a huge search for stronger ties between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Clintons. What those sleuths found instead were lots of references to pizza, which then led to speculation that the emails about pizza must be code for something bad. The theory made its way onto r/The_Donald, the huge, Trump-supporting subreddit, until the hunt spawned its on subreddit, r/Pizzagate, which quickly attracted a dedicated team of Internet investigators. \n“Pizzagate” has yet to produce any actual evidence for its extremely weighty and life-ruining accusations, but every debunking of its claims — including the one in the Times — has only convinced its believers that they must be right, and that the circle of pedophiles and sympathizers trying to cover up their findings must be even bigger and more powerful than they imagined. #reddit has banned the #pizzagate subreddit. \nPLEASE take a long, hard look at the narrative you're being spoon-fed, folks #censorship \n— Fran Seen 👻 (@FranSeenWrites) November 23, 2016 The only reason Kanye was hospitalized is because he spoke up about #pizzagate \n— Patrick (@_PaNew_) November 22, 2016 \nThe same goes for Reddit’s ban. In a post on r/The_Donald (the big subreddit dedicated to supporting Donald Trump) after the Reddit ban, one former moderator of the board dedicated to unraveling Pizzagate said that the “entire mod team and everyone else is tightening up our opsec and putting on our battle-armor.” \n“We have all made life insurance videos. We have all vowed to continue this fight. You have only increased our number. This morning we were numerous, tonight we are legion,” they wrote, promising that the hunt would soon return to the Web with a vengeance. For now, they’ve relocated to Voat, a popular Reddit alternative created in protest of Reddit’s enforcement of its rules. \nReddit does not generally ban conspiracy theories, or the boards dedicated to them, from their site just for existing. What crossed the line with Pizzagate was the repeated posting of private information on the boards from sleuths who believed they were identifying pedophiles or those working to help them. An r/The_Donald post from a moderator asked the board to immediately report any doxxing or personal information posted there in the wake of Pizzagate’s demise, to help spare their community from the same fate. \nAlthough Pizzagate began in a frenzy of wild accusations against Clinton in the days before the election, the conspiracy has only gained interest after Donald Trump’s victory. As it does, it’s drawing more and more public and private citizens into the fray. \nRead more:",

CHRIS MARTIN performs at the Global Citizen Festival at Central Park in Manhattan, New York.. (photo credit:ANDREW KELLY / REUTERS)   \nColdplay frontman Chris Martin spurred rumors of a potential concert in Israel with his surprise arrival Monday to Tel Aviv on a private jet. Hebrew Israeli media reported that the low-profile visit by the leading vocalist for the popular British band was scheduled until Tuesday.   Among Martin's reasons for visiting was to check the possibility of holding Coldplay's first performance in Israel this coming summer or in the summer of 2018, Channel 2 cited music industry sources as saying. For years, local producers have offered lucrative deals to entice the seven-time Grammy-winning band to rock out in Israel. Martin reportedly arrived for the quick trip to the Holy Land this week after performing for the first time in India for Coldplay's current 'A Head Full of Dreams' world tour.The April release of Coldplay's video for it's single \"Up&Up\" gained local notoriety as it was directed by the Israeli creative duo Vania Heymann and Gal Muggia. Martin has spoken highly of the video, referring to it as \"one of the best videos...ever made.\"   (Coldplay - Up&Up) Think  ",

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images \nTraining for months is passé. Everybody has been to a dialect coach or four. Aspirating fake cocaine until you have to be hospitalized is very 2013. The hot new way to full commit yourself to a role is to basically become a Catholic priest, and then if you still can’t get an Oscar nomination, what more could you have done? Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver both took a deep religious dive while preparing for Martin Scorsese's upcoming film Silence, which follows the tumultuous journey of two Jesuit missionaries searching for their mentor in 17th-century Japan. In a new New York Times profile, Garfield details his elaborate preparation for the role, culminating in a seven-day silence retreat at St. Bueno’s Jesuit house in Wales. “If I’d had ten years, it wouldn’t have been enough to prepare for this role,” Garfield tells the Times . “I got totally swept up in all things Jesuit and very taken with Jesuit spirituality. The preparation went on for nearly a year, and by the time we got to Taiwan, it was bursting out of me.” If a year of religious study doesn’t sound too emotionally taxing, clearly you’re underestimating the Hacksaw Ridge actor’s commitment. “On retreat, you enter into your imagination to accompany Jesus through his life from his conception to his crucifixion and resurrection,\" Garfield explains. \"You are walking, talking, praying with Jesus, suffering with him. And it’s devastating to see someone who has been your friend, whom you love, be so brutalized.”\nIn a very \"Christian Bale in The Machinist \" move, Driver also dropped an unbelievable amount of weight for the role. \"Fifty-one pounds,\" he says. \"It’s about control, and as an actor you want to have control.\" The co-stars arrived at their Jesuit retreat almost simultaneously but \"pledged to silence, the two actors waved when they spied each other in the refectory.\" As it turns out, Silence will get a 2016 release date after all, meaning these two could hypothetically go up against each other during awards season. Spiritually tortured brother against spiritually tortured brother: very Catholic. The Academy is going to love it.",

SWNS:South West News Service 1 Scott Rivers dressed up as Batman to give police information into suspected paedophiles he had been monitoring \nThe Ivybridge local delivered his latest dossier to police in Exeter in Devon on Monday, about an offender he calls “Mr Shy”, but received a “cease and desist” letter from cops the next day. \nThe masked crusader has vowed not to stop hunting paedophiles, claiming several of his targets have appeared in court thanks to his actions. \nHe said: “I don’t see myself as a vigilante – I am not attacking anyone, just passing on information to help people with their enquiries”. \nThe force said it was aware of Mr Rivers, who lives in Ivybridge, and his efforts to proactively try to entrap people by posing as a girl under the age of 16.

    "text": "Conjuring Movie Magic? Newt casts a tricky spell [Image: Warner Bros] \nThere is a very simple explanation for why the film makers didn’t include the Elder Wand’s iconic design. Let’s face it: alarm bells were already ringing in the minds of fans when they saw that poster of Graves holding the #DeathlyHallows symbol. And these hunches were justified even more when they guessed that the mysterious blond gentleman in the trailers was Johnny Depp. Including the Elder Wand in Fantastic Beasts would therefore have been a dead giveaway as to who the mysterious Graves really was. \nOf course, the omission of the Elder Wand may be by deliberate design. Who’s to say that, in the movie timeline, Grindelwald has yet to gain the Elder Wand? Dumbledore uses the Elder Wand [Image: Warner Bros] \nIn the Deathly Hallows novel, the renowned wand maker Mykew Gregorovitch acquired and studied the Wand of Destiny for years afterward to help improve his products - until Grindelwald steals the Elder Wand from him that is. JK Rowling doesn’t give any specifics as to how long Gregorovitch owns the wand, or when it was stolen from him, so this event may happen somewhere later in the Fantastic Beasts saga, which is now due to have five installments. \nBut this is also a bit of an unlikely theory. The Deathly Hallows novel and movie specify that Grindelwald was a young man when he stole the Elder Wand. Moreover, we've already seen a younger Grindelwald (portrayed by a fresh-faced Jamie Campbell Bower) steal the wand in the Harry Potter movies. Grindelwald makes off with his prize [Image: Warner Bros] \nBy the time of Fantastic Beasts in 1926, Grindelwald was roughly 43 years old, so either the wizarding definition of a ‘young’ is a little different than our own (they frequently live till over 100, after all), or Rowling and Co. are planning to perform a little ret-con of the Potter-verse. Maybe Grindelwald, for the convenience of the plot of the Fantastic Beasts saga, will now be a little bit older when he finally acquires the Elder Wand. \nThen again, the solution could very well have presented itself to us in Fantastic Beasts itself... The Question of Gellert Grindels-Wand The mystery of Grindlewald [Image: Warner Bros] \nIt’s clear that Grindelwald was very successful in assuming Percival Graves’s identity, since he was able to operate undetected by the MACUSA for at least several months prior to the main events of the movie. \nBut what happened to the real Graves and his wand? This is unclear for the moment, but it’s highly like that Grindelwald took Graves’s own wand when he either killed or incapacitated him. And for very good reason! \nThrough the course of the #HarryPotter series, we've already discovered how wands are used for identification purposes. During the Gringotts-Heist in The Deathly Hallows, Hermione, in the guise of Bellatrix Lestrange, attempts to gain access to the Lestrange vault by using her stolen wand. Complications soon ensue when they realize that the goblins are aware of the theft. A disguised Ron and Hermione [Image: Warner Bros] \nBut in Fantastic Beasts , the American witches and wizards of the twentieth century have taken this one step further: \n“Legislation introduced at the end of the nineteenth century meant that every member of the magical community in America was required to carry a ‘wand permit’, a measure that was intended to keep tabs on all magical activity and identify the perpetrators by their wands.” \nThis is evident in the Fantastic Beasts movie, in that small section where Tina Goldstein ( #KatherineWaterston ) takes Newt to get his wand registered following his arrest. After accosting him, Tina takes Newt to the MACUSA [Image: Warner Bros] \nAnd it’s doubtful that Grindelwald would want to take his own wand anywhere near the MACUSA. After all, as Ollivander said to #HermioneGranger : \n“[The Elder Wand has] certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognise [...]” \nIf anyone was searching for the Elder Wand, a MACUSA log of its details would easily give it away, as well as its owners’ disguise. Therefore, it would make sense for Grindelwald to hide his Hallow. Using Graves’s wand would help maintain his illusion and keep his ownership of the relic secret, as well as out of the MACUSA's hands. A young Dumbledore and Grindelwald [Image: Warner Bros.] \n“Do you think you can hold me?” Grindelwald asks Madam Picquery contemptuously during his arrest. She may think so, but a savvy audience knows that he’s going to escape, establish Nurmengard (if he hasn’t already) and cause a lot of trouble for Newt and his friends, as well as a certain Albus Dumbledore, who will be forced to intervene. \nWhatever the situation is with the dreaded Elder Wand, it’s going to be very exciting to see it play out during the deadly game between Dumbledore and Grindlewald. There truly is a lot of potential in the Fantastic Beasts series. Indeed, we’re set to see an important and oft-referred-to chapter of the Wizarding World unfold before our very eyes! Poll Where do you think the Elder Wand is? Hidden by Grindelwald, to be reclaimed and used. Still with Gregorovitch, and waiting to be stolen. I don't know! ",

    "text": "Dodge 2016 Dodge Challenger R/T Scat Pack \nI've always said the Dodge Challenger is the only big car that would make me cheat on my own little Miata, but that claim has been based on emotion. I'd never actually driven one, just admired them from afar. \nThat, my friends, has finally changed. Emme Hall/Roadshow \nI slipped behind the wheel of the 2016 Challenger Scat Pack at an old airstrip. Too impatient to worry about launch control, I slammed my foot on the skinny pedal on the right and held on to the wheel for dear life. The 6.4-liter V8 engine produced a glorious noise as the eight-speed automatic transmission blipped through the gears, and suddenly I was approaching the end of the runway at 140 mph. \nYowza. \nIt's been great to see the muscle car wars of the 1970s heat up in the new millennium. Ford, Dodge and Chevrolet have been pulling out all the stops, trying to turn their high-horsepower drag strip kings into machines that can also conquer the twisties. Emme Hall/Roadshow \nAt 485 horsepower and 475 pound-feet of torque, the Challenger Scat Pack lies below the crazy-pants 707-horsepower Challenger Hellcat. But the Hellcat starts at $64,195, and good luck finding one at that price as dealer markups have been a bit out of control. The Challenger R/T Scat Pack starts at a much more reasonable $37,995 and gets a cool drag-racing bumblebee badge. \nFrankly, I was surprised at the relative nimbleness of the Challenger. At 4,200 pounds, it's a relatively heavy beast, but it handles better than I expected. My test model arrived with the optional 20-inch forged-aluminum wheels, wrapped in 245/45Z all-season performance tires. It would be interesting to see how the Challenger would perform with some good Michelin Pilot Super Sport or Pirelli P Zero summer tires. \nOn rougher roads, the Challenger's ride quality suffers from its stiff Bilstein suspension. It's fine for daily driving, but I found myself avoiding broken pavement when I could. \nPower goes to the rear wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission, a $1,400 option over the standard six-speed manual. Although I always prefer the manual option, this ZF automatic shifts quickly on its own or lets you blip the paddle shifters in manual mode. In the Challenger, it enables cylinder deactivation, giving the car EPA fuel economy of 15 mpg city and 25 mpg highway, up to 2 mpg better than the manual.

    "text": "Subscribe in iTunes ∙ RSS feed ∙ Download ∙ Play in a New Tab Advertisement \nThis season on Working, we’re speaking to individuals employed in fields potentially imperiled by Donald Trump’s presidency. These are the stories of people doing difficult but important jobs—jobs that may get much more difficult and much more important in the years ahead. \n“My parents chose this country as their home, so I think about why they do that,” Nithya Nathan-Pineau says in this episode of Working. That speculation isn’t just personal for her, though—it’s also professionally resonant. \nToday, Nathan-Pineau serves as director of the Detained Children’s Program for the Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition , a nonprofit that provides legal services and other resources for those facing deportation. In that capacity, she and her colleagues work with hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. That name, as Nathan-Pineau puts it, is “kind of a misnomer” since the “vast majority” are already in deportation proceedings by the time CAIR connects with them. \n“Most of the kids we meet with have been apprehended in the last week,” Nathan-Pineau explains. “They have been transported across the country. They have no idea where they are.” CAIR aspires to bring those young people up to speed, helping them understand what’s going on and what their options might be. It also aims to match kids with pro bono lawyers in the area, who Nathan-Pineau mentors on the ins and outs of immigration law. Advertisement \nNathan-Pineau, for her own right, also has a small caseload of her own, which is important in part because CAIR has more young people in need of representation than it does volunteers. In the lead up to a hearing, she and her co-workers will often interview their clients over a period of months, trying to put together a narrative that lets them show a judge the “whole person” and not just a series of line items on an application. \nThey often end up confronting terrible stories of conflict along the way. “One of the hardest things about our job is interviewing kids about the worst moments of their lives—the most vulnerable, scariest, most horrible things that have happened to them,” Nathan-Pineau says. “That’s something that never gets easier.” \nThings don’t always work out, of course. “Having an attorney really increases the chance that a child will have a successful outcome in court, but we don’t win all of our cases,” Nathan-Pineau acknowledges. Knowing that, though, doesn’t make it easier to lose. “I think about the consequences for that individual,” she says. “That, for me, is the hardest part of this work.” \nThe election of Trump—whose inflammatory rhetoric about immigration powered his campaign—has only amplified the urgency of Nathan-Pineau’s efforts. “We’re experiencing a lot of fear. And our clients are experiencing a lot of fear, because there’s so much uncertainty about what’s to come,” she says, explaining that in the days immediately after the election, kids were already asking questions about it, worried that they’d lose their ability to pursue their own cases. \nThat fear lingers for now, even as Nathan-Pineau and her “sad but energized” staff are working out to educate and inform new audiences. “Our advice to people is don’t panic,” Nathan-Pineau says. “And know your rights.” \nIn a Slate Plus extra, Nathan-Pineau talks about CAIR Coalition’s relationship with the Office of Refugee Resettlement and describes the condition in its facilities.

The pulse-quickening, celebrity-filled catwalk event of the year : the Victoria’s Secret fashion show takes place in Paris with performances from Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. AP \nPARIS — The laciest, if not raciest, catwalk event of the year — aka, the Victoria’s Secret fashion show — took place Wednesday night in in the City of Light. Among the takeaways: performances by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars, sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid joining forces, as well as a $3 million Fantasy bra modelled by Jasmine Tookes. Here are the highlights of the Paris show: Angels in red \nGuests shuffled into the huge steel-and-glass atrium of Paris’ Grand Palais to the sound of a string orchestra playing softly from a huge Arc de Triomphe decor. \nThe calm lasted only a few seconds, however, and was broken by the flash of red neon lights and bold rock music blasting out to announce the start of the 40-minute presentation, which infected the cheering guests. ADVERTISEMENT \nSwedish model Elsa Hosk strutted out fittingly with electric energy in a cropped bustier — enveloped in a huge, three-dimensional red Chinese dragon; Kendall Jenner — in blood red — wore thigh-high boots, a long-line plunging bra and suede angel wing and Gigi Hadid looked like she would take off in flight, sporting a hand-painted cape with an Aztec-pattern that billowed as she walked. \nThe high-octane show was divided into six thematic sections, reflected in the colorful styles that bore inches of bare skin: Road Ahead, Mountain Romance, Pink Nation, Secret Angel, Dark Angel and Bright Night Angel. \nThe signature wings fluttered throughout — in feather, silk, gold gild, suede and Swarovski crystal. \n“Not only do the wings get bigger but we tap into new artisans and people who do things with 3-D printing … that’s always the wonderful thing about working on the show,” said Victoria’s Secret Executive Producer Monica Mitro. \nAs the show ended, a million pieces of glittered ribbon fell on the angels and the adoring crowds. Model Alessandra Ambrosio displays a creation during the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show inside the Grand Palais, in Paris, Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. The pulse-quickening, celebrity-filled catwalk event of the year : the Victoria’s Secret fashion show takes place in Paris with performances from Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. AP Gaga, Mars, The Weeknd \nWith a retro bleached hairstyle, Lady Gaga gave a rousing and gutsy live performance of “Million Reasons” to the crowd, and appeared again for “A-YO.” \nAt one point her microphone got stuck in the tassels of her dark cowboy hat, but this didn’t stop the consummate professional, who continued singing “John Wayne” as Victoria’s Secret models danced with her and crisscrossed the runway rhythmically to the beat. \nAs the 30-year-old popstar ended her set, she walked over to kiss Hadid’s mother, reality TV star Yolanda Hadid, in her front row seat. (Before the show, Gaga treated her Instagram followers to a photo of herself in silver Victoria’s Secret underwear). \nBruno Mars also performed several times, ramping up the energy and using the catwalk as his stage — in signature shades, with tuxedo-wearing backing dancers jiving behind him. \nThe American singer had guests jumping up and down for funky performances of “24K Magic” and “Chunky.” \nBut it was perhaps The Weeknd that got the most cheers of the night. The singer serenaded Bella Hadid — with whom he has been romantically linked — with his hit song “Starboy,” and almost followed her up the catwalk as she walked in a lace gown with silk organza corset. $3 Million Fantasy Bra \nThe Victoria’s Secret Fantasy bra the 25-year-old Jasmine Tookes was selected to wear is considered the piece de resistance of the brand’s runway display. \nThe bra, glimmering with thousands of gemstones, was presented like crown jewels ahead of the show. An incredible work of art, it was designed by Eddie Borgo and hand-crafted over 700 hours with gems from jeweler AWMouzannar. \n“It is so beautiful. It’s covered in white diamonds and emeralds and it has about 9,000 gemstones. It cost $3 million — so stunning,” gushed Tookes backstage while she was having her hair done. \nIt’s the third time a black model has been chosen to model the Fantasy Bra. \nTookes said the garment was constructed on a mold of her upper body, literally made to measure. \nWhile the bra may be perfect for the runway presentation, Tookes joked she probably wouldn’t want to go for a jog in it, given its weight. \n“It’s very heavy; it weighs more than 450 karats. It weighs down on my shoulders a little bit, but it’s so worth it,” she said, cheekily adding: “I might jog out of this show with it though.” A (Hadid) family affair \nHadid, 52, was the proudest of mothers Wednesday night. \nFor the first time, the former model could boast that Bella was included in the Victoria’s Secret model line-up as well as Gigi for 2016. \n“Last year, Gigi got it and Bella didn’t get it and I felt awkward being there having Bella at home. And this year, it’s just so perfect because they’re both here. We’re celebrating, the sisters together,” she told The AP. \nThe three posed for cameras and kissed on the pink carpet following the collection — in a show of family love. \n“It’s all surreal. I mean, I came here when I was 16, modeling. So many years have gone by and to be here with both my girls.it’s emotional. I keep looking at them and pinching myself. Whoever thought that this would happen?” she added. The original angel \nShe was one of the original Victoria’s Secret models back in 1995. \nNow at 51 years old — and just as youthful-looking — Veronica Webb spoke to the AP about the challenges and particularities of the famed fashion show that she began 21 years ago. \n“I was in the first Victoria’s Secret show and it was one of the most challenging bookings that I ever did because, obviously, if you’re in a room and everyone else is dressed and you’re in your underwear it’s a little bit embarrassing,” she said, laughing. \nWebb, who made history as the first African-American to ever have a cosmetics contract, also recalled how important the experience boosted her professional life. \n“It was one of the proudest moments of my career also because it took so much discipline and making so many fitness goals to get there,” she said. \nEven Victoria’s Secret models get nervous \nBrazilian beauty Lais Ribeiro physically jumped when a loudspeaker bellowed there was just one hour until show time. \n“Butterflies just came stronger in my stomach. I’m getting very, very excited,” Ribeiro, 26, told The Associated Press. \nRibeiro knows more than most about the hidden dangers in a show such as this, where models in towering heels can injure themselves. She hurt her foot as a Victoria’s Secret Angel three years ago. \n“What am I scared of? I twisted my ankle and kind of broke my foot in the rehearsal three years ago. So I’m always scared of the high heels (that might make) me miss this amazing show,” she said. Security tight \nHours before Wednesday’s show began, hundreds of meters in the area around Paris’ Grand Palais and the Champs Elysées avenue were in near lock-down, barricaded with passing tourists and fashionistas alike getting frisked. \nBomb squad dogs sniffed out every single bag that entered the Grand Palais where the fashion show took place. \nParis remains in a state of emergency following last November’s Paris attacks at a concert hall and various spots around the capital. City of Angels \nThe Angels, as Victoria’s Secret top models are known, have taken Paris — and their Instagram accounts — by storm since flying into the City of Light on Sunday night. \nLed by Alessandra Ambrosio, the troupe posed for photos outside the Eiffel Tower on Tuesday morning as gob-smacked tourists stopped to take in the incredible views, which included the monument. \nJosephine Skriver, Adriana Lima, Lily Donaldson, Hosk, Lily Aldridge and Tookes wore assorted Angels T-shirts and skinny, figure-hugging black jeans. \nBut the fun continued online, with Lima posting a from-behind shot of her and Martha Hunt wearing thigh-high boots during the show’s preparations. \nMere mortals may use a face mask ahead of a glamorous night out — but these are Angels, and terrestrial rules don’t apply. \nTrending online were photos of some of the models using 24-karat gold sheet masks to prepare for the 2016 show.",

If we look at the result, it is the best of the season. The opponents were far superior.\"\nLionel Messi 's second-half reply to a Willian Jose strike earned the point for Barcelona, but Luis Enrique was far from impressed and said it was a miracle his side were still in the game at the interval.\nPer Sport English , he said:\nThey've not allowed us to string five passes together, they pressed us as and when they wanted, they won all the battles and you have to say that to be goalless at halftime was a miracle.\nIn the second half we improved a little, but not enough. We got back into the game through an isolated moment between [Lionel] Messi and Neymar, but there was little else.\nCertainly Luis Enrique will have to galvanise his side to find a positive response against Real Madrid in the first Clasico of the campaign.",

While CEO Jeff Bezos was quick to deny the claims , it seems not all is calm behind the curtain. \nA distressed Amazon employee has jumped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters in what police have described as a suicide attempt, Bloomberg reports . The incident occurred on Monday around 8:45AM local time. The man has survived the fall and has since been taken to a hospital in Seattle, police said. \nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, the employee, whose name wasn’t revealed by authorities, sent a distraught email note to CEO Jeff Bezos and co-workers prior to leaping off. Bloomberg writes: \nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. \nThe anonymous source further said that, in the email, the employee voiced his frustrations with how Amazon handled his transfer request and hinted that he might harm himself. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nAmazon isn’t the only company that has faced accusations over its exploitative working conditions. Back in 2009, Chinese Foxconn factory employee Sun Danyong committed suicide after his house was raided following the disappearance of an iPhone prototype. \nWhat’s worrying is this isn’t an isolated case. More recently, another Foxconn factory employee jumped to his death from one of the company’s buildings after only one month at the job. \nTo come back to Amazon: While last year Bezos brushed off the incidents brought to light by the New York Times as “isolated anecdotes”, I’m not so sure this sort of excuse will fly this time around – and nor should it.",

Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump threatened on Monday to end President Obama’s push to forge diplomatic relations and relax sanctions against Cuba, suggesting that he might wipe away two years of executive action to strengthen ties if he cannot reach “a better deal” for both Cuba and the United States. In a post on Twitter that came three days after the death of Fidel Castro , the father of Cuba’s revolution and embodiment of a half-century of suspicion and hostility between the United States and Cuba, Mr. Trump gave no details about what kind of changes he would seek in Mr. Obama’s policy. But the comment hinted that the president-elect, who has been critical of the shift toward greater engagement between Americans and Cubans, is considering reinstating restrictions on commerce, trade and financial transactions that Mr. Obama has stripped away since he announced two years ago that he and President Raúl Castro had agreed to normalize relations. He has already installed Maurico Claver-Carone, a Cuban-American who has been a harsh critic of Mr. Obama’s opening, on his transition team for the Treasury Department, which has issued several rounds of regulations to remove impediments for United States companies and individuals seeking to do business with Cuba and travel there. If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Nov. 28, 2016 Mr. Trump’s advisers were vague about what his approach would be on Cuba, telling reporters in a conference call that Mr. Trump would address the issue when he assumed office. “To be clear, the president-elect wants to see freedom in Cuba for Cubans,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman.",

    "text": "Editorial: Trump’s not-so-blind trust fails ethical standards \nThe 1,200-mile pipeline would carry oil across four states to a shipping point in Illinois. The project has been held up while the Army Corps of Engineers consults with the Standing Rock Sioux, who believe the project could harm the tribe’s drinking water and Native American cultural sites. \nThe delay, which comes as protests unfold daily along the proposed route, raises the likelihood that a final decision will be made by Trump, a pipeline supporter who has vowed to ‘‘unleash’’ unfettered production of oil and gas. He takes office in January. Advertisement \n‘‘Trump’s investments in the pipeline business threaten to undercut faith in this process — which was already frayed — by interjecting his own financial well-being into a much bigger decision,’’ said Sharon Buccino, director of the land and wildlife program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. \n‘‘This should be about the interests of the many, rather than giving the appearance of looking at the interests of a few — including Trump,’’ Buccino said. \nTrump, a billionaire who has never held public office, holds ownership stakes in more than 500 companies worldwide. He has said he plans to transfer control of his company to three of his adult children, but ethics experts have said conflicts could engulf the new administration if Trump does not liquidate his business holdings. \nRep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., senior Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, called Trump’s investment in the pipeline company ‘‘disturbing’’ and said it fits a pattern evident in Trump’s transition team. \n‘‘You have climate (change) deniers, industry lobbyists and energy conglomerates involved in that process,’’ Grijalva said. ‘‘The pipeline companies are gleeful. This is pay-to-play at its rawest.’’ \nBesides Trump, at least two possible candidates for energy secretary also could benefit from the pipeline. Oil billionaire Harold Hamm could ship oil from his company, Continental Resources, through the pipeline, while former Texas Gov. Rick Perry serves on the board of directors of Energy Transfer Partners. \nConcern about Trump’s possible conflicts comes as protests over the pipeline have intensified in recent weeks, with total arrests since August rising to 528. A clash this past week near the main protest camp in North Dakota left a police officer and several protesters injured. \nNorth Dakota Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple, along with GOP Sen. John Hoeven and Rep. Kevin Cramer, called on President Barack Obama to authorize the Army Corps of Engineers to approve the pipeline crossing, the last large segment of the nearly completed pipeline. \nKelcy Warren, CEO of Dallas-based Energy Transfer, told The Associated Press that he expects Trump to make it easier for his company and others to complete infrastructure projects. \n‘‘Do I think it’s going to get easier? Of course,’’ said Warren, who donated $3,000 to Trump’s campaign, plus $100,000 to a committee supporting Trump’s candidacy and $66,800 to the Republican National Committee. \n‘‘If you’re in the infrastructure business,’’ he said, ‘‘you need consistency. That’s where this process has gotten off track.’’ \nThe Army Corps of Engineers granted Warren’s company the permits needed for the crossing in July, but the agency decided in September that further analysis was warranted, given the tribe’s concerns. On Nov. 14, the corps called for even more study. \nThe company has asked a federal judge to declare it has the right to lay pipe under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota. The judge isn’t likely to issue a decision until January at the earliest. Related ",

    "text": "8 Foods You Must Eat When You’re in Portugal By Erika Owen \nT+L Just In newsletter. T+L Newsletters \nIf you're in to food, and trying all different kinds of things, Portugal needs to be next on your trip list. \nWhile they hold tight to their traditional recipes—you can try cod a thousand different ways around the entire country—the locals sure know how to surprise taste buds with ingredients that have been used for ages. \nOn a recent trip to Portugal, we met up with André of Taste Porto Food Tours , which turned out to be one of the best decisions of the trip. Not only did he know of all of the best restaurants that someone spending two days in the area would never know about, but he had stories and history lessons to share on every step of the tour. And, of course, he knew where the very best food could be found. \nThe tour itself took up an entire night—and it was 100 percent worth it. Here are many of the things we tried on the tour, plus a few other must-try dishes discovered during the rest of my trip. \nJust consider this another reason to visit the 2016 Destination of the Year . Pastèis de Nata \nThis bite-sized custard tart (pictured above) is known around the world as one of the best foods to come out of Portugal. While there are bakeries in many more countries than just Portugal offering this sweet treat, the tarts originated in the 19th century from a group of monks living in Belém. \nThey sold the pastries from a small general store attached to the property's sugar cane refinery as a way to survive the convents and monasteries being shut down during the liberal revolution in 1834. \nYou can now find these pastries in any Portuguese bakery. Pastèis de Chaves Oporto Food Tours \nThese flaky pastries come with a variety of fillings: veal, chocolate, chicken, tomato, egg, cod. The best place to get them may just be in Porto at a little shop call Loja dos Pastéis de Chaves . \nThe pastries come from a northern city in Portugal called Chaves, and this bakery uses the original recipe. Terylene Sandwich Oporto Food Tours \nThis sandwich takes 24 hours to prepare. It has roasted pork loin and smoked ham—the former of which is cured for 20 hours with a mix of wine, tomatoes, rosemary, garlic, and chili peppers. After the meats are roasted for hours, they come together in a double bun, where the remaining juices melt right into the bread. \nPair this sandwich—which you can get at a restaurant on a semi-hidden alley street called Flor dos Congregados —with sparking red wine for a culinary match made in heaven. Coffee at Café Guarany Oporto Food Tours \nIf you're looking for quirky art, great espresso, and a fancy setting, head to Café Guarany . Here, they call a short espresso a “cimbalino,” in homage to the first espresso machines introduced to Portugal by a brand called La Cimbali. \nYou can find great espresso in every city in Portugal, and it's a common way to end a meal. Chocolate and Lemon Eclairs Oporto Food Tours \nIf you couldn't tell, chocolate and pastries are a favorite for the Portuguese. Hop and any review website and you'll find travelers pining for the eclairs from Leitaria da Quinta do Paço in Porto. \nWe made a stop to give the chocolate and lemon eclairs a try. Pro tip: Order extra cream to eat with the pastries—and there's no shame in eating it with a spoon. Cheese & Charcuterie Plates Erika Owen \nCheese and cured meats are always a good choice in Portugal. Each region has its own take on the plate, and you'll always get some bread and olives to go with your picks. Taberna do Largo —a restaurant in the TK neighborhood of Porto—is run by a brother and sister who travel the world to find the best meat, cheese, olives, and wine from smaller producers. \nDon't miss out on trying Portugal's storied vinho verde (“green wine”) while you're here. Sushi \nShana Novak \nPortugal's access to the Atlantic Ocean makes it a great spot for fresh sushi. But head to Sushi Design at Farol Design Hotel in Cascais and you'll find much more than your basic spicy tuna or salmon avocado rolls. \nSushi Master Nuande Pekel mixes ingredients and presentation in a way that will redefine your expectations of the Japanese staple for years to come. Our favorite: a Hosomaki roll with breaded salmon, cream cheese, strawberry and katsuobushi with tare sauce. Cecina de Vaca Maturada Erika Owen \nPortugal really knows how to do smoked and cured meats. Of the entire trip, a plate of cecina de vaca maturada (aged cow steak) was the most memorable—not only for its vivid color and presentation, but becuase each bite was melt-in-your-mouth good. \nIf you want to try it yourself, head to RIB BEEF & Wine Restaurant at the Pestana Vintage in Porto.

The combination of Prescott and Elliott, however, can paper over a lot of the team's cracks on defense. \nThursday's victory was the 10th in a row for Dallas, and the team continues to keep the Seattle Seahawks at bay for the top seed in the NFC. So long as Prescott and Elliott stay healthy, the Cowboys remain poised for a deep playoff run.",

    "text": "Thatcher 'resisted' chancellor's new kitchen plea 25 November 2016 Close share panel Image copyright PA Margaret Thatcher was reluctant to allow her first Chancellor Sir Geoffrey Howe to spend £4,150 on a new kitchen, newly-released papers show. \nThe papers from 1979 show Edna Healey, wife of Sir Geoffrey's predecessor, warned of the \"antediluvian\" room at Number 11 Downing Street. \nThree calls were made to \"nag\" Mrs Thatcher to approve the refurbishment. \nReplies from a private secretary suggest the PM may have been reluctant to become involved amid spending cuts. \nThe exchanges are revealed in the late chancellor's secret papers in the National Archives from 1979-1983. \nThey show his predecessor Denis Healey was the first person to contact Sir Geoffrey after he was appointed after the Conservative landslide general election win. \nBut the new chancellor was said to be even more surprised to hear Mr Healey was passing on a message from his wife, Edna, to Sir Geoffrey's wife, Elspeth, warning her not to move into the flat at Number 11 unless the kitchen was updated. 'Chancellor's discretion' \nAn estimate for the work was submitted but it took three calls by Treasury officials over a three month period to elicit a reply from Mrs Thatcher's staff. \nIn his reply, one of Mrs Thatcher's private secretaries, Colin Paterson, wrote: \"I am very sorry that this has been so long outstanding. I was under the impression that the prime minister had had a word with the chancellor. \n\"If not, I am sure that she would wish to leave this to the chancellor's discretion, keeping in mind how sensitive expenditure of this kind can be.\" \nAnother document in the National Archives outlines radical plans to end universal free healthcare. \nThe document stamped \"secret\" was called, in keeping with films and books of that era, \"The Omega Project\". \nCivil servants noted that \"for the majority it would represent the abolition of the NHS\". \nBut in spite of what was described as the nearest thing to a Cabinet riot in the history of the Thatcher administration, the prime minister secretly pressed ahead with the plans - before later backing down.

GETTY Today is the UN's international day for the elimination of violence to women and girls \nThe Ministry for Families, Seniors, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ) will now provide money for the scheme which aims to give better protection to the vulnerable, including the remodelling of migrant centres to give more privacy to females and minors. \nPolice have for long told of a rising trend of abuse, including rapes, but in the highly-charged political atmosphere that surrounds the whole refugee issue in Germany the problem has largely remained unaddressed. \nMunicipal authorities will be able to get the money from central government in the form of in zero-interest loans. GETTY Angela Merkel's government pledged over £160 million to tackle sexual abuse against German refugees \n\"Unfortunately we know that children and women in the camps are not safe from abuse and sexual assault. That's why we have to make sure that they're protected,\" said junior minister Ralf Kleindiek. \n\"Not only measures regarding staff, but also structural measures have to be implemented such as lockable accommodation units and separate sanitary facilities. \n\"For the children and adolescents we also need designated rooms to enable play and learning.\" \nFuelling the rise in sexual assaults is alcohol. \nMany Muslim men are exposed to alcoholic drinks for the first time in their lives, leading to booze binges that end in mayhem. GOOGLE MAPS In and around Stuttgart alone there were 105 rapes, assaults and robberies on women \nA clampdown on this has started with a ban on all alcohol being brought into any migrant shelter anywhere in the country. \nPart of the scheme to clamp down on sex abuse involves working with experts from Unicef to train staff in how to deal with the problem at more than 100 centres. \nAround £3 million of the total amount available will be spent on constructing specialist centres to provide counselling for survivors of rape and torture. \nThe government has also formed a working group in a bid to solve the problem of child marriages. \nHundreds, if not thousands, of those who streamed into Germany in the past 18 months have child brides. \nThese unions were legal in their homelands but not in Germany where - with some court mandated exceptions - the legal marrying age is 18.

    "text": "Bluefields (Nicaragua) (AFP) - Central America suffered a hurricane and offshore earthquake at the same time, triggering alarm in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica but no immediate reports of any casualties. Nicaragua was caught in the middle of both events, with Hurricane Otto, a storm packing sustained winds of up to 175 kilometers (110 miles) per hour at the time, plowing into its Caribbean coast while the 7.0 quake occurred in the Pacific Ocean, off its other coast.\nNicaraguan President Daniel Ortega declared a national emergency to handle both potential disasters.\nBut hours later, there were no reports of any widespread destruction, only of fallen trees and electrical cables, and a few collapsed roofs from the storm.\nEl Salvador ordered residents along its Pacific shore to move inland. But it and Nicaragua soon lifted tsunami alerts they had issued as a precaution.\nBy nightfall, Otto was \"weakening rapidly over southern Nicaragua,\" the US-based National Hurricane Center said in a 0000 GMT bulletin.\nThe Miami-based NHC said Otto's maximum sustained winds had slowed to 75 miles (120 kilometers) per hour in Nicaragua.\nIn Panama, eight people lost their lives during the storm in recent days, three of them directly linked, Jose Donderis, director of the national civil protection service, said Thursday at a news conference.\nThe other five people died through acts of negligence or risky behavior, such as not following authorities' warnings, he said.\nOtto's projected path was through sparsely inhabited rural areas in southern Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica. It was expected to weaken to a tropical storm late Thursday before exiting into the Pacific.\nSatellite images showed Bluefields, Nicaragua's main Caribbean city, bearing the brunt of the hurricane, but there was almost no wind or rain.\nAn AFP journalist there said there was even some sunshine.\n\"We haven't lost any lives. Things are going well. We think that tonight (Thursday), people should be able to start going back to their homes,\" said a government representative in Bluefields, Lumberto Campbell.\n- High vigilance -\nIn San Juan de Nicaragua further south, the town closest to where Otto made landfall, there were reports of strong wind and rain, with fallen trees and electrical cables, and roofs torn off -- but no deaths or injuries.\nNeighboring Costa Rica, which had been fearing its first direct hit from a hurricane since records began in 1851, also showed little damage.\nThe government had declared a national emergency, closed schools, sent non-essential workers home for Thursday and Friday, and evacuated around 4,000 people from its Caribbean coast.\nVigilance remained high in Nicaragua and Costa Rica, however, given the risk of mudslides in coming days from the storm's rains.\nIn El Salvador, following the quake, officials scrambled to evaluate the possible damage. The task was made more difficult because some telephone lines in the capital San Salvador had been cut.",

Our Franchisee Employee Helpline (1800 711 243) is a dedicated, external and independent service, available to all employees of 7-Eleven Franchisees, to raise issues and concerns in regard to misconduct, unethical and illegal activity within franchised 7-Eleven stores. \nOver the past year 7-Eleven has made a significant investment in industry-leading initiatives across our franchisee network, including a bio-metric time clock system and centralised payroll system, and a significant increase in field-level investigation and compliance activity, to ensure to ensure that all store team members receive the wages and conditions applicable under the relevant award. \nIn respect to the allegations raised today by the ABC, we were not previously aware of any concerns relating to this store, and no staff member has raised any issue with us. As soon as the allegations were raised with us by the ABC, we commenced an internal investigation. \nWe will be appalled if these allegations are proven. Our Franchisee network knows we take a zero tolerance approach to wage fraud. Our new measures are designed to ensure that team members are paid their appropriate wages in full. The alleged practice occurs after the correct wages have been paid, and is effectively extortion or theft in breach of the law, our Franchise Agreement, our policies and our values. \nWithout having seen the complete evidence behind the staff member’s allegation aired by the ABC, it is inappropriate for us to jump to a conclusion. However, we will aggressively investigate and, where required, act upon any allegations of illegal Franchisee activity, up to and including termination of the Franchise Agreement. We also encourage any staff disadvantaged by such activity to contact us directly and we will promptly pursue repayment of any monies owed to them by their employer.",

DACA protects 741,546 individuals nationwide, including 7,025 with addresses in Massachusetts, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services\nMost colleges do not require students to be citizens to attend and many do not ask domestic students about their immigration status on applications. Ivy League colleges, in particular, have encouraged undocumented students to apply and offered them scholarships since they are ineligible for federal loans.\nAdvertisement\nAfter Trump’s victory earlier this month and in response to student outcry, schools have convened teams of lawyers, professors, and administrators to weigh possibilities and legal strategies to shield students.\n“People are taking [Trump] at his word and so preparing for the worst,” said Roberto Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education who specializes in the education of immigrants and Latino students.\nEven as Brown University’s president signed the petition in support of DACA, she was realistic with students last week in an op-ed she wrote in the student newspaper after more than 600 students turned out for a rally.\n“While we wish we could offer absolute protection to members of our community who are threatened by possible changes in policy, it would be irresponsible to promise protections that we cannot legally deliver,” Brown’s president, Christina Paxson, wrote.\nStill, it remains improbable that the authorities would target college students, said a Department of Homeland Security official.\nIn 2010, undocumented Harvard student Eric Balderas was detained at a Texas airport, but officials with ICE ultimately decided not to deport him .\n“ICE is focused on the arrest of convicted criminals who pose a threat to public safety as well as recent border crosses,” said the official, who spoke on background. “Historically and currently, neither schools nor their students have been a focus of ICE operations.’’\n‘We have a moral responsibility to protect the safety and well-being of all students regardless of their citizenship status.’\nAnthony Monaco, Tufts University president ICE has not and does not conduct enforcement on campuses unless there is a serious and extraordinary circumstance involved, such as a threat to national security, the official added.\nMIT, Harvard, Boston University, Northeastern, Tufts, Yale, Dartmouth, Brown, and Middlebury College, in response to inquiries from the Globe, all said they are monitoring the incoming administration’s actions and want to protect their students.\nWesleyan University’s president, Michael S. Roth, took a strong position Sunday in a message on the college’s website, declaring that Wesleyan “will not voluntarily assist in any efforts by the federal government to deport our students, faculty, or staff solely because of their citizenship status.”\nEven before Trump was elected, some colleges were providing special resources for undocumented students.\nThe University of Connecticut in September added a tab on its admissions site specifically for undocumented students. In Connecticut, such students are eligible for in-state tuition.\nIn May, University of California’s president, Janet Napolitano, announced a three-year plan, her second such effort, to support undocumented students with additional services and more money for student loans. The system’s chancellor last week said it will not cooperate with law enforcement to deport students.\nTufts University in Medford convened a task force more than a year ago to weigh how to best meet the needs of undocumented students.\n“We have a moral responsibility to protect the safety and well-being of all students regardless of their citizenship status or personal identities,” Tufts president Anthony Monaco told students at a rally last week.\nHarvard students delivered a petition to the university’s president, Drew Faust, last week asking for more campus resources for undocumented students, including a dedicated staff member.\nHarvard has about 40 undocumented undergraduates and Brown has about 20, according to the schools. Harvard spokeswoman Rachael Dane said the college is “committed to supporting undocumented students.”\nElimination of DACA could have other wide-ranging consequences, said Susan Church, an immigration attorney in Boston, including making such students ineligible for certain types of financial aid and jobs. It would also cause a flurry of litigation on behalf of students, she said.\n“Politically it would be a disaster for [Trump] to start with this group of immigrants,” Church said.\nWhatever happens, this election is seared into the memory of many of those students, a stark reminder of their fragile status even on elite college campuses.\nHarvard freshman Rosa Vazquez said she couldn’t sleep on election night.\n“It was like the people that I had faith in, and this American dream that I loved with my whole heart and had pursued for so many years, telling me that I wasn’t worth it,” said Vazquez, who came to the United States from Mexico when she was 8 months old.\nAfter the election, Vazquez has focused her energy on advocating for Harvard’s undocumented students.\nBrown student Renata Mauriz, who came from Brazil when she was 12, helped organize the rally at the Providence school. Mauriz is unsure what it will mean to graduate undocumented into a world with Trump as president.\nThese days, though, her future seems less important than that of her mother, an undocumented worker in New Jersey who she says endures long hours and low pay because she wants her two children to have a chance.\n“For me, having that diploma, it’s my duty for her,” Mauriz said.\nLaura Krantz can be reached at laura.krantz@globe.com .

    "text": "4 COMMENTS What happens to the Democratic Party in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory?\nTo get insights, The Wall Street Journal’s Gerald F. Seib spoke with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Here are edited excerpts of their discussion.\nMR. SEIB: A couple of days after the election, you said, “If we learn nothing else from the past two years of electioneering, we should hear the message loud and clear that the American people want Washington to change. It was clear in the Democratic primaries. It was clear in the Republican primaries. It was clear in the campaign and it was clear on Election Day.” How do Democrats show that they heard that message?\nSEN. WARREN: The interesting question is going to be both halves. How are the Democrats going to show it, and how is Donald Trump going to show that he actually heard that message? That’s the message he ran on. What Donald Trump is doing is putting together a transition team that is full of lobbyists—the kind of people that he ran against. [Vice President-elect Mike Pence has since ordered the removal of all lobbyists from the transition team.]\nJournal Report Read more at WSJ.com/LeadershipReport More in CEO Council Rudolph Giuliani on Trump’s Immediate Agenda Kellyanne Conway: The Election Was All About Security Fed Governor Tarullo Talks Interest Rates What Global Disease Threat Worries Public-Health Officials Most? Preet Bharara on Keeping Corporate Executives Honest The clearest point that comes out of this election is that the American people do not want Wall Street to run their government. They do not want corporate executives to be the ones who are calling the shots in Washington.\nLook at the polling from this, that about three-quarters of all Americans do believe that the game is rigged. They believe it is rigged in favor of the people in this room and that it is rigged against them and their families and their children. And they want to see change.\nThey want to see that connection between Wall Street and giant corporations and our government broken. They want that not to happen anymore. They want a government that runs for the people. That’s what I think this election is about.\nMR. SEIB: So how do the two parties show that? What do Democrats do? What does the Trump team do that it’s not doing now in your opinion?\nSEN. WARREN: Well, it doesn’t start by hiring a bunch of lobbyists to run the transition. It doesn’t start by floating names of people who’ve run giant hedge funds, or been part of that, to be able to run the Treasury. Or people who come from industry to be able to run the regulatory agencies.\nThe American people understand about the revolving door. They’re really sick of it.\nHe did not win on Mitch McConnell,Paul Ryan, business as usual, what can we do to help the giant corporations in America.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren discusses what the 2016 election indicates about what Americans want from government. Photo: Paul Morse The K Street lobbyists are absolutely out there, salivating. They say, “This is our big chance. We’re going to get to slash regulations. Look for a tax cut for those at the top.” That is not what the people who elected Donald Trump are thinking.\nMR. SEIB: Is there a place where populists in the Democratic Party and a Trump administration could come together?\nSEN. WARREN: This just keeps going back to, what is Donald Trump going to do? He’s now given us the first tangible sign of his vision of how to run a Trump presidency. And a big part of that are lobbyists and Washington insiders.\nAnd let’s face it. There was a lot during the election of the toxic stew of bigotry and attacks on Americans all across this country. Donald Trump started his campaign with an attack on Mexican-Americans and then he rode the escalator down. He did attacks on women, on African-Americans, on Muslims, on immigrants. He did attacks on people with disabilities. Everybody who didn’t look like the people who showed up at his rallies.\nThere were a lot of people who were attracted to that. But there were a lot of people who were not and yet voted for Donald Trump. They said, “We want somebody who’s going to shake it up.”\nHere I am with the business leaders of America, and I just want to underline something that every one of you know. Bigotry is bad for business.\nBigotry is not what your employees expect. Bigotry is not what your customers expect. And if that’s the direction that this administration goes, that creates a real problem for everybody.\nThe change in sides MR. SEIB: But as you suggest, there are millions of people who voted for Donald Trump not for those reasons. Most of those people used to be Democrats. How did your party lose them? Why were they Trump voters?\nSEN. WARREN: I think that Donald Trump made the promise to shake things up. He made the argument over and over and over that the Democrats were too close to Wall Street and too close to big business. That was the core of his economic argument, that too many insiders were calling the shots. That too many multinational corporations were running the trade deals. That too many people who’d already made it big were using the tools of government to work for themselves and not to work for anyone else.\nSen. Elizabeth Warren discusses the signals Donald Trump is sending about his presidency. Photo: Paul Morse I want to be clear. I think Hillary Clinton ran on very much the same argument, I just think Donald Trump made it aggressively. But the point is, you can’t miss this about the election. Whether they drove it effectively or whether they drove it less effectively, it was driving the message that Washington needs to work for the little guy. That Washington needs to work for the families who’ve been left behind. That Washington doesn’t need to work for those at the top anymore. And this is so important going forward because it raises this question about what does the economic agenda look like.\nSetting the agenda MR. SEIB: Well, let’s talk about that. What should the economic agenda look like, in your opinion?\nSEN. WARREN: I think there’s no mandate out there for Mitch McConnell and for Paul Ryan. I think there is no mandate right now to cut regulations and say, “I know, let’s just turn a bunch of Wall Street banks loose and see what they will do. Let’s not remember what happened in 2008 and the run-up to 2008.” I think the appetite for that among the American people is zero.\nWhether people were voting for Hillary Clinton or whether they were voting for Donald Trump, they weren’t voting for Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan’s deregulatory mix—let guys do whatever they want to do, let giant corporations do whatever they want to do.\nWrite to reports@wsj.com",

    "text": "FOREIGN WORKER BOOKS RIDE - HIS STORY WILL MAKE U APPRECIATE UR LIFE & UR FAMILY   Mon, 21/11/2016 - 9:26pm \n<Facebook post by Cassandra Tan> \nMy first passenger today brought me to tears and I had to hold it back till I dropped him off. \nAt 5.46am, I got a booking from Bt Timah Road. It didn't state what number, just the road name. I called him, he said he didn't know what number or where he was. He just said he was sitting at a bus stop at Bt Timah Road. Bt Timah Road is so long. I asked him to describe what he saw nearby. He said cars, trees, at a bus stop. I asked him to look for the bus stop number, I got silence and muffling sounds. \nSensing something very wrong, \nI said...just sit there and wait for me. I will find you! \nFrom where I was, I thought...if the booking came to me. He must be at the few bus stops nearest to me, but Bt Timah Road was left and right. So I tried the right side first. \nThere he was... a lone Indian foreign worker sitting at the bus stop, looking around aimlessly. \nI stopped my car, asked him if he had booked a car. He nodded. He opened the front door and asked if he could sit in front politely as he will vomit if he sit behind(his words). \nHe got in, I offered him a plastic bag and a sweet which he politely declined. \nI confirmed his dropoff address, he nodded. He was upset. So I drove on, leaving him to calm down. \nHalfway through, I asked him if he was okay. He nodded. \nSo I asked why he was at that bus stop (very quiet corner) so early that morning. He said he walked there. \nI said from where. \nApparently home was where I was sending him now....very far from where he was. \nSo I casually mentioned.... wow that's a very long walk. \nSo the talk continues... \nMe: So where are you from? Advertisement \nI then offered him some tissues and he took to wipe his tears... \nMe: It's ok. You can talk. \nSilence then then he spoke. \n(After this, I was quiet for a long time while he spoke) \nHis next words: my wife die after born my baby girl. In that little bit of English that he could speak.... He went on to say he and his wife were orphans at an orphanage and grew up together and fell in love. They had to \"betroth\"(his word \"sell\") their baby girl to a family in their village so they had money to pay for doctor visits for her pregnancy. The baby was supposed to be turned over to the family at age 12. His wife died during childbirth and the family had claimed the baby girl after the hospital turned her over to them. This man sitting next to me now will never have the chance to see his baby girl or even put his wife to rest. \nAfter I dropped him off, I declined to take his fare and even wanted to give him money for an airfare home. \nHe simply refused to take it and said no use go home. \nHe just said \"Thank you for hear me\" and left. \nHe probably needed to be alone now. \n4 hours later when I finished my driving.... as I was clearing my things, I found 2 $10 notes in a slot on the passenger door. He had stuck them there after I refused to take his fare. \nI tried calling him on the same number.... it has been off the last many hours. \nMy dear friends, give your kids and partner a good cuddle and many kisses today please! \n*Update* 21/11/116 \nI managed to call through the phone this morning. It was picked up by another Indian man who said the phone is actually his and the man (his friend) had left this morning for home. I asked how? He said \"Boss give money send\". He told me also....no call here again. I hope he will be blessed and find peace within himself soon. \nI didn't expect this post to go viral but thank you to everyone who shared to let people know what some of our foreign workers face.

    "text": "Advice on manners and morals. Nov. 22 2016 9:08 AM I Before We Prudie advises a letter writer whose sister’s refusal to spell correctly is having deleterious family effects. Mallory Ortberg Sam Breach \nMallory Ortberg, aka Dear Prudence, is online weekly to chat live with readers. An edited transcript of the chat is below. (Sign up below to get Dear Prudence delivered to your inbox each week. Read Prudie’s Slate columns here . Send questions to Prudence at .) \nReaders! Ask me your questions on the voicemail of the Dear Prudence podcast. Just leave a message at 401-371-DEAR (3327), and you may hear your question answered on a future episode of the show. stu99/Thinkstock Advertisement \nQ. Arrogant aunt: My sister taught my son an incorrect spelling of a word. She said that it was always spelled that way until recently, and that it was only changed because people were too dumb to spell it right. I found evidence to the contrary, but that didn’t seem to faze her. (The word is dilemma , which she insists is actually spelled dilemNa .) I don’t want my son spelling words wrong, but more importantly I don’t want him to pick up his aunt’s attitude that “I’m right, and everyone who says otherwise is wrong,” which unfortunately he seems to be doing. Do I need to keep him away from her? \nA: Your sister is stone-cold wrong; the word dilemma has never been spelled with an “n.” It’s a Berenstain Bears -style Mandela Effect . However, I think you should probably limit the number of family estrangements you initiate over linguistic prescriptivism, even as unpleasant as prescriptivism tends to be. Consider this an opportunity to teach your son about analyzing other people’s worldviews and making decisions for himself—is there truly something morally superior in spelling a word with an “n” versus an “m”? Or is his aunt simply attempting to assert some sense of order and authority due to her own inability to deal with ambiguity? Subscribe to Prudie! \nJust because your sister seems to have a hard time letting things go, coupled with a need to be right 100 percent of the time, doesn’t mean you should try to match her. Tell your son that sometimes reasonable people disagree, and even if you think she’s incorrect, it doesn’t mean you have to cut off contact or “prove” to her that she’s wrong. Show your son a gentler, less-controlling way of seeing the world, and I think he’ll find it more attractive than your sister’s—no need to “keep him away” from her way of seeing things if you can provide a superior alternative. \nQ. How to retreat from the company retreat?: I work for a small company (12 people in our office) that is pretty tight-knit. Of my co-workers, there are three women in their early-to-mid 20s (myself included in this group) and the rest of the office is comprised of men aged 40 to 60. An interesting office dynamic, but we all mostly get along well. However, I feel boundaries are being pushed after I recently found out about an upcoming company retreat where all of us are expected to spend the night at my boss’s vacation house about two hours away from the city we work in. We’ve been told that a big focus of the trip will be “team bonding” with mention of drinking games. I was also told to bring my swimsuit because there will be a hot tub. Am I off-base, or is this inappropriate for a company event? If we were staying in a resort where we each got our own room, that would be one thing, but staying in one house and presumably sharing rooms makes me uncomfortable, as does the prospect of drinking with co-workers being a focus. The age/gender disparity of the office makes the situation more uncomfortable, and I would feel that my professional relationship with my co-workers, particularly the older men, could be compromised if I have to see them in swimsuits and share bathrooms. Seems like a recipe for a disaster, or at least a lot of awkwardness, and neither I nor my husband are totally comfortable with it. However, as it goes with small companies, it will be painfully obvious if I don’t go and I’ll need to come up with an excuse. I feel that I’m being put in a position to either go and be uncomfortable or not go and reap some degree of professional consequences for not being a “team player.” We are small enough to not have a formal HR department. What should I do here? Advertisement \nA: This may differ from office to office and person to person, but the idea of having to participate in drinking games and a hot tub session with any of the people I’ve ever worked with makes me want to break out into hives, so I don’t think you’re alone in finding this off-putting. If you’re close with your boss, you might consider bringing up your concerns with him—“I’m looking forward to the retreat, but I don’t feel comfortable at the idea of spending time in a hot tub with the people I work with every day, especially since I’ve been told ‘drinking games’ will be part of the schedule, and I don’t want others to feel uncomfortable either. Is there any way we can focus on other team-building activities that don’t require us to share a hot tub? If anyone wants to use it after-hours, of course, I don’t mind, but I’m uncomfortable at the prospect of having that on the list of official activities.” \nIf you don’t think your boss would handle that feedback well, then I think you should plan ahead to minimize your own discomfort (without drawing attention to yourself if you’re afraid you’ll be treated differently for not participating). If you don’t want to drink or get in a hot tub with your co-workers (a perfectly reasonable stance!), come up with a script ahead of time for graceful non-participation: Thanks, I’m not drinking today; I’m coming down with a cold so I won’t join you in the hot tub, etc. It’s unfortunate that you have to come up with any reason other than “I don’t want to take shots and get in a hot tub with my co-workers,” but you do what you have to. \nQ. Election trouble: I’m a liberal black woman who has been in a relationship with a conservative white man for over a year. The day after the election, I cried all day and was unable to dress myself or leave my apartment. Because of Trump’s racist rhetoric, I’m scared for the safety of people of color in particular—and I’m hurt that millions of voters decided that racism wasn’t a dealbreaker. Right before going to visit his mother, my boyfriend told me that his mother, father, and stepmother all voted for Trump. During the visit, I was so hurt and angry I could barely speak to her, especially when she called the protests “stupid.” \nGiven this background, I don’t want to attend Thanksgiving with his father and stepmother this year as is expected. Is it rude of me to bow out? I don’t feel comfortable enough with them to fight them on politics. Advertisement \nA: There are matters of political difference where I think it is important to look for compromise and common ground. This is not one of them. (Peaceful protests, by the way, are an essential component of democratic life; they may not be the only, or even the best, means of disseminating information and inciting change, but that does not mean they are not worthwhile.) It is not rude of you to spend Thanksgiving with your own family and friends, or even just by yourself, this year. It would not be rude of you to reconsider your relationship with this man, if you feel that he is not as concerned for your safety and well-being as he is for his family’s comfort. Take care of yourself. \n(For readers of this column in general: It is always OK to spend the holidays by yourself, if the prospect of fighting with your in-laws or family members seems both inevitable and impossible. There are worse things in the world than missing a single Thanksgiving or Christmas to stay at home with a good book or a good friend. “The holidays” can take on a mystical, sacred cast for some people, as if missing them once in awhile were some unforgivable violation of the social compact. They’re not. They’re just holidays. Give yourself permission to bow out, if things are looking dire.) \nQ. Friends or fetishes: Every few days I see an older white gentleman at my gym who is always accompanied by a much younger (I assume college-aged) guy of a particular ethnicity. It’s a different person each time but they’re all of the same ethnic background, and sometimes there are two guys with him. Whenever their conversation is within earshot it’s clear to me that the younger party is not very proficient in English. I assume whatever going on—if anything beyond mere companionship—is between consenting adults and is none of my business, but it does feel weird to me, particularly with the lack of English proficiency and the significant age gap. Am I wrong to take note of this man and his rotating selection of younger men? I can’t help but be a little creeped out. \nA: His behavior does not seem to merit comments from strangers. If you two were friends, and you wanted to have a conversation about fetishism, it might be an excellent opportunity to discuss the intersections of desire and tokenism and respect, but you don’t know him at all, and you haven’t heard him say anything inappropriate or disrespectful. I don’t think you should say anything to him. Advertisement \nQ. Re: How to retreat from the company retreat?: Mallory, you missed the point of this letter. She doesn’t want to go at all. So telling her to say she is looking forward to it isn’t going to help her at all. \nA: I understand not wanting to go, but I don’t want to encourage her to do something that might jeopardize her position—this may not be an optional company retreat. If she thinks she can get out of it without running into pushback, I think she should, but it may be a mandatory exercise, and if that’s the case, I want her to have some effective strategies for minimizing her discomfort. It doesn’t sound like the atmosphere at work is generally troubling, so I’m reluctant to encourage her to look for a new one on the strength of a single uncomfortable-sounding retreat (although if this company has a habit of encouraging hot-tub-centered team-building exercises, I’d certainly advise her to start applying elsewhere). \nQ. Re: How to retreat from the company retreat?: I think the LW should find a good excuse for not attending—something family-related with her husband. It’s not just the hot tub and drinking games she mentioned; it’s sharing rooms and bathrooms. This is totally inappropriate and a recipe for disaster. Even without the LW saying it, it was clear they DON’T have that HR department or I think this whole idea would have been nixed in the first place. \nA: Absolutely. I think my advice should be arranged in three tiers: The best option would be telling her boss she thinks it’s a bad idea to share bathrooms/living spaces, drink with her colleagues while staying in the same house, and share a hot tub, and that she’s not going to attend. The next best would be coming up with a plausible excuse for not going. If that’s not possible, and her boss is insisting on attendance, I think she should have a strategy in place for minimizing uncomfortable interactions. If this seems like an unusual exception to her work dynamic that results more from cluelessness than from a desire to manipulate younger female colleagues, there might be an opportunity to help her boss create a more welcoming work environment; if it’s in keeping with a general power imbalance between the older men and the younger women at work, she might want to push back and/or look for a job somewhere else.

(If it helps, we are both in our 40s and divorced.) I’m having trouble getting over it though I’m exercising, seeing friends, etc. We still text each other nearly daily and have occasionally met up as friends. I felt worse in the period where we were not talking right after the breakup. I find myself wanting to re-establish a romantic relationship. I would rather be with her and not married than without her. I don’t think she is open to it because our breakup was a very mean fight so I’m not sure if it makes sense to bring it up. What should I do? \nA: I think you should stop texting her. It doesn’t sound like there is any hope for reconciliation, so your primary focus should be on grieving the loss of your relationship and moving on, and I don’t think you can do so while remaining in constant contact with her. It’s very telling that you feel worse now, talking to her regularly, than you did when you two weren’t speaking. Tell her: “I can’t move on from our relationship while we’re still talking, so I’m not going to be able to maintain a friendship with you as long as I’m still getting over our breakup. I wish you all the best, but I can’t be your friend right now. Please respect my wishes and let me move on.” \nIf you’re worried she won’t honor your request, block her number and ask a friend or two to hold you accountable when it comes to contacting her. If—and this is such a remote contingency that i’m reluctant to bring it up for fear of giving you false hope—you two are ever going to re-establish a romantic connection, it can’t be as things are now. She dumped you cruelly because you wanted to get married. Even if you decide it’s worth foregoing marriage in order to be with you, you still need to address the power imbalance in your relationship, and you can’t do that by wanting less. If you two are ever going to reunite, it has to be on different terms, and it shouldn’t be simply because you can’t say “no” when she texts you. \nQ. Re: How to retreat from the company retreat?: There are so many red flags here. The mere fact that all of the women in the office are under 40 and all of the men are over 40 is suspicious. If none of the women showed up, do you really think the middle-aged men will sit around in the hot tub together? Every company retreat I’ve ever been on followed these rules: If it was staff only, it was held during regular business hours. If it was overnight, it was held at a hotel or resort of some type; spouses were invited (although the company might not have paid for their food etc.); and most of the team-building and other business activities were held during regular business hours. In both cases, if alcohol was involved, staff could purchase (or bring) their own, but it was never provided by the company. In my experience these have been standard practices since at least the 1990s. I would NOT go, and start looking for a new job. If none of the women showed up, do you really think the middle-aged men will sit around in the hot tub together? Advertisement \nA: I’ve gotten enough letters to the same effect that I think I should take your collective advice and amend my original response: Don’t go. This isn’t just a little off, it’s very off, and you should either claim a previously scheduled engagement or tell your boss why you won’t attend. Top Comment \ncan't the women all just say \"I don't want to drink or hot tub, I'm on my period\" and the older men will just back away slowly as though the young women might detonate with one wrong move?

The reasons have varied; the children were being disruptive during class, the teacher didn’t finish the lesson in time, they went to the computer lab instead, etc. I am very concerned about this. Children that age need a break during the day to run around and get out all that excess energy. They’ve already cut PE to once a week and now they don’t have recess anymore? Is this a big enough issue for me to bring it up to the teacher (possibly the principal?) or should I let it go and take my son to the park after school? \nA: I don’t see why you can’t bring it up with the teacher. Say, “My son tells me that the class hasn’t had recess over the last two weeks, and I’m concerned about it. Can you tell me the reasoning behind this decision?” Maybe he’s misunderstood something, maybe it’s a temporary response to a scheduling issue, maybe it’s a decision you disagree with and will want to discuss with other parents. You have every right to ask questions about your son’s schedule. \nMallory Ortberg: Thanks, everyone! Remember that bailing on THE HOLIDAYS is not always the first or best option, but it is always an option. No one will die if you don’t eat turkey with them on a particular Thursday.",

    "text": "Jamaica Jamaica police commit 'hundreds of unlawful killings' yearly, Amnesty says \nEvidence gathered by human rights activists suggests state authorities order or are complicit in deaths amid ‘shocking culture of fear and violence’ Mario Deane died after being beaten in a police lockup. Photograph: Handout   15.11 GMT Last modified on   15.33 GMT View more   \nPolice officers in Jamaica carry out unlawful killings on the orders of state authorities or with their complicity, evidence gathered by Amnesty International suggests. \nResearch by the human rights organisation points to a strong likelihood that state-sponsored executions take place in the country, a report published on Wednesday said. \nAmnesty welcomed recent reductions in the numbers of civilians killed by police in Jamaica, but said that officers perpetuated a culture of fear in which evidence was tampered with, witnesses were terrorised and intimidated and weapons were planted on victims of police killings . \n“Jamaica’s shocking culture of fear and violence is allowing police officers to get away with hundreds of unlawful killings every year. Shocking injustice is the norm,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. \n“Unlawful killings of young men and terrorizing their relatives into silence seems to be the alternative to proper investigations into crimes. Over the last two decades, Jamaica’s ‘fight violence with violence’ approach to crime is not only short-sighted but has proven utterly ineffective in tackling the root causes of violence.” \nThe report Waiting in Vain: Unlawful Police Killings and Relatives’ Long Struggle for Justice said: “Information gathered … points to a strong likelihood of the existence of individual police officers or even units tasked with carrying out extrajudicial executions on the orders of some governmental authorities or with its complicity or acquiescence.” \nSince 2000, members of the Jamaican constabulary force (JCF) have allegedly killed 3,000 people, according to figures from Amnesty and Indecom , the police watchdog body. Jamaica's police at last being called to account for killings of civilians Read more \nPolice killings have been decreasing in frequency since Indecom began its work in 2010. Last year, 101 people were allegedly killed by officers, compared to 210 in in 2011 and 258 in 2013. \nBut Amnesty said there had been limited progress in addressing police impunity, lack of accountability and policing methods that fall far short of international standards. Three out of every five people shot by police died from their injuries. Between January and October 2016, 92 people were killed by law enforcement officials – an average of two killings by police a week. \nThe report said longstanding practices of tampering with evidence, leaving victims to “bleed out” and the use of unlawful killings as an alternative to arrest and lengthy criminal proceedings continued. \nThe mother of Mario Deane, who died after a severe beating in a police lockup, told researchers she could barely recognize her son’s swollen and disfigured face when she was initially told by police that he had “fallen off his bunk”, the report said. \nThe brother of another victim, Nakiea Jackson, witnessed police dragging his limp body by its feet to a police vehicle, throwing it in the back, and driving off. In other cases, family members were witnesses to direct threats by police officers to their relatives, who were later killed by police. People protest against the police killing of Akieem Stewart in Cheshire Village, Kingston, Jamaica, in 2015. Photograph: Collect for the Guardian \nEvidence suggests single police officers were often responsible for multiple killings. According to Indecom, in one case a single police officer has been implicated in 22 separate police shootings. \nIn 2013, the watchdog charged 13 officers operating out of the Clarendon division with murder after receiving information, from a former police informant and other witnesses, that police officers in Clarendon were selected by senior police officers for the specific objective of murdering people. It is alleged that the officers killed 60 people over a number of years. They have yet to come to trial. \nThe work of Indecom is cited by some as a reason for the reduction in police killings, but Amnesty said the watchdog was constantly being challenged by the police and other state bodies and a special criminal court set up to conduct inquests into alleged police killings was chronically underfunded. By 2013, the special coroner’s court had a backlog of 300 cases. \nThe police watchdog has charged nearly 100 officers with offences, but chronic delays meant only eight cases had been completed and one murder conviction secured. \nAmnesty International interviewed more than 50 relatives of 28 people believed to have been unlawfully killed by the police between 2003 and 2014. The report said: “Most had experienced intense and pervasive harassment and intimidation by police in their pursuit of justice, causing them further mental suffering. In some of the cases documented for this report, police treatment of victims’ families constitutes cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment.” \nAmnesty made a series of recommendations, including calling for: the Jamaican parliament to condemn extrajudicial and unlawful killings by police, an increase in Indecom’s budget, Jamaica to sign the international Convention Against Torture, police reform and for the immediate removal of all officers and units involved in fatal shootings to assess their future suitability for deployment. \n“If authorities in Jamaica are serious about tackling the country’s shocking levels of police killings and violence, they must urgently promote a deep police and justice reform to address not only the number of police murders but the root causes of the problem,” said Guevara-Rosas. \nMany relatives of the dead told researchers police stigmatized their communities for being poor. \nAmnesty said witnesses repeatedly told them: “They have no respect,” “They kick off doors, without a warrant,” “If you try and answer them back they try and brutalize you and accuse you of attacking the police,” “The government gives them power to kill we.” \nOne woman said: “Some of dem come in their uniform. But when they come to kill yuh pickney [your child], they take off their badge… and they come in a mask ... ”",

My blood pressure was through the roof. \n“I didn’t care, I had given up. I used to be a bubbly person, I just wasn’t who I wanted to be. \n“I could see people look at me from across the street kind of like, ‘Woah, look at the size of her’ I wanted to shout at them that I had a health condition but I didn’t, I was just greedy. \n“I was depressed and was on anti-depressants. \n“I spent 10 months after the hospital feeling sorry for myself.” Read More She lost her business and hit the gym - now she's a Miss UK bikini champion and has landed her dream job Alison with daughter Michaela (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) \nEverything changed when Alison’s daughter-in-law Abby asked if she could watch her three-year-old grandson Joseph when Abby went back to work. \nAlison said: “I was over the moon that she asked. \n“I started to think about taking him to the park, on walks and swimming. \n“I couldn’t even bend over, I was so out of condition. \n“My daughter-in-law asked me to do Slimming World and I said I would think about it. \n“I knew I had to do this.

Credit: © zuki70 / Fotolia Close Scientists are one step closer to understanding the link between different diet strategies and gut health, with new research presenting the first general principles for how diet impacts the microbiota. \nResearchers from the University of Sydney have found that the availability of intestinal nitrogen to microbes in the gut plays a key role in regulating interactions between gut microbes and their host animal. The study is published today in Cell Metabolism and led by researchers at the University of Sydney's Charles Perkins Centre. \n\"There are many different diet strategies that claim to promote gut health, and until now it has been very difficult to establish clear causality between various types of diet and their effect on the host's microbiome. This is because there are many complex factors at play, including food composition, eating pattern and genetic background,\" said lead author Associate Professor Andrew Holmes, from the Charles Perkins Centre and School of Life and Environmental Sciences. \n\"This research really lays the groundwork for future modelling by setting out the rules for a general model of how diet shapes the gut ecosystem. The simple explanation is that when we eat in a way that encourages cooperation between ourselves and bacteria we achieve a good microbiome, but when we eat in a way that doesn't require cooperation this lets bacteria do whatever they want -- and mischief can ensue.\" \nThe balance of gut bacteria in the microbiome plays a key role in such functions as immune regulation and digestive wellbeing, and has been linked to other health outcomes like obesity. Past studies have identified several patterns for how diet influences the microbiome, yet this has not led to a workable model that explains microbial response across many different types of diets. \nThis new research is the latest in a series stemming from a seminal study in which 25 different diets composed of different amounts of protein, carbohydrates and fat were systematically varied in 858 mice. \nDespite the huge diversity of gut bacteria, two main response patterns emerged in the study -- microbe species either increased or decreased in their abundance depending on the animal's protein and carbohydrate intake. \n\"The largest nutrient requirements for our gut bacteria are carbon and nitrogen in the foods we eat. As carbohydrates contain no nitrogen but protein does, the bacterial community response to the host animal's diet is strongly affected by this diets' protein-carbohydrate ratio,\" said Associate Professor Holmes. \n\"The fact that this same pattern was seen across almost all groups of gut bacteria indicates that the makeup of the microbial ecosystem is fundamentally shaped by a need to access nitrogen in the intestinal environment.\" \nThe researchers' new model suggests that while high-carbohydrate diets were the most likely to support positive interactions in the microbiome, such benefits were relative to the protein intake of the host animal. \nResearchers hope the new findings will lay the foundations for more accurate computer simulations to test hundreds of different diet variants, helping to better predict which dietary combinations lead to optimal gut health. \n\"There are many ways to achieve a good diet, and the same diet won't work in the same way in each person,\" said co-author Professor Stephen Simpson, Academic Director of the Charles Perkins Centre. \n\"The next step will be to more rapidly characterise which dietary combinations promote the best outcomes for each of our gut microbiomes, and to this end we are developing a computer simulation for how this might work in practice.\" \n  University of Sydney   Andrew J.

    "text": "BEIJING: China has ordered all residents in its Muslim-majority Xinjiang province to surrender their passports in a bid to \"maintain social order\" and prevent them from moving abroad, days after the Communist nation tightened rules to suppress religious freedom in the restive region. \n\nThe northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has tightened passport regulations, requiring all residents to hand in their passports to local police for examination and management, state-run Global Times reported today. \n\nAll citizens in Aksu prefecture are required to hand their passports - private or official - to local police stations, the daily reported quoting an anonymous police officer. \n\n\"Anyone who needs the passport must apply to the police station,\" the official said, adding that the new passport management policy is implemented throughout Xinjiang. \n\nThe Public Security Bureau in Shihezi city gave the same directive last month saying it was for \"annual examination\" purposes. \"Those who refuse to hand in their passports should bear the responsibility themselves if they are forbidden from going abroad,\" the directive said. \n\nA resident from Kashar city, bordering Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), told the daily she received a call asking her to hand over her passport to police. She said her husband's passport application was denied by the police a few days ago. \n\nA local official told the daily that Xinjiang government had loosened control over residents' passports in 2015. The new policy is aimed at maintaining social order, he said. \n\nThe latest directive follows an order reported yesterday, requiring all residents to report to authorities all religious activities, including circumcision, weddings and funerals. \n\nGetting a passport is often complicated and takes more time in Xinjiang than in other provinces, given the increased threat of terrorism in the region and the government's ongoing anti-terrorism campaign, an official in the province said. \n\nThe passport policy also comes amid steady migration of Uyghurs, Turkik-speaking Muslims to Turkey and other nations. \n\nAccording to reports, hundreds of Uyghur youths have been fighting along with the Islamic State group in Syria, and China believes that the battle-hardened militants may return to cause more violence in the troubled province. \n\nThe resource-rich Xinjiang, bordering PoK and Afghanistan, has been on the boil for more than six years as the local Uyghur Muslims are upset over over the increasing settlement of Han Chinese from other provinces. \n\nThe province has witnessed some of the most deadly terrorist attacks, officially blamed on East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), which was previously linked to the al-Qaeda but now has declared its allegiance to Islamic State. \n\nETIM was blamed for a suicide attack on the Chinese Embassy in Kyrgyzstan in September.

A firefighter surveys the damage from a fire in Haifa. (photo credit:REUTERS)   \nDespite the relative calm, firefighters are still patrolling Haifa’s streets, remaining on a 24 hours on/24 hours off shift instead of the usual 24 on/48 off work schedule.“Right now everything is a bit calmer, there are not a lot of fires, just hot spots, nothing we can’t handle,” Haifa firefighter Eitan Ripps, 37, told The Jerusalem Post by phone from one of the city’s fire stations on Saturday. “It is not easy, it has been a lot of days away from home – not seeing the family kids – but you know, we’ll get through this together.”   According to Ripps, who has been in the line of duty for 13 years, the recent fires were the most dangerous he has seen. (Fires in Israel) “The last time it was the 2010 [Mount] Carmel [forest] fire but even the oldest firefighters, who have been here for 40 years never saw anything like what happened [last week],” remarked Ripps. “It is not like a forest fire, everything was inside the city.”A Haifa fire department spokesman told the Post that the biggest challenge was dealing with the scale of the urban fire.“It makes a big difference because when you are dealing with protecting lives it is obviously a much bigger challenge than protecting trees,” he said.Tel Aviv firefighter Yaakov “Grizzly” Guttman, 32, who spent the week fighting fires in Zichron Ya’acov and in Sha’ar Hagai, west of Jerusalem, was recovering on Saturday night after a grueling week and preparing to go back on call on Sunday.“I felt a huge sense of honor. I never faced anything this size, everybody pushed their limits,” said Guttman, who worked an almost 72-hour shift. “Seeing five- or seven-meter high flames and knowing that if this gets past you it is going to hit citizens and civilians – I felt a huge sense of honor.”For Guttman, the greatest challenge was keeping in contact with his wife, who is due to give birth in two weeks.“My phone went completely dead for a few days,” he said. “You want to be with your family and your friends, but you also have a massive responsibility to the people and to the country.”Fire and Rescue Authority spokesman Yoram Levi told the Post on Saturday the fires have been largely extinguished.“Basically it is over,” he said, adding “we are preparing ourselves for a few more days with extreme weather conditions.”  ",

    "text": "Net migration to be 80,000 a year lower after Brexit, OBR says Immigration and passport control, Terminal 2, Heathrow Airport, London, United Kingdom Credit: wronaphoto.com / Alamy Ben Riley-Smith , Assistant Political Editor  14pm \nB ritain’s net migration will be 80,000 a year lower after leaving the EU, the country’s independent forecaster has said. \nThe Office of Budget Responsibility [OBR] said net immigration will be 185,000 a year rather than the 265,000 a year that was expected. \nThe news was welcomed by Eurosceptics who argued it “vindicated” their calls during the referendum that leaving the EU would help curb migration. \nThere will however be knock-on effects to the economy, with an extra £16bn of borrowing estimated to be needed until 2020 to cover the drop. \nDespite the reduction in immigration, the Tories are still forecast to miss their target of lowering net migration to below 100,000 after Brexit. Watch | Michael Gove says points based immigration system is fair 01:17 \nP hilip Hammond, the Chancellor, has admitted that a “longer time frame” than five years was needed to hit the target. \nIt is one of the first times a Tory front-bencher has conceded that net migration will not drop into the \"tens of thousands\" by the 2020 election. \nDuring the referendum those arguing to leave the EU put the ability to bring down migration at the heart of their pitch to voters. \nBoris Johnson and Michael Gove repeatedly attacked the Tory leadership for saying the pledge could be hit while remaining in the EU. \n“It is deeply corrosive of popular trust in politics that every year people in power say they can cut immigration to tens of thousands and then fail,” Mr Johnson said before the vote. Autumn Statement | Key points \n“We have absolutely no power to control the number of people coming. I am in favour of immigration but also in favour of control.” \nF or the first time since the Brexit vote, the OBR has revealed what it expects to happen to immigration in the coming years. \nLeaving the EU will bring “lower net migration than would otherwise have been the case”, the OBR said. \nThe body said there would be “tighter” controls on migration and that “pull factors attracting migrants to the UK may be less powerful than previously”. \nNet migration will be 80,000 a year lower than expected as a result, the OBR said. Without the Brexit vote net migration was expected to drop to 265,000 a year beyond 2020. Instead it will fall to 185,000 a year. \nAndrew Bridgen, the Tory MP for North West Leicestershire who backed Brexit, said the lower immigration forecast “vindicates the claims made by the Leave side in the referendum debate”. \nLord Green of Deddington, the chairman of Migration Watch, said: “If the main reduction in immigration is achieved by cutting out low paid immigrants from the EU, as we have proposed, there is no reason to think that there will be a significant reduction in revenue because these workers pay little or no tax.” \nThe projections do not specifically take into account a new work permits scheme being planned by the Home Office, the details of which are yet to be announced. At a glance | What does JAM mean? \nM rs May has repeatedly said that Britain voted for “control” over its borders at the referendum – suggesting she backs a yearly cap on the number of EU nationals who can move to the UK. \nSpeaking in the House of Commons, Mr Hammond appeared to concede that the Government would miss its ambition to bring net migration below 100,000 a year before the 2020 election. \nAlison McGovern, the Labour MP for Wirral South, asked whether Mr Hammond had asked the OBR to “adjust” their migration forecasts because it showed the Tory target will be missed. \nMr Hammond responded: “No. The Prime Minister’s been very clear that it remains her target to achieve immigration reduced to the tens of thousands. But she’s also been clear that it will take time to achieve. \n“The OBR forecast stretches over a period of five years and the Prime Minister is absolutely clear that this is a target that will be achieved over a longer time frame in order to manage the impact on the economy.” Follow Telegraph News",

    "text": "VOICES Why Modi is the champion of rollbacks The average citizen is finding it hard to keep track of the U-turns on what one can and cannot do with one's own money. 3149 @ashoupadhyay On November 23, when parties like Trinamool Congress and AAP vehemently opposed the demonetisation drive and demanded its rollback, Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu said rollbacks have no place in Narendra Modi's book. Addressing a \"mahapanchayat\" of Delhi Dehat Kisan Mazdoor in the capital, he said, \"Wapas lena Modi ji ke khoon mein nahi hai\". On November 8, while announcing the decision to demonetise these two notes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said, \"From 10th November till 24th November the limit for such exchange (of old notes) will be four thousand rupees. From 25th November till 30th December, the limit will be increased.\" On November 17, this decision was amended. People were allowed to exchange only Rs 2,000 as limit got reduced. On November 24, the Centre announced that the exchange of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes for new currency was being stopped at all banks. So, while Modi promised the nation that the exchange limit would be increased from November 24, he actually stopped it on the same date. And so he did go back on one of his promises yet one of his ministers said, \" Wapas lena Modi ji ke khoon mein nahi hai! \" The government has, on an average, reversed its own rules at a rate of three times a day. Credit: PTI This is not the first change made by the Modi government since the demonetisation drive kicked off on November 8. So far, 50 decisions in 17 days have been taken by the government on demonetisation and, it has, on an average reversed its own rules at a rate of three times a day. Both the number and intensity of changes are so high that very few lawmakers would be aware of them. The average citizen is finding it hard to keep track of all the decisions on what one can and cannot do with one's own money. The BJP may say that rolling back is not in Modi's blood but several U-turns of the government on different aspects of demonetisation defy their claim. The Narendra Modi government seems to be in the habit of rolling back decisions. One newspaper report counted 25 U-turns in the first 180 days of Narendra Modi.Land Acquisition was one of the biggest examples of flip-flops and rollbacks of Modi government. His Pakistan policy too has seen several flip-flop-flips like the time when talks were cancelled after their envoy called a meeting with Hurriyat leaders ahead of the India-Pakistan bilateral talks only to change its stance later. The decision to ban websites which contained pornographic material was revoked after facing the wrath of netizens. In the last Union Budget, the government had turned 60 per cent of the corpus in EPF into a taxable component, but after facing unprecedented flak, that too was rolled back. These were but a few examples there have been many more and while many of Modi government's decisions were ill-conceived and had to be retracted later, others were rolled back when the government succumbed to public and political pressure. Every government does it and there is nothing wrong in accepting one's mistakes or amending decisions or policies. But making frequent U-turns and yet saying that rolling back is not in Narendra Modi's blood is definitely stretching things beyond acceptability or as one would say in Hindi, Venkaiahji, Yeh baat kuch hazam nahi hui. #Demonetisation , #Modi government The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

    "text": "Relaxing on a hammock at the top deck of his 17.5-metre boat anchored 200 metres off Sam Mun Tsai pier in Tai Po district, retiree Jacky Leung soaks up the view of blue skies and green peaks around Plover Clove. Leung lives in a flat with his family, but chooses to sleep on the boat two to three nights a week. Who can blame him? He has 1,500 sq ft of space here – compared to 300 sq ft at home – that costs only HK$1,500 a month for anchorage.\nLeung believes life afloat could be an ideal stopgap measure for young couples struggling to find affordable housing. But his advert offering the floating home for lease landed him in hot water with the Marine Department earlier this year.\nOfficials informed him that, as the holder of a leisure boat licence, a long-term accommodation arrangement with a third party would breach hotel and guest house regulations. Had his boat been moored in the more exclusive environs of a yacht club, he’d probably have escaped scrutiny from the department’s patrol vessels. \n“I have friends who’ve had to remain apart since they got married, and others living in subdivided flats. Why can’t they buy a boat to live on?” says Leung, who bought his for HK$300,000 several years ago, and points out that a car parking space costs about HK$1 million.\nLeung says he had also hoped to help revive the centuries-old tradition of living at sea in Hong Kong, where fishing was a major industry until the 1960s, when more than 10,000 boats plied their trade.\nA tough crew: Hong Kong fishermen tell their life stories to young generation \nAs fishing and agriculture waned into relative insignificance amid the boom in manufacturing and service industries, and a series of fires and typhoons wreaked havoc among fisherfolk, the city’s boat dwellers began migrating into public housing estates. According to the Marine Department, only four “squatter boat” licences remain valid from that era. \nThe shortage of housing has been a perennial hot button issue for the Hong Kong administration, and flat prices have become increasingly out of reach for many residents – especially the young.\nAccording to government statistics, more than 90 per cent of Hongkongers under the age of 25 still live with their parents. To be eligible for public housing, single applicants must earn no more than HK$10,970 per month. Even when the requirement is met, it can be take more than 10 years to be allocated a flat because the elderly and families top the waiting list.\nYoung singles in Hong Kong deprived of basic right to public housing, judicial review hears \nYoung people who came out onto the streets during the 2014 Occupy protests citied the inability to live independently due to exorbitant property prices as a major grievance – although it was essentially a protest against the failure of political reform.\nSeeking to address the problem, the government announced a scheme that same year to build hostels in Jordan, Mong Kok, Sheung Wan and Tai Po, with rooms for let to young people at a discount to the market rate. The hostels are still under construction and no date has been given for their completion.\nAccountant Hugo Kwok and friends have come up with a solution to help young couples move out of their parents’ homes until they can find a more private solution. In April they formed a collective called Tai Tung Co-housing, to help young couples cohabit apartments with other couples. The rent per person is about HK$3,000.\nAn estate agency is on board, one that previously helped landlords turn their apartments into hostels for students. Each couple gets their own bedroom with basic furnishings including a bed and wardrobe. \nWriting in the Hong Kong Economic Journal , Kwok says the concept of co-living also entails joint responsibility for household chores.\n“Besides sharing facilities such as the kitchen, living room and toilet, co-housers must assume different responsibilities, including cooking and cleaning. By sharing facilities, people can build a closer relationship with their flatmates, and improve their social lives and living environment,” Kwok says. \nIn recent years, a culture of co-living arrangements for friends has taken root in Tokyo and Taipei, crowded cities that face housing problems similar to Hong Kong’s. 9floor Co-space in Taipei accommodates about 60 flatmates in 10 apartments.\nKwok writes that co-housing is an appropriate lifestyle option for young people living in a modern capitalist society.\nHong Kong think tank believes subsidised homeownership scheme would help fix ‘unjust’ public housing policy \n“Our target is people who can’t afford rent ... and want to meet more new people to expand their social network. By sharing rent, their cost of living can be reduced. Many people think that they don’t want to interact with others after work. They think that a home should be a totally private space for relaxation. [But] if interpersonal relationships are confined to only the work environment, will people become more alienated and self-centred in their downtime?”\nIn October, the Hong Kong Council of Social Service, a federation representing about 400 NGOs, floated the idea of temporary housing estates built using converted shipping containers. They could be developed in abandoned car parks or under flyovers, and serve as a temporary measure to relieve the housing problem, it said. \nThe council’s idea is based on a concept pioneered in the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, which launched a scheme to provide temporary student housing more than a decade ago. The stacked containers, each measuring about 200 sq ft, are insulated and fitted with a bathroom, open kitchen, air conditioner and windows. The homes can withstand most climatic conditions, according to planners.\nCheap Hong Kong-designed ‘container homes’ the way of the future \nVincent Ng, president of the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, says there needs to be a multipronged, long-term approach to tackling the city’s housing shortage. \n“In 30 years working as an architect, I’ve seen people’s homes getting smaller and smaller. Property developers see housing as a commodity to maximise their profits, instead of a place for people to live,” he says.\n“Such unconventional living concepts as shipping containers are not new. The idea was proposed by academics some years ago. For such temporary housing, you have to find land to house them. And you have to go through the Town Planning Board and [district councils] and so on.\n“At some point in the future, you have to relocate the people living there, so it needs a comprehensive plan … The time needed to complete all those procedures might be similar to that for construction of a public housing estate. In the long term, the government has to identify land for constructing permanent housing for common people, not luxury property buyers.”\nHong Kong’s country park land not the solution for housing shortage \nBoating enthusiast Leung, who worked in the maritime trade before retirement, is adamant that living on the water should not be ruled out in Hong Kong, although he concedes it’s not a long-term solution – especially for landlubbers who get seasick.\nAcquiring a leisure boat licence is easy, he says. “You just need to know how to swim a short distance and finish an exam paper of multiple-choice questions. “Afterwards, you get an instructor to teach you how to pilot the boat. It’s easier than playing video games.”\nIt’s not all plain sailing, though, Leung admits. There are practical concerns, such as water and electricity supply, but he overcame them using his nous. He had solar panels installed on the top deck to provide electricity for a fridge, heater and stove. A diesel generator powers hungrier appliances, such as the air conditioner, but he says he rarely uses it.\nSegro tackles London housing shortage with homes-cum-warehouses approach \nLeung also built a water retention pool on the boat’s roof, connected to pipes extending downstairs to the kitchen and toilet. “A downpour can yield more than 2,000 litres of water, enough for my whole family of four for a week. I can also go ashore to get water, but it’s troublesome,” he says.\n“The biggest difficulty is the need for a feeder boat to go ashore. I have one myself which I bought for tens of thousands of dollars some years ago.”\nOn the October day we visit, the roof of the boat is blistering hot because his tarpaulin cover had been destroyed during a typhoon. Leung says other maintenance costs have been negligible.\n“Renewing my leisure boat licence costs only HK$2,000 a year, and insurance sets me back HK$5,000 a year.”\nIt’s all worth it, he says. “I lived near the Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter when I was young, so I’ve always loved the sea. I love jumping into the water after I wake up, and looking at the starry night sky from the deck.”",

    "text": "Zero Waste Living: Everything You Need to Know How to reduce your impact on the environment 28/11/2016 11:17 Susan Devaney \nFrom clothes and food to stuff , how many times per week do you throw out unloved, unwanted or unused waste? The simple answer lies in your bin. \nAs scientists continue to tell us our planet is getting hotter at an alarming rate, 2016 is a time for big changes, starting at home. According to Rutland County Council , on average every person in the UK throws away their own body weight in rubbish every 7 weeks. From green and brown to blue, households across the planet are successfully adopting a colour-coded recycling scheme to try to reduce our carbon footprint. \nBut leaders of a zero-waste lifestyle movement are challenging the notion that we could (and should) be doing more, and proving it’s possible. \nLast year, New Yorker Lauren Singer packed her annual waste into one, small glass jar. How did she do it? Lauren Singer \n“Whether it is saying no to single use plastic straws wherever you go or opting to always carry a reusable tote bag, there are lots of easy things to do that have a long term and large scale positive environmental (and economic) impact,” says Singer, Founder of Trash is for Tossers and CEO of The Simply Co . \nKeeping in mind that each UK household produces over 1 tonne of rubbish annually, amounting to about 31 million tonnes each year – not including the rest of our planet’s waste – the small things really do matter. “I started small and did a few things at a time so it wasn’t overwhelming. I made toothpaste for the first time because I was out of toothpaste and didn’t want to buy another tube. I didn’t make any other new product until I finished the store bought one that I had. Doing things that way really helped to pace out the things that I was doing and make them super easy and fun,” explains Singer. Trash Is For Tossers \nLauren’s blog is full of helpful tips and detailed advice for minimising waste like storing dry food in jars and using bamboo compostable toothbrushes. It also lists easy ways to adjust your weekly shopping list to help reduce your carbon footprint. And that means asking for your fresh fish to be put into a glass jar you brought along with you – a zero-waste lifestyle means saying no to plastic packaging for good. \nShe’s not the only one. Young millennial women are actively reducing their household waste on a phenomenal scale. As Europe vows to reduce our GHG (Greenhouse Gas Emissions) by 20 percent by 2020 and by 40 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 , addressing our household waste is the key to it’s success. \n“We eat fresh, simple, and healthful meals instead of spending a lot on takeout and disposables, and walk or bike instead of spending a lot on cabs. Making my own simple household and beauty products frees up money and time for things I really enjoy,” says Ariana Schwarz of Paris to Go . Paris To Go \nMaking the switch in 2014, Schwarz (like Singer) started making small adjustments to her daily life, going back to her old lifestyle now seems impossible. “Drink tap water, pack a few reusable shopping bags in your car or purse, try a bamboo toothbrush, bring lunch instead of buying in the cafeteria, and eat meatless one day a week (even better if you eat vegan). These all require minimal adjustment, but can have a major impact on an individual’s carbon footprint,” says Schwarz. Paris To Go \nThe secret formula is if you have less, you waste less. What’s there to lose? \n\nLearn more about sustainability, visit Electrify the World – a Nissan Intelligent Mobility Initiative Learn more about sustainability, visit Electrify The World - A Nissan Mobility Initiative More:",

Show” involving Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. \n“Gronk’s on his way out (of New England),” the former New York Jets linebacker told host Damon Amendolara. “Because of injuries, and they don’t stick with you when they see you slipping. When you have a big man that starts having back problems — he’s only in his seventh year, and he has two years remaining. And guess what? They already brought in his replacement and they can get him for cheaper.” \nThat’s right: Scott believes the Patriots are ready to cut ties with Gronkowski, insisting they already have a serviceable tight end in Martellus Bennett, who’s actually two years older than the 27-year-old All-Pro. \n“Don’t matter. Less wear and tear on the body,” Scott said of Bennett. “Listen, we had some great players in basketball. When did you know it was over with Larry Bird? When he would go to the sideline and put that hot pack on his back.” \nGronkowski left Sunday’s game against the Jets with a back injury and already has missed three of New England’s 11 games this season. He’s still the NFL’s best tight end when healthy, though, leading all qualified tight ends with 21.6 yards per catch this season. \nBut don’t tell that to Scott, who predicts Belichick will give Gronk the same treatment he gave Jamie Collins and Chandler Jones . \n“We talk about knee injuries, back injuries, elbow brace forever,” Scott said, trailing off. “Listen, man, you think Bill Belichick (is) going to stick with you? Negative. He’s not in the foxhole with you.” \nThumbnail photo via Robert Deutsch/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Darren Hartwell? Send it to him via Twitter at @darren_hartwell . ",

    "text": "Next step set for £7m Porthcawl maritime centre 29 November 2016 Image copyright Porthcawl Harbourside Image caption Artist's impression of the maritime centre and harbour area from above A planned £7m maritime centre for the south Wales seaside town of Porthcawl is set to take a big step forward as its backers prepare to launch a search for contractors to build it. \nPorthcawl Harbourside said work should begin in mid 2017, with the building expected to open by 2018 or 2019. \nIt will house water sport and exercise facilities, a coastal science centre, a cafe and an outdoor theatre. \nThe project was awarded a £1.1m Heritage Lottery grant in October. \nThe money will go towards developing the land, which is owned by Bridgend council. \nPorthcawl Harbourside was formed by a collaboration between the Welsh Surfing Federation and Porthcawl Sea Cadets with involvement from two of the now-directors, town councillor and former mayor Mike Clarke and Stuart Bentley, a resident with a background in architecture. \nMr Clarke said the Cosy Corner site where the centre would be built - named after the former Cosy Cinema which stood on the area along with a skating rink - will reflect its history as a \"bustling centre of activity and a magnet for tourists\". Image caption Cosy Corner is next to the lifeboat station and the Jennings building (left), which is being renovated Image caption The former site of a cinema, skating rink and paddling pool Image copyright Porthcawl Museum Image caption In previous decades the area had fountains in the central water feature Image copyright Porthcawl Museum Image caption Later on, it was a paddling pool, as pictured in this postcard from the late 60s or early 70s \nOperations manager Mark Bryant told BBC Wales the group expected to get to the procurement stage \"this side of Christmas\" when an invitation to tender would go out to find a contractor to build the centre. \nAccording to Mr Bryant, support from the local community has been \"incredible\". \n\"We couldn't have done it without them. They've been instrumental in getting it off the ground,\" he said. \n\"We're working with the Chamber of Commerce to the Civic Trust to the YMCA. They've all been really supportive. \n\"The whole town has really come together behind it.\" \nHe said a key philosophy behind the project, which is run on a not-for-profit basis, was social benefits for the whole community. The centre is aiming to offer 50 full-time equivalent jobs. Image copyright Porthcawl Harbourside Image caption The centre promises science and sporting facilities as well as workspaces and a cafe \nThe site will offer a coastal maritime science and discovery centre, including environmental, culture, local history and community learning in partnership with Swansea University, and a public viewing gallery nicknamed the crow's nest with a camera obscura - which allows people to look out to sea - and facilities for lifeguards and emergency services. \nThe National Governing Body of Surfing in Wales and the Sea Cadets will be based there, along with a Welsh surf museum, a gym, training pool, water sport facilities with toilets and shower facilities and conference space for up to 100 people. \nThere will also be an indoor gallery and an outdoor amphitheatre, along with office space, accommodation and a cafe/bistro open into the evening, which Mr Bryant said would be a training cafe offering opportunities for catering students. \nThe harbour area of the town is one of the places where work has progressed in recent years, while other schemes to regenerate the town centre have stalled. Image caption The Jennings building is being redeveloped as a workspace and restaurant \nIn a separate development, work began in September on restoring the Grade II-listed Jennings building which has overlooked the harbour for more than 180 years. \nThe developers, ABA Holdings, are converting it into commercial units, with a theatre-style restaurant and bar and 13 home studios with bedrooms which will allow people to live and work on site. \nThose units are already rented, according to the council. \nResponses from the local community have been positive in the main, although there have been some concerns raised about a lack of parking associated with the project. \nJo Richards, whose family has run Walters Shoes in Porthcawl for 140 years, said the project was a \"great thing\" for the town. \n\"I think it will be great for footfall in the town, which a small town like Porthcawl always needs,\" she said. \n\"There hasn't been any major non-commercial development for a long time. Almost everyone has welcomed it.\" \nSophie Evans, who works at the Marine Hotel on the seafront, said: \"I think it's a good idea because it will bring more people to Porthcawl. Particularly if it brings more people in the winter months, because that's when we need people. \n\"It will will be good to have something there because when my parents were younger it was busy. It doesn't seem like it's used much.\"",

In 2013, there were an estimated one million people living with colon and rectum cancer America, according to government figures . \nLindsay's account - which begins 'dear every cancer patient I ever took care of, I’m sorry. I didn’t get it' - has resonated with thousands and inspired hundreds to share their own experiences with cancer. \nDespite having been involved in 'countless' diagnosis conversations, she admitted: 'I didn't get what it felt like to actually hear the words.' \nShe added: 'You probably went home and broke down under the weight of what you had just been told. \n'You probably sat in silence and disbelief for hours until you had to go pretend everything was fine at work or wherever because you didn’t have any details yet and wanted to keep it private still. \n'You probably didn’t even know where to start and your mind went straight to very dark places. That day was the worst. I’m sorry. I didn’t get it.' \nShe also confessed to not having known 'how hard the waiting is', the 'awkward' experience of telling others the life-changing news and what it feels like 'to get sad looks all the time'. \nShe added: 'I didn’t get how much you hung on to every word I said to you...I didn’t get how much you googled.' \nLindsay said she had not been aware of how strange it felt to be referred to as 'brave'. \nNew perspective: The 33-year-old said her diagnosis has transformed her understanding of what it is like to live with the disease\nBalancing act: Lindsay, who is in the first stage of treatment, is still working full-time and is mother to Evelyn, seven months, and Harrison, three\n'Getting treatment because I have to doesn’t really make me feel like much of a hero,' she added. \nEnding the open letter, Lindsay said 'nobody' knows what it is like to be a cancer patient but that she hopes she able to provide her patients with 'a little guidance and strength' to help them through the ordeal. \nLindsay - who is still working full-time and is mother to Evelyn, seven months, and Harrison, three - said she wrote the letter because since her diagnosis she kept thinking about how she treated patients. \nShe told Daily Mail Online: 'I couldn’t help thinking back to all the questions I got from patients and wondering if I did enough or if I said the wrong thing. \n'Every step I’ve taken through the process so far has been eye opening, making me realize “oh, so this is what they were talking about “ or “so this is how this feels”. \n'I just feel like I could relate in a different way and I was inspired to write about my new perspective.' \nLindsay is currently undergoing radiation and oral chemotherapy daily. When that is complete she will have a six week break before having surgery in January followed by another six week break and four months of IV chemotherapy. \nShe said: 'I’m stage three, so thankfully it’s not spread to other parts of my body, but the risk of recurrence is very real so I’ll be watched very closely for the years to come.' \nWorking is a 'great distraction', she said, but balancing treatment, work and family life can be challenging. \nNot prepared: Despite having been involved in 'countless' diagnosis conversations, she admitted that she 'didn't get what it felt like to actually hear the words'\nSupport: She said her husband Camden, 37, who works in sales, is her 'rock'\nShe said her husband Camden, 37, who works in sales, is her 'rock'. \nShe added: 'He’s picked up most of the housework and taking care of the kids as much as possible to give me rest. \n'Trying to keep up with my own expectations of being a good mother is probably the hardest part, but just spending time with them is the best medicine. \n'I’ve learned it’s OK if the house isn’t perfect - we have each other.' \nShe said being diagnosed with cancer soon after giving birth and with two small children was 'overwhelming'. \n\n'I quickly learned that taking it one step at a time is the only way to approach it,' she added. \nSince her diagnosis Lindsay said she has become 'more patient and understanding' in her job. \nShe added: 'I've always done my best to try and place myself in my patients shoes- but now that I have first hand experience of what this feels like, I'm hoping I can be an even better resource... \n'I've already noticed my friends at work asking for advice on how to guide a patient through a particular experience.'",

Copy Link \nSpace World, a theme park located in Kitakyushu, Japan, has found itself with some explaining to do after a public outcry over their most recent attempt at wooing visitors. The park created an attraction known as an “ice aquarium” which consisted of 5,000 fish frozen into the water with their bodies spelling out symbols and words such as “hello.” \nWhile the concept is something of a surprise, the public reaction is just what you’d expect. People, both local and distant, are furious. The park’s Facebook page became a depository for angry messages and jokes over the stunt, causing the park to close the exhibit on Sunday. \nHere’s what the scene looked like at the park. It’s as bizarre as you would expect: \nAnd the very images that were used in the promotion of the attraction are now the source of outrage and shock online: \nOne piece of pertinent, yet previously unannounced, information against charges of animal cruelty was released in response to the backlash. The Japan Times ran a statement from Space World which read: \nA spokesperson told the Asahi Shimbun that the park was considering holding a memorial service for the fish next year, adding that the fish were already dead when they were bought from a local wholesaler. \n“Misunderstandings spread on the internet that the fish were frozen while they were still alive, but that was not the case,” the spokesperson told the newspaper. “We should have explained more.” \nYes, they probably should have explained more. And while the fact that the fish were dead might mitigate some outrage, it doesn’t exactly put the stunt in the realm of good taste. If you’re thinking that using a fish for an amusement park novelty is more than a little wasteful, well, the park seems to hear you on that front, too, as the fish, when thawed, will be used as fertilizer.

    "text": "Even though doctors often tell parents that newborns will regain weight lost after birth within a week or two, many infants take much longer to achieve this milestone, a U.S. study suggests.\nNearly all newborns lose weight during the first days after birth, regardless of whether they are breastfed or formula fed. Many doctors expect babies to regain those lost ounces and surpass their birth weight within 10 to 14 days.\nBut by 14 days, 14 per cent of babies born vaginally and 24 per cent of infants delivered via cesarean section surgeries didn't return to their birth weight, the study of almost 144,000 newborns found.\nMore than half of newborns not breastfed in 1st hour, raising health risks, UNICEF says\n\"It is normal for newborns to lose a significant amount of weight in the first 1 to 3 days after delivery due to both urinating excess fluid and limited intake,\" said lead study author Dr. Ian Paul, a researcher at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\nC-section babies may lose more weight after birth because they come into the world more hydrated than other infants due to intravenous fluids given to women prior to and during the surgery, Paul added by email.\n\"Upon birth, the newborn weighs relatively more after a C-section and has therefore more fluid to urinate out resulting in greater relative weight loss,\" Paul said.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that most newborns should surpass their birth weight by the time they are 7 to 10 days old, with weekly gains of 4 to 7 ounces (113 grams to 198 grams) for the first several months of life.\nFor the current study, researchers examined data on babies delivered at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Centers between 2009 and 2013. All of the babies were born at or near full term and had a healthy weight at birth.\nHalf of the newborns were at or above their birth weight at 9 and 10 days after vaginal and cesarean deliveries, respectively, researchers report in Pediatrics .\nAfter 21 days, however, 5 per cent of babies with vaginal births and 8 per cent of infants with cesarean deliveries still weren't back to their birth weights, the study also found.\nOne limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on how infants were fed once they went home from the hospital, which can influence the amount of weight they gain, the authors note.\nEven so, the findings should be reassuring to parents of babies that don't return to their birth weight within 7 to 10 days, said Tessa Crume, a researcher at the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora who wasn't involved in the study.\nIn particular, women who breastfeed should take these results as a reason not to panic, Crume added by email.\n\"For families who want to breastfeed, this is important reassurance that slower regain of infant birth weight does not signal inadequate maternal breast milk supply, but rather a normal newborn growth pattern,\" Crume said.\nTo increase the odds that breastfed babies will gain enough weight, though, women should focus on eating a healthy diet high in fruits, vegetables and healthy fats while they are pregnant and breastfeeding, Crume added by email.\nWomen can also increase their milk production by starting to breastfeed as soon as possible after delivery or by pumping breast milk, said Dr. Sarbattama Sen, a researcher at Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\nWhile parents shouldn't necessarily worry when babies don't regain their birth weight quickly, they should still watch for potential signs of trouble such as dehydration, inactivity, low urine or stool output and jaundice, Sen, who wasn't involved in the study, added by email.\n\"Parents whose infants have not regained birth weight by 7-10 days should continue to be closely monitored by healthcare providers,\" Sen said.\nAs long as babies get these checkups, slow and steady weight gain — even if it's slower than current guidelines suggest — may be just fine, said Dr. Charles Wood of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\"This study will help clinicians and parents reframe expectations around adequate weight gain in early life,\" Wood, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. © Thomson Reuters, 2016",

    "text": "What You Should Know About Catching Walleyes Here’s a Primer on Finding and Catching Walleyes Photo © Ken Schultz By Ken Schultz Updated February 05, 2016 . \nWhen it comes to discussing general fishing techniques for walleyes , here are some key things to remember about this species: walleyes are a schooling species often found in concentrations. they are often not aggressive feeders and therefore can sometimes be challenging to catch. they are susceptible to a wide range of techniques. they have light-sensitive eyes that theoretically make them most active in low-light and dark situations in many environments, but they do feed during daylight hours, and can be caught in the day. they relate to baitfish presence. in certain environments they relate heavily to structure. Bait and Vegetation \nThe primary food for walleyes varies, often being whatever small fish are most prevalent in a given body of water. The activities of the predominant forage have a bearing on where walleyes are: suspended in open water, hugging the bottom along sandbars or reefs or points, waiting along weedlines, etc. The types of structure or objects that they favor include rock reefs, sandbars, gravel bars, points, weeds, rocky or riprap causeways or shorelines, and creek channels. \ncontinue reading below our video The Fastest Miles Ever Run \nWalleyes are particularly known for congregating in or along the edges of vegetation. Walleye weeds, for the most part, are submerged, sometimes slightly visible on or near the surface, especially in shallow water, and often deeper and out of sight. Thick clumps of weeds are preferable to scattered weeds, because the former offer more cover. Clumped weeds is the easiest situation to fish. It may not be available, however, so scattered weeds become the second choice. Shorter weeds in moderately deep water are often preferred by walleyes than taller weeds in the same depth. Knowledgeable walleye anglers always look for the weedline and its depth, using their sonar . An excellent situation to find, though not one as readily fished, is where the weeds are thick and the edge is close to a sharp bottom dropoff. Working the edges of the weeds is particularly effective. Open Water \nIn some places, particularly large lakes, walleyes are also found in deep water, suspended or on the bottom where there are open, basin-like flats. Some walleyes, especially big ones and those that are likely to be feeding, do not hold to the traditional bottom and cover-providing structure, but are in open water to take advantage of migratory schools of baitfish prevalent in those waters, mainly smelt and alewives. So the walleyes relate to the presence of those fish. They may be in a few feet of water or in 20 to 30 feet, over a bottom that is much deeper. Presentations \nFishing presentations for walleyes run a gamut, but largely center on jigging, still-fishing or drifting with live bait, trolling with bait rigs, casting crankbaits, and trolling with plugs. Jigs are mostly used with bait (leeches, minnows, and worms), although hair- and grub-bodied jigs are effective as well. Fixed and slip floats are used for live bait fishing, although sometimes a jig and worm is fished below a float. Trolling rigs include weight-forward or June-bug-style spinners, as well as spinner-and-worm/leech harnesses, and walking or bottom-bouncing sinkers. \nMany walleye anglers have employed a controlled wind drifting and boat movement technique called backtrolling, which essentially is moving transom first, using a tiller-steered outboard motor or a transom-mounted electric motor to keep the boat in proper position. Jigs and rigs are used and almost always fished very slowly. \nWalleye anglers on big waters predominantly employ forward trolling , primarily using shallow to deep-diving plugs (and sometimes spoons), trolling them on flatlines, in-line planers, large sideplaner boards , and even downriggers . Fishing is done at precise depths for suspended and mobile walleyes. Locating the fish, getting to the precise depth, and having good lure action are of paramount importance. Seasonal Info \nWhen walleyes are spawning in rivers, other tributaries, and in shallow bays, fishing, where legal, is relatively easy, but becomes more difficult after spawning when the fish migrate out of rivers and bays into main lake structure and disperse. Through summer, various forms of structure, as well as deep water, are worked. In the fall, walleyes become more concentrated again and are especially found on main lake points that are close to deep water. In large lakes they will migrate toward the upper end where a river comes in, or to a dam end. This is a good time to get bigger fish. \nWalleye fishing is a bit different in rivers. The fish spawn through the same temperature range, and they migrate after spawning, although they may not go very far in smaller systems. In both spring and fall they may be located off the mouths of tributaries; in spring, they are drawn by spawning needs, in fall, by baitfish. They do not suspend, however, and are almost always caught by making bottom-oriented presentations. \nIn large river systems, many walleyes are caught close to dams in winter and spring. At other times, work the deep water off wing dams, island channel cuts, deep-water bridge abutments, and center channel edges. Look for walleyes along a river channel that has considerable depth as well, especially in midsummer. River Specifics \nRiprap is an especially favored walleye haunt in rivers, especially in the evening and if there is deep water nearby. Other prominent locales include cuts, where currents meet each other; eddies and slicks; along and behind islands; large rocks; and the head and tail of pools. River walleyes feed on assorted forage, including crayfish, hellgrammites, and minnows. They are caught by jigging; casting; trolling with spoons, spinners, and plugs; and fishing with live bait. \nJigs are the most effective river walleye lure, probably because they are worked close to the bottom and represent minnows or crayfish. Small and shallow rivers generally require ⅛- to ⅝-ounce jigs; in fast water you should increase weight. Fish jigs with the current; there is no need to actually jig them, and a slow rolling action is best. In spring and fall, use white, yellow, chartreuse, and silver colors; in summer use brown, black, green, or orange-and-brown. \nLive bait is also very effective. A live bait rig having a ¼- to 1-ounce weight, rigged with 20 inches of dropback leader and a No. 2 short-shanked hook, is used. Minnows, nightcrawlers, leeches, salamanders, waterdogs, and crayfish are used for bait, plus assorted minnows. Sinker style can be split shot, egg, or other bottom-bouncing type. Medium Tackle Covers Most Fishing Needs \nTackle needs for walleyes in lakes and rivers are not very complicated. Spinning rods from 5½ to 7 feet long in medium action, and reels filled with 8- to 12-pound line, are standard. Baitcasting tackle can be used as well, generally with slightly heavier strength line. In clear waters , fluorocarbon lines and leaders are desirable, and microfilament lines are a good main line choice. For trolling, especially when planer boards are used, longer rods and stouter gear may be necessary. Flycasting tackle is seldom appropriate, although it is possible to use when the fish are shallow and concentrated. Hardly any fly fishing is done by walleye devotees.",

    "text": "@xan_desanctis \nThis morning, Pope Francis released a document indefinitely extending the power of priests to forgive the sin of abortion. The pope initially granted this power one year ago at the start of the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year of Mercy, which ended yesterday. \nSome outlets have twisted this news to imply that, with Pope Francis’s decision, the sinfulness of abortion has somehow lessened. For example, CNN’s homepage this morning led with the headline “Pope: Abortion is forgivable.” A Rewire piece on the topic claimed that the pope had “downgraded the level of sinfulness of abortion.” Meanwhile, the Independent asserts that “the measure represents a significant softening of the church’s stance on the issue of abortion.” \nIn reality, the Church’s stance on abortion as a moral evil hasn’t changed at all. “I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,” the pope’s letter notes. His decision to extend priests’ ability to forgive abortion doesn’t make it less sinful for a woman to make that choice or for a doctor to perform an abortion. Rather, it clarifies in formal teaching what was already in practice: God’s mercy is such that no sin, no matter how grave, cannot be forgiven. \nContrary to this understanding, the pope’s letter has also led some to believe that, before his decision, having an abortion was an unforgivable sin. In fact, his move was largely symbolic. Prior to the Year of Mercy, abortion was forgivable, but it was necessary for a person receive the sacrament of confession from a bishop rather than a regular priest. This was due to the fact that, under Church teaching, any Catholic who procures an abortion is automatically excommunicated, a penalty that only bishops, cardinals, or the pope himself can lift. \nHowever, bishops are able to delegate this authority to priests, and in some regions such as the U.S. and Britain, priests have already been permitted by bishops to absolve the sin of procuring an abortion. The pope’s decision won’t actually change anything in the way that American Catholics seek and receive forgiveness for abortion-related sins. The Corner",

    "text": "SuperSport face Chiefs acid test 23 November 2016, 12:00 \nKaizer Chiefs will be desperate to bounce back to winning ways when they host SuperSport United in an Absa Premiership encounter at FNB Stadium on Wednesday evening. \nKick-off is at 7.30pm. \nHaving suffered a 2-1 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns over the past weekend, the Amakhosi will be eager to prove their metal against another Tshwane side and Gauteng rival. \nDespite the loss only being their second of the league season and first since the opening day of the campaign when they suffered defeat to Bidvest Wits - losing to two of your main title rivals, having been inferior on both occasions, doesn't bode well for the Soweto giants. \nBut, it is not all doom and gloom for the Glamour Boys who have at times played some good football this season, even if the results have not been forthcoming - especially of late. \nHead coach Steve Komphela has tried to shake things up of late, employing a 3-4-3 system with no fewer than six defensive-minded players included in his starting 11 for the clash against the Brazilians. \nThe formation failed to reap rewards in their defeat to Free State Stars on penalties in the Telkom Knockout Cup, even if the Amakhosi were unlucky to lose, and despite taking the lead against Sundowns - Chiefs were unable to hold on. \nPlaying with two wing-backs and three centre-backs has its advantages, and while many may fear that a change in outlook three months into the season will have a disastrous outcome - the players themselves have come out in defence of the new formation. \n“The system is quite catchy,” said Chiefs defender Daniel Cardoso. “We’ve only just started it now and unfortunately we conceded four goals, but it’s also a lapse of concentration with those silly goals. It’s something we can fix. I think it is a great formation, look at Chelsea. \n“They are playing it and they are playing brilliant football. I think it is something we have to work on and we will come out tops with more practice time. It’s not defensive. We are playing attacking football, maybe people think it’s defensive when the wing-backs track back to help defensively.” \nMidfielder George Maluleka agrees: “It’s not at all defensive,” he added. “If you look at the type of players we have, it accommodates a lot of us. There is nothing wrong with the formation. You saw against Free State Stars and even against Sundowns, our full-backs were in the attacking half, in the final third.\" \nSuperSport, like Chiefs, lost their opening game of the season, but haven't lost since with a 1-1 draw away to Baroka FC extending their unbeaten run in the league to eight matches. \nStuart Baxter has brought about real change at the club with the former Chiefs mentor out to inflict more pain on his former employers. \nThe likes of Kingston Nkhatha, Reneilwe Letsholonyane and Reyaad Pieterse will also be eager to prove their worth against their former side with the latter set to start between the posts. \nHaving played second fiddle to Itumeleng Khune at Chiefs, Pieterse moved to Matsatsantsa ahead of the 2016-17 season with the burly goal-minder set to finally get his chance in midweek following an injury to Ronwen Williams. \n\"Ronwen’s injured and it's quite a bad one and we didn’t get the free-kick by the way when he got a shoulder charge at the back, which is when it got damaged,\" said Baxter. \n\"So we're hoping. He’s going to do the MRI scan and we will see how bad it is but it doesn’t look good at the moment. He’s got nerve reaction going down his legs and that means it’s pretty bad.\" \nIn head-to-head stats, SuperSport and Chiefs have met in 51 league matches since 1990. \nBoth Matsatsantsa and Amakhosi have recorded 19 wins in the rivalry, while 13 matches have been drawn. \nChiefs have won 11 of their 26 home matches against United, suffering 11 defeats in the process. \nLast season the Amakhosi completed a league double over Matsatsantsa, winning 4-1 in Tshwane and 2-1 in the return game at home. \nThe teams have not played to a goalless draw in the league since the first half of the 2007/08 season. © Backpage TXT ",

    "text": "print \nA and N photography/Shutterstock \nIf you're in your early 20s and think you might be part of the growing group of people taking a new interest in marriage, the 37% Rule is for you. \nAccording to journalist Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths, coauthors of \" Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions ,\" that rule could help you save time looking for a spouse. \nThe 37% Rule basically says that when you need to screen a range of options in a limited amount of time — be they candidates for a job, new apartments, or potential romantic partners — the best time to make a decision is when you've looked at 37% of those options. \nAt that point in a selection process, you'll have gathered enough information to make an informed decision, but you won't have wasted too much time looking at more options than necessary. At the 37% mark, you've maximized your chance of selecting the best of the bunch. \nA common thought experiment to demonstrate this theory — developed by non-PC math guys in the 1960s — is called \"The Secretary Problem.\" \nIn the hypothetical, you can only screen secretaries once. If you reject a candidate, you can't go back and hire them later (since they might have accepted another job). The question is: How deep into the pool of applicants do you go to maximize your chance of finding the best one? \nIf you interview just three applicants, the authors explain, your best bet is making a decision based on the strength of the second candidate. If she's better than the first, you hire her. If she's not, you wait. If you have five applicants, you wait until the third to start judging. \nSo if you're looking for love between the ages of 18 and 40, the optimal age to start seriously considering your future husband or wife is just past your 26th birthday (37% into the 22-year span). Before then, you'll probably miss out on higher-quality partners, but after that, good options could start to become unavailable, decreasing your chances of finding \"the one.\" \nIn mathematics lingo, searching for a potential mate is known as an \"optimal stopping problem.\" Over 1,000 possibilities, Christian and Griffiths explain, you should pull the trigger on someone 36.81% of the way through. The bigger the pool of options, the closer to exactly 37% you can get. \nResearch about successful marriages seems to support the age sweet spot of 26. \nLast July, the University of Utah sociologist Nicholas H. Wolfinger discovered that the best ages to get married in order to avoid divorce are between 28 and 32. The range doesn't align exactly — 28 years old is closer to a 45% Rule — but partners usually decide on each other a while before their actual wedding. Wolfinger's analysis also revealed that a couple's chances of breaking up increased by 5% each year after age 32. \nIf you commit to settling down around 26, in other words, you're on the right track. \nThe 37% Rule isn't perfect. Since it borrows from the cold logic of math, it assumes that people have a reasonable understanding of what they want in a partner by 26, but doesn't account for the fact that what we look for in our partners may change dramatically between 18 and 40. \nWhat the 37% Rule does tell us is that 26 is the age when our dating decisions are most trustworthy — it's the point at which we can stop looking and start taking those big leaps of faith.

To show off just how powerful (pun intended) their solar technology is, the company is wiring the entire island of Ta'u in American Samoa, having installed a microgrid of solar energy panels and batteries over the past year. \nThese solar energy panels and batteries will supply close to 100 percent of the power needed by Ta'u's modest population of 600 people. \nThis microgrid will be able to power the entire island for three days without any sunlight, and has the capacity to recharge back to 100% within seven hours. The intention behind this project, of course, falls in line with the rest of Elon Musk's grandeur vision: to help lesson the carbon footprint of the world. \nThe project itself was funded by American Samoan and US authorities. Tesla has stated that the microgrid will offset the island's previous use of 109,500 gallons of diesel per year , along with the import shipping costs to get that fuel there in the first place. \nThis is a prime example of what sort of potential benefits may unfold from the Solarcity acquisition, however a long road remains ahead before the company is fully profitable.

    "text": "President Obama is heading into his administration's final weeks with a full agenda of new draft orders to consider, even though his successor has vowed to scale back job-killing regulation and cancel \"all illegal and overreaching executive orders.\"\nDespite the likelihood that US President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress would kill any controversial late-in-the-game moves by Mr. Obama, federal agencies under the Democratic president are pushing for a flurry of so-called \"midnight\" regulations on everything from the environment to transportation and financial marketplaces.\nThe White House was reviewing as many as 98 final regulations , as of Nov. 15, that could be implemented before Mr. Trump takes office, including 17 with an estimated annual economic impact of $100 million or more, Politico reported. But lawmakers have warned agency heads to avoid rushing to finalize rules or regulations before Obama leaves office.\nRecommended: Presidents and the economy: Who was best, worst? Take our quiz. \"Should you ignore this counsel, please be aware that we will work with our colleagues to ensure that Congress scrutinizes your actions – and, if appropriate, overturns them ,\" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R) of California, wrote in a letter last week.\nTest your knowledge Presidents and the economy: Who was best, worst? Take our quiz. Several of the new rules slated for installation before Trump assumes office include environmental protections that critics argue hamper business interests and economic potential. Although some offices had initially delayed implementation of their rules, expecting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to win on Election Day, the offices have pivoted to promulgate the rules quickly after Trump's unexpected win – and faced criticism.\n\"We're looking at the stack of regulations and the fact that the agencies are just as ill-prepared to make these new regulations work as we are confused on how we can possibly comply in such a short time ,\" Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government and public affairs at the Western Energy Alliance in Denver, told The Hill.\nOthers, however, contend that the push for environmental protections is consistent.\n\"We've seen a whole trajectory here of the Obama administration leaning into conservation and climate issues,\" Alex Taurel, the League of Conservation Voters deputy legislative director, told The Hill.\nUS Interior Department spokeswoman Jessica Kershaw said in an email that the administration is merely \"finishing the business we started and in some cases, finishing the business of prior administrations where decisions weren't complete when we took the helm.\"\nWith the addition of three monuments in February, Obama had designated more than 265 million acres of land and water – more than any other president since the US Antiquities Act afforded his office the power in 1906 to protect public lands – as The Christian Science Monitor reported:\nTo some, Mr. Obama's use of the 110-year-old Antiquities Act to unilaterally designate a massive area that holds everything from lava flows to Joshua trees is a major legacy move, part of the President’s \"commitment to aggressive action\" to preserve public lands in their natural state.\nBut to others, it smacks of federal overreach .\nRepublicans who hope to undo segments of Obama's legacy have a powerful tool to do so in the Congressional Review Act of 1996. The law will enable Congress in January to repeal, with a simple-majority vote, any agency rule completed after May 30, 2016, as Politico reported. After blocking any rule with that mechanism, the agency would be barred from enacting anything that is \"substantially the same.\"\nAnd some Republicans are pushing to bolster the tool by enabling Congress to repeal groups of regulation wholesale, instead of dismantling it piece by piece.",

(Credit: AP) \nA lot of powerful people in Donald Trump’s inner circle don’t want Mitt Romney to be the president-elect’s secretary of state. \nAlthough Trump has apparently told aides that Romney “looks the part” and would do a fine job in the role, many in the Republican establishment are dismayed with Romney’s harsh denunciations of Trump, and wish he would appoint someone more genuinely loyal. This includes Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state https://t.co/HDtpjeJTc3 \n— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 \nAccording to a report from The New York Times on Thursday, Trump’s chief strategist Stephen Bannon is also opposed to Romney’s selection because of the latter’s characterization of Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud” and are concerned that Romney would turn the State Department into a rogue agency. \nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich made his thoughts on Romney known during an interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson on Tuesday. After pointing out that Romney had once wanted to be president himself, he asked “to what degree would Romney, once he became secretary of state, represent himself?” In addition, Gingrich questioned “to what extent would he actually represent the kind of tough-minded ‘America first’ policies that Trump has campaigned on?” . @edhenry ‘s sources say Gov Mitt Romney may issue an apology to the President-elect to secure the Secretary of State position. Will it work? pic.twitter.com/ik9mNdUJxw \n— FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) November 25, 2016 \nSimilarly, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee questioned whether Romney is worthy of representing President-elect Trump in other countries given his earlier harsh rhetoric. \n“It would be a real insult to all those Donald Trump voters who worked really hard,” Huckabee explained on “Fox and Friends” on Wednesday. “When you go after a person who is the nominee of your party, who has been duly nominated by the voters . . . you’re savaging the voters. You’re not just savaging Donald Trump.” \nThe New York Times also pointed out that Conway defended her tweet by pointing out that the grass-roots supporters for Trump seem most outraged “not against something he said, but something he may do.” She also wrote that being “loyal” was the most important quality for a secretary of state. Fox News host Sean Hannity, who was one of Trump’s most loyal supporters during the presidential campaign, has been similarly distrusting toward Romney. “Mitt Romney reportedly is being considered for secretary of state?,” Hannity asked last Thursday. “Look, I think Mitt Romney would have been a great president but the way he acted here? No loyalty. He should not be under consideration, in my view. Your thoughts.” Romney’s potential appointment could even alienate Trump from the regime of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin , whom he had previously considered to be one of his closest possible allies. The Russian publication Obozrevatel announced the possible pick with the headline “Secretary of State Russophobe,” while the state-owned channel NTV insisted that “in America and beyond its borders, Romney is called one of the biggest Russophobes.” Matthew Rozsa is a Ph.D. student in history at Lehigh University and a political columnist.

    "text": "Hamilton’ s Brandon Victor Dixon Says “There’s Nothing to Apologize For.” by Charline Jao | 3:23   \nThe cast of Hamilton delivered a message to VP-elect Mike Pence over the weekend, telling him they hope the show will encourage him to fight for the rights of all Americans. Pence commented saying he didn’t take offense at the message, but Trump fired off a series of tweets demanding an apology from the cast. Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor who portrays Aaron Burr and who read the message, refused to talk less and smile more in a CBS appearance where he addressed some of the backlash. \nIn response to a comment saying that they could have spoke to him backstage, the actor responds that Pence should have had the option to come backstage, and encourages the soon-to-be VP to have a conversation with them there. To answer why he was the one to read the message, Dixon explains that it was a request from producer Jeffrey Seller and that he was happy to do it, and even felt honored to do so. \nFor me, I think the most important thing with respect to all of the emotions that everyone’s feeling after this election is to make sure people recognize that we are not alone. We are here together and we need to listen to one another and speak with one another and those of us who feel like maybe their voice has been marginalized or might become marginalized–it’s important to recognize that there are allies all over the place. \nDixon also reveals in the interview that Seller, director Thomas Kail, and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda were all involved in crafting the message. The message was then read in front of the cast, who made additional adjustments before it was presented for Pence. \nTo the demand of an apology, Dixon simply takes a sip from his cup and says, “There’s nothing to apologize for.” When asked whether he was worried this would set off other theater disruptions in the face of a recent audience interruption in Chicago (a man acted with extreme hostility and said things like “We won. Trump is President. Get over it”), the actor dismissed this concern. \nWhen you have a platform, art is meant to bring people together. It’s meant to raise consciousness. And when you have a platform like that–I told Jeffrey Sellers after that, “I applaud you all for not throwing away your shot. For taking a moment to spread a message of love. To spread a message of unity.” We’re not here to boo. We’re here to cheer each other on.” \nA point that wasn’t brought up in the interview were the various voices that called the incident a “distraction” from other news stories. It’s understandable that while we’re trying to balance the many horrendous, appalling, and urgent stories concerning Trump’s upcoming administrations (like the $25 million Trump University settlement ), many will feel frustrated that the majority of public attention is towards a specific story that feels like “fluff.” However, I think it’s important not to write off the words of artists of color in a production as important and popular as Hamilton. Like Dixon says, that platform is powerful, and we should be paying attention to how they’re using it to facilitate conversation and change. There’s room for both of those stories, and as we get closer to inauguration, I imagine we’ll have to learn how to balance them even more. \nDixon voices everything that theatre should strive for and even extends an offer that mirrors the Trump seat George Takei saved at Allegiance. “We welcome Donald Trump here at Hamilton, ” the actor says, “I think the power of the show and the way we tell it is undeniable. I think it’s important for everyone to see a show like ours.” \n(via Variety , Featured Image via CBS) \n ",

Those photographs will be shared online to thousands of people. Those few hours will be the embodiment of how thousands of people recognize them.

Sure, it can be fun to add some extra confidence to my walk when I’m dressed as EDI, but I hardly go around saluting strangers in my Captain America outfit.” “At the end of the day, most of us are just regular people trying to hang out with other people while showing off the hard work and craftsmanship we’re capable of.”",

Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP Trump faces hurdles to reinstating waterboarding 1  /  4 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump backs waterboarding and his pick for CIA director has called those who have done it \"patriots\" not \"torturers.\" Yet a Trump administration faces steep legal and legislative hurdles to reinstate the interrogation practice that simulates drowning.\nUnder a law approved last year, all government employees, including intelligence agents, must abide by Army guidelines for interrogating prisoners — guidelines that don't permit waterboarding. Those rules are subject to review, but it's not clear if they can be revised to allow the practice.\nIf the Trump administration were to try to change the law or the guidelines, the effort would run into bipartisan opposition in Congress. The most formidable obstacle there would be a fellow Republican, John McCain . The Arizona senator, who was beaten as a prisoner of war in Vietnam in the 1960s, adamantly opposes waterboarding. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , he would be well-positioned to block any attempt to revive it.\nMcCain has clashed before with Trump, who during the campaign claimed the former Navy pilot wasn't a war hero because he had been captured. At a security conference in Canada last weekend, McCain indicated he was ready to take on Trump again as begins another six-year term after winning re-election.\n\"I don't give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do,\" McCain said. \"We will not waterboard. We will not do it.\"\nWaterboarding and other harsh methods were used in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to try to obtain useful information from terrorist suspects. Many intelligence, military and law enforcement officials say the practice is ineffective as well as immoral. They say it breaks down trust between the suspect and interrogators and often prompts a detainee to say anything to stop the harsh treatment.\nBut Trump, who revved up his supporters with tough talk against against Islamic State extremists, pledged to interrogate terrorist suspects with waterboarding and a \"hell of a lot worse.\"\n\"Don't tell me it doesn't work,\" Trump said. \"Torture works, OK folks?\"\nTrump's nominee for CIA is Rep. Mike Pompeo , a conservative congressman from Kansas who has criticized President Barack Obama for \"ending our interrogation program,\" which Obama did not do. Pompeo criticized the release of the Senate's 2014 report on harsh interrogation of detainees and argued that the CIA program operated within the law.\n\"Our men and women who were tasked to keep us safe in the aftermath of 9/11 — our military and our intelligence warriors — are ... not torturers, they are patriots,\" Pompeo said then.\nThe views of Trump's other nominees are more opaque.\nTrump's national security adviser, Retired Army Lt. General Michael Flynn , has not ruled out the use of waterboarding. \"If the nation was in grave danger from a terrorist attack involving weapons of mass destruction, and we had certain individuals in our custody with information that might avoid it, then I would probably OK enhanced interrogation techniques within certain limits,\" he told Politico in October.\nTrump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Ala., was one of a few senators who voted against bipartisan anti-torture provisions in 2005 and 2015. But in 2008, Sessions said: \"I am glad we are no longer utilizing waterboarding. I hope we never have to do it again.\" That was before the rise of IS militants.\nAnd on Tuesday, Trump told The New York Times that he asked retired Marine Gen. James Mattis , a strong prospect for defense secretary, about waterboarding and was surprised to hear Mattis does not favor it.\nWaterboarding has been prohibited since 2009. Two days after taking office, Obama issued an executive order prohibiting all government employees from using any interrogation method that wasn't spelled out in the Army Field Manual, a military how-to guide.\nWanting to ensure that no future president could tear up the order, McCain teamed up with Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif., to turn it into law. Their anti-torture amendment was adopted in a 78-21 bipartisan vote and became law late last year.\nThe law requires the Army to conduct a review of the field manual every three years in consultation with the attorney general, the FBI director and the director of national intelligence. The first review deadline is Dec. 19, 2017, during Trump's first year in office.\nIt's not clear if the review could result in changes allowing waterboarding or other harsh interrogation methods.\nThe best interrogation methods build rapport with suspects, according to the High-Value Detainee Group , a team of the nation's top interrogators who deploy to question detainees around the world. The group recently issued a report on the best interrogation practices, based on the latest behavioral and social science research.\nHuman rights advocates have long fought against any resumption of harsh interrogation techniques. They say the intelligence community stands firmly against it and point to a comment made this year by former CIA Director Michael Hayden . He said: \"If any future president wants (the) CIA to waterboard anybody, he better bring his own bucket, because CIA officers aren't going to do it.\"",

(Photo: Tony Ding/Associated Press) \nBack at Pickerington (Ohio) North high school, it seemed remote. \nBut on Saturday, it will be reality: Michigan All-America tight end Jake Butt and Ohio State All-America offensive lineman Pat Elflein, high school teammates, will meet before The Game. \n“I told him back in January when he got elected captain, I congratulated him,” Butt said this week. “We were both two-time captains for North in high school. I was like, ‘How cool would that be if we met at the 50-yard line before The Game (as captains)?’ And sure enough, that’s going to happen this week.” \nThe friendship that goes back to high school in Pickerington, a Columbus suburb, transcends Saturday’s battle between No. 2 Ohio State and No. 4 Michigan. \n► Related : BTN remembers 2006 Michigan-Ohio State game \n“We keep in touch,” Butt said. “When I say Pat’s a good friend of mine, I mean that. We stay in touch in season, out of season. I don’t really get to go home during the season so we don’t really get to see each other, but we stay in touch. We both care about each other.” \nYet this is a week that divides friends, especially those battling for the same goal. The winner has a good shot at reaching the College Football Playoff. \nElflein already has a national title from 2014, but that only means he wants another one. \nWhile the Buckeyes were soaring that year, Butt was returning from an ACL tear early and enduring a collapse and coach firing later in the season. \nMichigan defensive end Taco Charlton (Photo: Julia Nagy LSJ) \nFor them to meet with everything on the line two years later seemed improbable then. Now, it’s too real. \nThey’re the most visible representatives of their town, Pickerington, which has four players in this game, two on each side. Elflein is joined by Pickerington Central redshirt freshman defensive tackle Davon Hamilton and Butt has senior defensive end Taco Charlton. \nButt and Charlton both enrolled early their freshman year and lived together for a few years, making a few of the 31/2-hour drives back home together. \n“We still knew each other and once we both committed we started to talk more than we did before,” Charlton said. “Once we got here we were as close as can be. That’s my brother right there. We’re super close.” \n► Related : Michigan vs. Ohio State 2006: An oral history \nFor the city of Pickerington to produce three starters in this game, all who should be upper-round NFL draft picks, is unusual. \n“My class, the class above us, the class below us, we’ve got a lot of really good athletes and I think it helped growing up that we had a lot of talent so we could push each other,” said Butt, who never got serious interest from the Buckeyes in recruiting. “I guess that all played a factor in how we got to this level.” \nCharlton’s family will have divided loyalties. \n“It’s different — growing up 10-15 minutes from the stadium, actually being born at Ohio State University hospital — it’s different for my family, some of whom are Ohio State fans, they just cheer for me,” Charlton said. “It’s a weird week for them. But you’ve still got my mom, dad and little sister who are still die-hard Michigan fans now. So they definitely support me. It’ll be fun to play in my home city.” \nButt, Charlton and Elflein have brought Pickerington back to the forefront, a town physically close to one campus but on Saturday trapped between the two. \nIt’ll start at the 50-yard line for everyone, with two Pickerington kids shaking hands. \n“That will be cool for us,” Elflein told reporters in Columbus this week. “It will be cool for Pickerington, back home. And our families and friends that we grew up with. \n“It’s going to be cool to see two guys out of the same town, to make it and be captains of their teams, especially in a rivalry like this. It will be cool to represent Pickerington.” \nJeff Seidel contributed. Contact Mark Snyder at . Follow him on Twitter at @mark__snyder.

    "text": "Fracking report says no to controversial process without community consent Updated November 29, 2016 18:04:27 Map: Mount Gambier 5290 \nUnconventional gas exploration or production should not go ahead in South Australia's south-east without a social licence, the Natural Resources Committee has recommended. \nThe committee, which has spent two years looking into the industry and the process of hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\", tabled its report in State Parliament. \nIt also found that while the specific process of fracking was unlikely to pose significant risks to groundwater when properly managed, other processes associated with unconventional gas extraction, including mid to long-term well integrity and surface spills, presented risks that need to be considered. \nPresiding member Steph Key said the committee had determined a social licence does not yet exist for the development of an unconventional gas industry in the state's south-east. \n\"This has been made starkly apparent by widespread opposition from the local community and it is the overarching finding of the inquiry,\" Ms Key said. Committee's recommendations: Without social licence, unconventional gas exploration should not proceed Processes associated with unconventional gas exploration must be properly considered and managed A review of the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000 would be appropriate Potential for disruption to land and local communities should be addressed in agreements A definitive proposal for unconventional gas development should be produced before any further consideration can be given to potential economic benefits \n\"This is not to say unconventional gas exploration and development should never occur in the region, but that in the committee's view, obtaining social licence is a necessary precondition to such development occurring.\" \nIn the report, the committee said it received vivid evidence of a communication gap between the industry's proponents and the Limestone Coast community. \nOverall, 178 written submissions were received and 66 witnesses presented evidence, including residents and businesspeople from the south-east, along with local government representatives. \n\"Throughout the inquiry, all evidence the committee heard, both for and against unconventional gas development, has been in the context of myriad external forces including climate change considerations, production and export price, export demand, technological advances, renewable energy growth and very notably, public opinion,\" Ms Key said. Opposition proposes 10-year ban \nOpposition Leader Steven Marshall said he supported the report's findings, and wanted to prevent fracking in south-east SA. \n\"I announce today that if we're elected in March 2018 we'll put a 10 year moratorium on fracking in the south-east,\" Mr Marshall said. \n\"This is a vitally important very productive part of our state. At the moment the confidence of the primary producers in that area has been undermined by the threat of fracking in the south-east.\" \nBut Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis said a moratorium would put a stranglehold on economic development. \n\"He's [Mr Marshall] opposed to building infrastructure. He's opposed to a new hospital. Now he's opposed to the oil and gas sector and a referendum on nuclear industries,\" Mr Koutsantonis said. \n\"This man is trying to stifle SA and build on their fears rather than build up their hopes.\"",

    "text": "This article was originally published on The Conversation . Read the original article . \nPolls indicate that one demographic slice instrumental in electing Donald Trump was white women . Indeed, 53 percent of white women cast their votes in his direction . \nThere’s current debate on why this might be – blatant or veiled racism, admiration for Trump’s business prowess or supporting someone who’s fired up to protect us from terrorism and radical Islam. But one unrecognized and insidious force – one that some women will likely minimize or deny – is internalized gynophobia . \nMany people are familiar with the term homophobia – dislike of or prejudice against people who are homosexual. Some of us may even know the phrase “internalized homophobia” – when lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender and queer people take on society’s negative perceptions about them, leading to devaluation and poor regard for themselves. \nAs a clinical psychologist, I avoid engaging in armchair analysis. But watching this election, and the strong resistance to a female candidate, I’ve found myself wondering if the women who vehemently oppose Hillary Clinton suffer some kind of version of related self-loathing. And, I worry about the consequences for women’s health. \nIt’s curious to me that women were so opposed to a female candidate and unwilling to excuse her flaws – but that they overlooked the flaws of a male candidate who had made many disparaging words against women. \nWe do know that harmful words, attitudes and actions harm women’s health. The effects of rape, discrimination and harassment are long-lasting, affecting the personal and professional lives of women for decades. \nThe health effects of sexual assault for women across their lifespan are potentially enormous. For example, even after controlling for other childhood adversities, childhood sexual abuse was associated with the subsequent onset of 14 mood, anxiety and substance use disorders among women – depression, dysthymia, mania, agoraphobia, panic attack, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, alcohol problems, alcohol dependence, drug problems, drug dependence and severe drug dependence. Soak that in for a minute. \nThe frequency and intensity of sexual harassment are also related to physical and mental health problems for women, as well as difficulties in work and interpersonal activities . \nWas it hate speech? \nIf you’re a woman and you cast your ballot for Trump, I’m not looking to judge you. You are my family members and my friends. And I care about you deeply. \nI’m asking you to quietly consider how you feel about your own power – where you feel it comes from (your role as mother, daughter, spouse, worker) and how comfortable you are with sources of your power that are not defined by traditional nurturing roles. I’m also asking you to respectfully join me in thinking through this potential issue, as I believe it holds us and our country back. \nThis is important because of the potential health as well as social effects. Already, millions of women have felt at least temporarily depressed by the election of a man who they believe values women only if they look a certain way – tall, young, long-legged and big-breasted. He has repeatedly graded women on the “1-10” scale, saying that a woman with small breasts would have a hard time being rated “a 10.” In addition, he reportedly told talk show host Howard Stern that it was OK to call his daughter “a piece of ass.” Had he been speaking of another group of people, it might have been viewed as “hate speech.” \nRecently, three middle-aged white women friends from college called me up, out of the blue. They had gotten together for a girls’ weekend and wanted to say “hi.” I was delighted to hear from them. We hadn’t spoken in almost 15 years. \nAs the conversation went on, their negative opinions on Hillary came out from, “being a bad role model for our children by staying in a relationship with her husband after he cheated on her” to “not caring about the American people.” Stupefied, I began asking them questions to understand their thinking. \nI’m not saying that women ought to always like or support one another. But the vehemence which is projected onto the screen of Hillary is disconcerting and needs examination. The calls of “lock her up” did not come from men only. This leads me to wonder about the role of self-loathing. Woman holding a ‘lock her up’ sign. Evan Vucci/AP \nWomen voting for Trump may say something about how women feel about their own power as well as who has the power to govern. Political scientists have proved women’s overwhelming effectiveness in federal and state government. Thus, based on their effectiveness in office, one might think that the bias would be reversed, unless there’s something very deep going on inside. \nWith internalized gynophobia, there seems to be disproportionate dependence – believing that only men can take care of us, disempowerment without the protection and support of a man, severe self-limits in asking for our needs to be meet at home and on the job, and woman-bashing. \nOf course this is a simplification. And not every stress or intensity of being LGBTQ can be equated with being women. Women in the U.S. don’t typically experience fear of being disowned because of their gender, and we don’t typically face overt disapproval within our religious communities. \nWe also don’t have to come out or fear getting “outed.” Our family, friends, workplace, world and religion can tell we’re women by looking at us. But we do share some historical and contemporary parallel experiences with the LGBTQ population in terms of oppression – fear of discrimination or violence and societal judgment and disapproval. \nThe impact of internalized homophobia on psychological distress has been fairly well-documented. Fear and loathing of self negatively influences the mental health of the LGBTQ population. Gay men reporting higher levels of internalized homophobia are less likely to have come out of the closet and thus be their authentic selves. I wonder if the same could be true for women who experience internalized gynophobia. \nSimilar to sexually diverse populations, women are at an increased risk for mental health concerns . And there have been studies on women’s self-loathing and its relationship to acceptance of their bodies as well as eating patterns . \nA roster of contributing factors \nThere’s probably a host of conscious and unconscious reasons contributing to internalized gynophobia. Maybe personality traits like deference. Or maybe it’s coming from women from traditional backgrounds, who are taught through upbringing or socialization processes to be a dutiful and good girl. \n\nIt may also come from women who have learned to value themselves by their attractiveness and see their power solely or primarily through the seduction of and protection by men. \nWhatever the cause, the world could benefit from healthily addressing issues such as internalized gynophobia, expected rejection, stereotyping and oppression. Discrimination and sexual harassment at work go beyond even mental and physical health. Sexual harassment is a significant public health problem that also affects work-related satisfaction and functioning. \nOne potential mechanism to support sexual minorities’ resilience is the development of growth-fostering relationships – authentic and mutual connections with close LGBTQ friends. Others might be to acknowledge the gynophobia or sexism implicit in our world and work to counter the internalized gynophobia that may occur in us or others. \nAgain, I’m not saying that every woman should have been “with Her.” And let me be clear, this is not just about our feelings toward Hillary. Other powerful women in business or leadership has felt the deep cuts of rejection before – Martha Stewart, Carly Fiorina, Meg Whitman, Marisa Meyer, to name a few. \nBut in this post-election, it would be helpful and healing and maybe even protective for all of us to understand that Hillary’s femaleness was not the deal-breaker. And I offer my hand in community to all willing to explore this perspective further.",

LeBoeuf \nLiquids shared mouth-to-mouth by social insects contain proteins and small molecules that can influence the development and organisation of their colonies, according to new findings published in eLife . \nThe study from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, suggests Florida carpenter ants can collectively influence their communities by shifting the cocktail of proteins, hormones and other small molecules that they pass mouth-to-mouth to one another and their young through a process called trophallaxis. \n\"Food is passed to every adult and developing ant by trophallaxis. This creates a network of interactions linking every member of the colony,\" says senior author Laurent Keller, Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution. \n\"A lot of researchers consider trophallaxis only as a means of food-sharing,\" adds Professor Richard Benton of the Center for Integrative Genomics, also a senior author of the study. \"But trophallaxis occurs in other contexts, such as when an ant is reunited with a nest-mate after isolation. We therefore wanted to see if the fluid exchanged by trophallaxis contains molecules that allow ants to pass other chemical messages to each other, and not just food.\" \nTo answer this question, the team, led by first author and postdoctoral researcher Dr Adria LeBoeuf, analysed fluid from pairs of ants engaged in trophallaxis. Surprisingly, they identified a large number of proteins that appear to be involved in regulating the growth of ants, along with high levels of juvenile hormone , an important regulator of insect development, reproduction, and behaviour. Carpenter ants ( Camponotus floridanus ) are exchanging fluid mouth-to-mouth by trophallaxis. Credit: Adria C. LeBoeuf \nTo see what effect this hormone has on the growth of larvae fed by trophallaxis, the scientists added it to the food of larvae-rearing ants and discovered that the hormone made it twice as likely that the larvae would survive to reach adulthood. \n\"This indicates that juvenile hormone and other molecules transferred mouth-to-mouth over this social network could be used by the ants to collectively decide how their colony develops,\" says LeBoeuf. \"So, when the ants feed their larvae, they aren't just feeding them food, they are casting quantitative ballots for their colony, administering different amounts of growth-promoting components to influence the next generation. \n\"The effects of juvenile hormone that we see are consistent with previous studies in other ants and in bees where larvae treated with an analogue of this hormone tend to develop into larger workers and even queens.\" \nAlong with growth proteins and juvenile hormone, the team also identified small molecules and chemical signals in the carpenter ants' trophallactic liquid that help them recognize their nest-mates. They demonstrated for the first time the presence of chemical cues in the fluid that are known to be important in providing ants with a colony-specific odour that allows them to distinguish family from non-family members. \n\"Overall, we show that liquid transmitted among ants contains much more than food and digestive enzymes,\" adds LeBoeuf. \"Our findings suggest that trophallaxis underlies a private communication channel that ants use to direct the development of their young, similar to milk in mammals.\" \n\"More generally, this opens the possibility that the oral exchange of fluids, such as saliva, in other animals might also serve previously unsuspected roles.\"",

    "text": "FYI, Almonds Are Not Nuts. And Neither Are A Lot Of Other 'Nuts.' Everything we know is a lie. 11/28/2016 11:09 am ET \nWe all know almonds are a healthy snack and a great dessert ingredient . \nBut get this: almonds are not nuts. They’re seeds of a fruit. \nMore specifically, they’re seeds of the almond fruit , which grows on a tree and is very similar to a peach, botanically speaking. When the almond fruit is ripe, we remove its flesh and shell, then eat the small kernel inside. Check it out: Flowerphotos via Getty Images Unripe almond fruit hangs on a tree. Bloomberg via Getty Images A farmer cuts open the fruit's fuzzy hull to reveal the seed inside. ullstein bild via Getty Images When the almonds are ripe, their hulls split open. Andia via Getty Images The hulls get dry and curled , exposing the inner almond pit. GomezDavid via Getty Images See that pit in there? The seed we eat is just underneath it. Here’s why almonds are not nuts. \nIn the botanical world, a nut is a dry, hard-shelled fruit . But as you can see, almonds have a fleshy outer layer. Therefore they’re technically not nuts, but a different kind of fruit called a drupe , said Tom Gradziel , an almond researcher at the University of California, Davis. \nYou could compare them to another drupe you know well. \n“Almonds are basically peaches,” Gradziel told HuffPost. “But instead of the fruity part becoming fleshy, most of it sizes up in the kernel.” \nAlmonds are indeed a member of the prunus family that includes peaches, though not the same species. The plants are incredibly similar . Both Gradziel and Richard Rosecrance , a fruit tree researcher at California State University, Chico, told of farmers in Asia who breed peach-like fruits for their large, edible kernels, which can be removed from the pit and snacked on like almonds. \nIn the U.S., farmers mix almonds’ outer flesh into feed for dairy cows , Gradziel said. A lot of other nuts aren’t “nuts,” either. \nMany of the other foods we call “nuts” aren’t actually nuts , either. Similar to almonds, walnuts and pistachios are are not nuts because they grow fleshy, leathery exteriors instead of hard shells, Gradziel says. \nSee? Tim Graham via Getty Images A walnut tree. ATTA KENARE via Getty Images A pistachio tree. \nThere are other factors that determine true nuts from non-nuts, but looking at their shell (or lack thereof) is one obvious way botanists tell the difference. Gradziel confirmed that cashews and pecans aren’t nuts, either. \nAn acorn , on the other hand, is a prime example of a true nut because it has a hard outer shell. However, you’re still allowed to call them “nuts.” \nThe culinary use of the word “nut” is much broader and looser in definition, so you can use it as you always have and fare just fine around cooks or fellow snackers. A scientist, however, may want to debate the issue. And allergies are a nutty case, too. \nWe also use a loose definition of “nut” when talking about allergies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration groups almonds with walnuts and pecans in a broader “tree nut” category. \nYou can be allergic to just one “tree nut,” but some groups of nuts tend to cause allergy symptoms together , said Dr. James Baker , chief medical officer of the the patient advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education. People who are allergic to walnuts also tend to get irritated by pecans, he says. If you’re allergic to almonds, it’s more likely you’re allergic to cashews, Brazil nuts and pistachios. Hazelnuts fall into both groups. \nThis, Baker says, is because many “nuts” have similar allergy-causing proteins with a particular tendency to bring on symptoms. If you have allergy symptoms after eating nuts ― either true nuts or what we merely call nuts ― Baker recommends visiting an allergist. \nIf not, snack on.",

Barrett.\n“That wasn’t a first down,” Harbaugh said flatly (read more of Harbaugh’s comments here ).\nFrom the Big Ten’s news release:\nThe Big Ten determined that Harbaugh’s postgame comments regarding officials were in violation of Big Ten Conference Agreement 10.01, which states in part that “The Big Ten Conference expects all contests involving a member institution to be conducted without compromise to any fundamental element of sportsmanship. Such fundamental elements include integrity of competition, civility toward all, and respect, particularly toward opponents and officials.”\nCoaches are teachers as well, and there is an expectation that they set the example for students and others in the area of sportsmanship.\nIn addition to the controversial spot that awarded Barrett a first down (preceding Curtis Samuel’s game-winning touchdown run), Harbaugh was upset about a pass interference call on Ohio State’s game-tying fourth quarter drive. The coach was also flagged 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh wasn’t too happy with the officiating in the Wolverines’ loss to Ohio State.

    "text": "WATCH: Aqib Talib Shoves Jordan Norwood After Muffed Punt Against Chiefs Chad Jensen 2:41 PM / Originally published on Mile High Huddle Aqib Talib was fired up after Jordan Norwood muffed a punt early in the fourth quarter of Denver's 30-27 overtime loss to Kansas City. \nThe way the Denver Broncos play football — keeping their cards close to the vest — their margin for error is slim. They can ill-afford mental errors, coverage breakdowns or costly turnovers, especially late in a single-score game. \nField position becomes a penultimate key. \nhttp://www.scout.com/story/1731476-scout-s-cyber-monday-sale-is-on?s=101 Unfortunately, a multitude of errors was how the cookie crumbled for the Broncos on Sunday night vs. the Kansas City Chiefs . There were several Denver breakdowns — a safety and free kick returned for a touchdown among them. \nOne of the toughest pills to swallow was Jordan Norwood 's muffed punt early in the fourth quarter, which was recovered by the Chiefs. The Broncos were trailing the Chiefs by six points and the defense had just forced Alex Smith off the field on a three-and-out. \nKansas City punter Dustin Colquitt was forced to punt from his own endzone. Had Norwood simply secured the catch, it would have given Trevor Siemian and company excellent field position, inside Kansas City territory. \nInstead, the Broncos defense, which had been battling for three hard-fought quarters, were forced to trot back out onto the field. As Norwood was exiting the field, cornerback Aqib Talib and the defense were taking it. Talib could be seen shoving Norwood from behind, with some choice words. \nhttps://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/803087052120072193 \nThe Broncos defense forced Kansas City to punt again on the ensuing possession, but it flipped field position, pinning Siemian and the offense back on their own 12-yard line. The Chiefs didn't get any points out of it, but it was a mental error in a high-stakes Divisional bout. \nTalib was justifiably fired up, but every NFL player screws up once in a while. Norwood was already kicking himself, and likely didn't need one of his teammates to add insult to injury. \nPerhaps Talib's frustration is symptomatic of a reported \"rift\" that's taking place inside the Broncos locker room, between the defense and the offense. The defense has carried this team for most of the season, and it's apparently wearing thin on them. \nNorwood's muffed punt was technically a special teams gaffe, but nevertheless, Talib and the defense were frustrated. It's one thing to be emotional. But the concern is that where there's smoke, there's fire. \nHead Coach Gary Kubiak commented on the Talib-Norwood incident via the Denver Post. \n“Let me just say this: We compete at the highest level, and our guys compete all the time — practice, game, those type of things,” Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Monday . “I see guys competing, guys are upset. Jordan and Aqib are fine, I can tell you that. That’s not an issue. Obviously emotions get in the way and those are things we got to talk about and stuff and control our emotions. But it’s a very competitive environment down there and there was no harm intended, I can tell you that. Those guys are fine and we’ll continue to compete.” \nIt was a very tough loss and one that the Broncos can only hope to learn from. However, if there truly is a rift growing inside the locker room, that does not portend well for a strong, unified Broncos team heading down the stretch. \nChad Jensen is the Publisher of Mile High Huddle.

    "text": "Julian Draxler may be granted a move away from Wolfsburg at the end of the season, according to the club's director of sport Klaus Allofs.\nThe Germany international hit out at the Bundesliga outfit after he was denied a transfer last summer despite publicly stating his desire to leave.\nBut with Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain among those interested in Draxler, Allofs admits that Wolfsburg could choose to cash-in on their star man.\nJulian Draxler (left) could be allowed to leave Wolfsburg at the end of the current season\nDraxler tries to avoid a challenge from Italy's Luca Antonelli during a recent international\nDRAXLER THIS SEASON Appearances: 8\nGoals: 0\nAssists: 0\nChances created: 14\nPass accuracy: 82 per cent\nBundesliga statistics only \n'We'll evaluate the situation differently, and we may do things differently next time,' Allofs told German TV channel Sport1. \n'Does this mean letting him [Draxler] leave? Potentially.' \nDraxler and Wolfsburg have struggled for form this season, with the club sitting in a disappointing 14th place in the table. \nHowever, Allofs believes the ex-Schalke winger is determined to help the club get back on track, making a move in the January transfer window unlikely. \n'This story doesn't help him, or Wolfsburg,' Allofs added. 'He wants to get back to his level, he wants to help.' \nDraxler remains keen on a move away from the Volkswagen Arena, but he insists that he will not push for a deal to be done like he did during the previous window. \nDraxler runs with the ball during Wolfsburg's Bundesliga clash with Darmstadt this season\nThe former Schalke star unsuccessfully pushed for a move away from Wolfsburg last summer \n'There was a lot of speculation during the summer and some things were true, while others were false,' he told German magazine Kicker in September. 'There will likely be more speculation in January, but I will not initiate anything. \n'I am only human and what has happened has not left me unaffected. Football is business, though, and you have to focus on the task at hand. \n'It is not always easy, but I know what's expected from me. I will work hard to do just that. \n'We had some differences of opinion, but we have set those apart. There is no issue any more.

    "text": "0 \nE-40’s Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil Vol. 2 single “ Function” earned gold status earlier this month. The YG , IAMSU! and Problem -assisted banger has also inspired the moniker of a monthly Hip Hop experience in Mexico City. \n“The whole goal of ‘Function’ is to really provide a place for rap fans here in Mexico City to come hang out and bridge the gap between the underground Hip Hop scene here and what I know back in the U.S.,” explained Houston’s own Fat Tony to DX in a recent phone conversation. \nAccording to the RABDARGAB rapper, the idea came after performing at last year’s NRMAL Music Festival taking place in the largest metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere. Coming back to the city this past February, he linked up with local promoters who were really into Hip Hop but who lacked the outlet to reach out to more artists. \n“I could tell that Hip Hop wasn’t as popular in this city as it was in the U.S., but the people that I met who were into it were deeply into it,” he said. \nBeing a fan of the League Of Starz-produced E-40 single, Fat Tony felt the title perfectly applied to his ambition. \n“Honestly, I love that song,” he said. “It’s a good way to describe the party and it alludes to the fact that people are jumping around and having fun. Not just standing around and watching, everyone is as involved in it as the performer.” \nThe structure for “Function” is simple. \nEvery show features an international artist plus a local Mexican artist. Meanwhile, Fat Tony serves as the resident DJ and handles administrative duties. Giving suggestions for some of his favorite emcees from the area, he named Yoga Fire and El Aleman. \n“It’s really not about me as an artist but, it’s about me as a curator and DJ,” he explained. “I’m the one who hand picks all the talent to perform and I’m the one that found the budget, sponsors and set everything up on the administrative side. I promote it along with the venue and sponsors I have on board.” \nFat Tony also hopes his events will broaden the rap taste for fans of Hip Hop within the city who are more into pure East Coast sounds. \n“One thing that I noticed about rap fans out there earlier on is that a lot of Hip Hop fans here were closed minded as they were only into East Coast 90s boom bap and other styles of rap was foreign to them,” he explained. “One major thing that I wanted to accomplish with my parties was to let them know that Hip Hop is a diverse and complicated genre full of nuances and you can’t limit it to one sound. I play Gucci Mane and Gang Starr . I’ll play Lil B and Three 6 Mafia . I’ll play Common and Outkast.” \nUnfortunately, Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency may dismantle progress he’s made in Mexico City. Fat Tony calls the idea of building a large wall on the Mexican border “totally bullshit.” \n“I had a thought that this might be some of the last times for the next couple of years that Mexican rap fans get to see American artists and vice-versa,” he continued. “It’s been on my mind the entire time and it’s really motivated me to go harder with this knowing that there is a real chance it’ll be more difficult to do this next year. I would be completely embarrassed if the United States did that to Mexico.” \nWhile Fat Tony attempts to establish Mexico City as Hip Hop’s next international hub, he’s also continuing his own output of musical content. Releasing “Legal Weed” the day after the presidential election, he joined producer Kyle Mabson as duo Charge It To The Game. Though the two dropped the Urban Hall of Fame EP earlier this year, they also have plans for a full-length LP in 2017. A solo album from him is due around that time as well.  ",

The Hello singer thanked her band and the audience who had come out to support her in Phoenix, Arizona saying: \"Give it up for my band! Give it up for me! I did it! I'll see you on the other side. In a couple of years, I'll be back, and you won't be able to get rid of me.\" \nBefore leaving the stage, the 28-year-old was then heard saying she was going to \"have a baby\".

Media: brian.rogers@chron.com / The Houston Chronicle \nA Texas middle school teacher who was impregnated by a 13-year-old student could face up to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child. \nAlexandria Vera, who was arrested in June, told police that she fell in love with one of her students after the two began a relationship through Instagram messages. The 24-year-old former eighth-grade English teacher at Stovall Middle School in Houston also said that the boy's family was supportive of the affair. \nVera, who pleaded guilty on Wednesday, was initially charged with continuous sexual assault of a child, which carries a maximum punishment of life in prison. By pleading guilty to a lesser charge, her sentence was capped at 30 years, according to the Houston Chronicle. \nShe also is eligible for deferred adjudication, in which case she will be placed on probation and will have no felony on her record if she successfully completes the terms, the Houston Chronicle reported. \n\"We're very much hoping for deferred adjudication,\" Vera's attorney, Ricardo Rodriguez, said, according to the Houston Chronicle.

She said she initially resisted the boy's advances until sometime last fall, when she agreed to hang out with her student. \nProsecutors say Vera and the teen had sex almost every day for nine months. She told investigators that they love each other, according to court documents. During the relationship, Vera told her neighbors that the boy was her brother, according to KHOU, a CBS affiliate. \nThe boy's parents had known of the relationship since October of last year, and they accepted it, Vera told police. \nA police investigation began earlier this year after the school principal received a tip about Vera. She told police that she had gotten pregnant and had an abortion after Child Protective Services questioned her about the relationship in February, according to KTRK-TV, an ABC affiliate. \nVera has been free on a $100,000 bail and has been wearing a GPS ankle monitor. She's scheduled for a sentencing hearing in January. \nThe now-14-year-old boy, who also admitted to the sexual relationship, is in foster care and will remain there at least until August, according to KHOU. The boy's mother also was investigated by Child Protective Services, according to media reports. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

    "text": "\n. At least we finally got to play its broken, confusing battle system. Final Fantasy 15 \nTen years we waited for Final Fantasy 15. Ten years of rumors, speculation, and obsession over brief trailers for a game that started as a PlayStation 3 exclusive named Final Fantasy Versus 13. When it finally re-emerged as Final Fantasy 15 at E3 2013, we saw a trailer depicting a stunning fantasy world mixing hypermodern urban life with fantastic depictions of wildlife and magic. All of that culminated in this cover, a discarded poster for a male beauty pageant hosted by a Nick Lachey-less 98 Degrees and sponsored by L’Oreal. Where is the blonde guy even going? Everyone has to order you online, Final Fantasy 15, because they’ll be mortified buying you at a store. Final Fantasy 9 \nIn terms of cast lovability, Final Fantasy 9 ranks high in the series pantheon. There isn’t a dud among them. Zidane’s a classic lead, Vivi is the first personality behind the iconic black mage design, and Freya is almost Jim Hensonian in her warm mix of animal and human characteristics. Lumping them all together like this on the cover, though, captures none of the whimsy in their adventure. They look like a brochure for an online college where cosplay is a major. Sign up today and you too can learn to make Amarant wigs! Final Fantasy 8 \nAnother example of how Final Fantasy would have been better served by sticking to its original cover art. Final Fantasy 8 is a very, very strange story about a witch from the future trying to take over the world by compressing the past and the future into a single time. And teenagers falling in love. Right. Chew on that. , we get an 8th grader’s attempt at sexy stoicism. Ease down on the lavender and we’ll all get through this, kid. Final Fantasy 14 \nThings are starting to improve, but not by much with Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn. (We’re going with A Realm Reborn rather than the original Final Fantasy 14 because, much like Square-Enix and its shareholders, we’re trying to forget it ever happened.) On the bright side, the Final Fantasy Judge is a remarkable piece of character design which is striking on its own even if it doesn’t evoke the broad swath of experiences in this MMO. On the other side, Cool Guy With Sword is a pretty generic video game cover theme. Final Fantasy 11 \nThe original Final Fantasy MMO definitely did a better job at capturing the spirit of the series. The plain white background with concept artist Yoshitaka Amano’s logo depicting a united, ephemeral band of adventurers is stirring. The bizarre amalgam of cutscene screenshots and logos beneath it undercut any sense of budding majesty, though. All these years later, the cover is as much a monument to hilariously named internet services like PlayOnline as it as a work of art. Final Fantasy 5 \nNow we come to the good stuff. Final Fantasy 5, another early entry that waited until the Game Boy Advance to come west, benefits from a cover that’s far more romantic than the game itself. This is, after all, a game about a guy named Buttz whose best friend is a giant chicken and your mission is to fight random battle after random battle so he can slowly learn barely distinguishable jobs. Amano’s delicate characters on the cover, though, hint at a wispy world where even dudes named Buttz can be heartthrobs. Final Fantasy 3 \nWhat Final Fantasy 2 got so wrong, Final Fantasy 3 gets very right. Plain, graceful, and breathtaking, the Final Fantasy 3 cover for Nintendo DS is nearly perfect. The gorgeous logo captures how basic the game itself is. The original version on NES marked the first appearance of the Job System, where you train up characters in different vocations that can change as you go. That’s pretty much all there is to it. From a story perspective, it’s even straightforward good-versus-evil stuff than the first game. Beautiful and simple. Final Fantasy \nWhen Final Fantasy came out in 1990, the world still hadn’t gotten on board with JRPGs. Role-playing adventures were still largely stuck in 1970s Dungeons and Dragons mode, which is no bad thing. Everyone likes burly men and women wearing fur thongs in muddy landscapes. This cover graces up against that sort of Monster Guide territory with its big medieval weapons and crystal balls thing, but there’s a subtle quality to it that still feels distinctly Final Fantasy. It remains iconic even as the series’ more gossamer characteristics have come to the fore. Final Fantasy 12 \nOne of the primary criticisms leveled against Final Fantasy 12 by haters is that “it’s just weird Star Wars.” Is it really a criticism when the game clearly knows that it’s just riffing on the plot of the 1977 space opera? Even the cover apes the classic movie posters of Drew Struzan, combining the game’s cast and its ethereal world design into a pyramid like collage of romantic imagery. In the same way Sturzan arranged George Lucas characters to maximum effect, Final Fantasy 12’s cover pulls you into its Star Wars But Super Manga Sexy world. Just look at that sepia toned Balthier and Fran and tell me you don’t want to know about the hottest version of Han Solo and Chewbacca ever. Final Fantasy 7 \nWith the exception of the occasionally mangled English script, Square got everything right about Final Fantasy 7’s release in the West. Decades later, it’s still the nucleus of RPG fandom around the world because of its batshit story, iconic characters, amazing music, and sumptuous art. The American cover is arguably the best version, a ghostly but still vivid rendering of Cloud Strife as he stares up at the Shinra mako reactor, a classical depiction of resistance against corrupted power. It nails both the game’s nature as a technological showcase and as an environmentally conscious science fiction romance. Final Fantasy 4 \nThe first time around in the West, Final Fantasy 4 was called Final Fantasy 2, its difficulty was halved, and most of its characters lost their specialized abilities in an attempt to make the game more accessible. It also got a cover that was ust a logo against an angry red background . Not bad, but it doesn’t exactly embody a story where the hero has to literally fight the evil in his soul before flying a dwarven spaceship to the freaking moon. Many years later, Final Fantasy 4 made it to the US in an unedited, expanded form called Final Fantasy 4 Advance and it brought with it not just the sketched figure work of Yoshitaka Amano but a full, brand new painting. The thick color, angular bodies, and otherworldly faces capture everything about Final Fantasy 4 that’s kept people playing it for a quarter of a century. Final Fantasy 6 \nSo that Final Fantasy 3 SNES art we linked to above is pretty terrible. Our own Connor Sheridan described it as the crappy art on the side of a county fair haunted house. When it returned to the West appropriately named Final Fantasy 6 as part of the Final Fantasy Anthology, that mistake was remedied, and how. While Yoshitaka Amano’s logos and characters have appeared on other covers, Final Fantasy 6 marks the first time that one of his concept art landscapes made it to the cover as well. This portrait of Terra atop her Magitek armor before one of the game’s impossible cities actually manages to encapsulate everything Final Fantasy is at its best, an expert blend of sci-fi, fantasy, romance, and something wholly unique and strange that belongs just to this series. It’s sexy and strong, familiar and distant, all at the same time.

    "text": "Saskatchewan's universities are figuring out how to handle a budget cut with just a few months left in their fiscal years.\nThe province released its mid-year financial update Tuesday, and with it came $11.7 million of cuts to the Ministry of Advanced Education.\nSask. now projects $1B deficit for 2016-17 \nThe cuts include $9.3 million of reduced grants to post-secondary institutions, $1.5 million of money not yet allocated for preventative maintenance and renewal funding, $400,000 to post-secondary projects and $500,000 in administrative costs.\nAs for the institutions themselves, the University of Saskatchewan will see reductions of $5 million, the University of Regina will see $1.7 million, Saskatchewan Polytechnic faces $1.8 million and all other institutions will see $800,000.\nU of R to look for more savings University of Regina President and Vice-Chancellor Vianne Timmons said while they understand the financial situation the province is currently in, facing a cut now is especially challenging.\n\"To get the cut and absorb it within three months of an academic year, that's all we have left. It's going to be tough.\"\nThe university faces a $1.1-million reduction to its operating budget, a $300,000 clawback of a Workers' Compensation Board surplus rebate and a $275,000 cut to preventative maintenance.\nTimmons said the U of R hasn't received sufficient funding to balance its budget in the last few years. Increased enrolments helped the university absorb cuts last year, but Timmons said that likely won't happen this time.\n\"Every year we've gone in, looking for efficiencies and areas we can cut, and this will be another one.\"\nIf savings can't be found, Timmons said the university may have to go to its campuses to claw back funding.\nTimmons said the overall goal will be to make sure there is minimal impact to students, staff and faculty due to the cuts.\nU of S to draw from reserves At the University of Saskatchewan, the $5 million reduction is one that Michael Atkinson said can be absorbed out of the institution's reserves.\n\"This is why we have some reserves, to avoid that kind of forced deficit situation,\" said the interim provost and vice-president of academics.\nThe university faces a $3.1-million reduction to its operating budget, a $1.2-million clawback of a Workers' Compensation Board surplus rebate and a $720,000 cut to preventative maintenance.\nAtkinson also acknowledged the difficult situation the province is in financially, but he said he doesn't think universities will suffer down the road.\n\"There would be a concern if this was a long-term cut to the institution. But as we understand it, this is a one-time reduction in our budget for the fiscal year.\"",

    "text": "Why. Photo: WB \nI have a lot of problems with the television series you all know and love as Gilmore Girls . Lorelai and Rory are the actual worst . No one on this planet has ever spoken like Jess Mariano. Emily Gilmore is a queen and no one treats her as such. But perhaps my biggest issue with this show is the glaring eyesore of the title. Why on earth is that second \"g\" lowercase? Who was possessed to make such a structural error? Now, I never watched the show back in its original run, so I don’t have the same affection for the series as many my age do. And every damn time I watch this show it’s the first thing I think about, and I can’t shake the annoyance. To get to the bottom of this I did some significant research (read: Googling) and all I could find was this very short Reddit thread . So in lieu of an actual investigation, here are my best guesses at why the show chose this maddening grammatical faux pas for its title. \nTo represent the mother-daughter relationship. \nBig G, little G, big Lorelai, little Lorelai. The show is ostensibly about the power of love between a mother and daughter, but I think the series is really about a Connecticut grand dame who can’t get anyone to appreciate her dinner parties. This is the most obvious reason, but I think there’s another answer.\nTo illustrate the quirkiness of Stars Hollow. \nA pancake house that doesn’t sell pancakes. “Annual” traditions that only appear once over the course of seven years. A gazebo. This town is so wacky! Only a title so annoyingly incorrect would do for a town as ~unconventional~ as our dear setting.\nThe WB was trying to be hip. \nIn an effort to capture the elusive teen audience, the network tried speaking in AOL chat jargon. The original titled was actually GiLmOrE gIrLz.\nThe G’s growth was stunted from too much caffeine. \nFive cups a day really does affect your health.\nKirk was in charge of the title design and he forget to hit caps lock. \nJust like the forgotten Easter egg map before it, naming the show was a task Kirk was just not up for.\nThere was a budget issue. \nThe show spent so much money on the rights to Carole King’s seminal “Where You Lead” that there was no money left for a second capital G.\nHollywood’s oppressive gender wage gap. \nA much younger G was brought in to play alongside the veteran capital G to add some moxie. \nThe second capital G got lost trying to escape one of Amy Sherman-Palladino’s hats . \nThey are cavernous.\nThe first G requested she be the only capital in her contract. \nA notorious diva.",

REYES \nKerwin Espinosa, Eastern Visayas’ alleged biggest drug lord, claimed that a police general, through a middleman, formerly assigned in the said region asked him to send millions of pesos in exchange for protection. \nKerwin said he issued checks worth at least P3 million to Chief Supt. Asher Dolina, former Eastern Visayas police regional director, through his middleman Victor Espina, brother-in-law of former Philippine National Police (PNP) officer-in-charge, retired Deputy Director General Leonardo Espina, in 2015. \nThe ex-OIC, however, has vehemently denied his alleged involvement with Espinosa, saying his brother-in-law only used his name to transact with the suspected drug lord. ADVERTISEMENT \nREAD: Ex-PNP OIC Espina denies links with Kerwin \nSpeaking before the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs on Wednesday, Kerwin said Victor, sometime in 2015, met him and told him Dolina was asking for P500,000 monthly “SOP” or protection money. \nKerwin asked Victor to lower Dolina’s price to P300,000 because he there were many officials and personalities in Kerwin’s payroll. \nREAD: Kerwin Espinosa names cops in drug payola \n“Ang plano pala ni RD (Regional Director), humingi sa akin ng SOP or monthly protection money na halagang P500,000 kada buwan. Pero sinabi ko kay Victor hindi ko ito kaya kasi marami na sila, tumawad ako ng 300k a month,” he said. \n(The RD planned to ask me protection money of P500,000 monthly. But I told Victor I cannot afford it because there were many of them in my payroll, so I asked him to bring down his asking price to P300,000 a month.) \n“Pagtawad ko ng P300,000 nagkasundo kami sa monthly ko. Kinabukasan noong paguusap namin ni Victor, pumunta siya sa bahay namin mga 8 ng umaga at pinakausap niya sakin sa phone si RD through sa phone ni Espina,” he added. \n(We agreed to bring it down to P300,000 monthly. The following morning, Victor went to my house at around 8, and he made me talk to RD.) \nKerwin’s first payment was worth P3 million. He said he deposited the money to the bank account of Victor’s female companion. \nAfter a week, Kerwin deposited another P2 million as an advance for Dolina’s monthly fee. \nHe said Dolina asked for an advance payment to buy a SUV. \n“Ang rason kasi daw kulang pera ang niya na pambili na Land Cruiser (His reason was he did not have enough money to buy a Land Cruiser),” Kerwin said. \nHe also paid Victor P1,250,000 and his brother Martin as agent’s fee. \nKerwin said he has bank statements to prove the deposits. \nDolina is a member of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) “Matikas” Class of 1983. He is set to retire on September 22, 2017. \nIn 2009, Dolina was dismissed after the Ombudsman held them liable for grave misconduct and dishonesty over the P4.54-million questionable procurement of rubber boats. But in June this year, the Court of Appeals reversed the Ombudsman’s decision, reinstating Dolina and 18 other officials. IDL",

The Warriors have now won 10 in a row, and have the best record in the league for the first time this season after the Clippers' loss to the Pistons Friday. \nThe Warriors shot 52 percent from the field, and held the Lakers to 37-percent shooting. Golden State only lost the rebounding battle by one despite having so many fewer offensive rebound opportunities, won the turnover battle (narrowly), had more points in the paint and more fast-break points.

The Warriors beat the Lakers by 24 and Steve Kerr called it one of the worst basketball games he's seen in his life pic.twitter.com/qRswBZYMDD — Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) November 26, 2016 \n\"We were awful,\" kind of sums up Kerr's position in a nutshell. \nNow, it's funny that Kerr was so blunt and harsh in a blowout win when everything is rolling for the Warriors, but it's also a telling quote. A win is not enough for Steve Kerr. USATSI \nThere are coaches, often former players (as Kerr is) that will take any win. It doesn't matter how the game was played, after the win they are ebullient and after losses they are distraught. These coaches are living and dying with results and everything else is secondary. But in an 82-game season, you're going to lose some games you play well in -- well, most teams will, maybe not the Warriors -- and win some in which you play terribly. Understanding that process and the difference is important. It's why Gregg Popovich lit up the Spurs after a win over the Mavericks . \nThe process matters. How you play matters. And the Warriors were sloppy (17 turnovers), the Lakers were just sloppier (18 turnovers). Golden State gave up 42 points in the paint, and 15 second-chance points. They generally played badly, they just made six more 3-pointers (11-of-28) than L.A. (5-of-22). It's a good thing that this is Kerr's approach. It means he values how the Warriors play over what the result is. If you let the opponent have open looks consistently, that's not good. If you don't move the ball well enough, that's not good. \nAt the same time, Kerr has to be careful. It's a long season, and the Warriors are going to have games where they just don't play well. Like the loss to the Spurs in the opener, for example. Getting a double-digit win that's never in doubt when you play poorly is a sign of how good the Warriors are (which everyone expected). You don't want to go overboard. But overall, this is a great example of what sets Kerr apart from so many coaches who wind up valuing results over process.",

By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: November 24, 2016 10:20 PM Demonetisation: Payments for the transactions under all the exempted categories will now be accepted only through old Rs. 500 notes (PTI/Reuters) \nMuch to the disappointment of the general public, Union Minister for Finance Arun Jaitley on Thursday announced that the government has decided not to extend the exemption on use of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. According to the Narendra Modi government, it has made some changes relating to operational aspects of the scheme relating to cancellation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes and the most imprtant ones among them are that no over the counter exchange of old notes will be entertained after midnight of 24.11.2016. However, certain other exemptions have been continued and these will apply till 15th December, 2016. Certain additions and modifications may well be made during this period, according to the government. \nHere are the salient features of what the government announced today: \ni) It has been observed that over the counter exchange of the old currency notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 denomination has shown a declining trend. It has further been felt that people may be encouraged and facilitated to deposit their old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes in their bank accounts. This will encourage people who are still unbanked, to open new bank accounts. Consequently, there will be no over the counter exchange of old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes after midnight of 24.11.2016. \n(ii) Government had also permitted various exemptions for certain transactions and activities wherein payment could be made through old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. It has been decided that all these exemptions, with the additions and modifications as detailed below, may be continued for a further period from the midnight of 24.11.2016 up to and inclusive of 15.12.2016 :- \n(a) Payments for the transactions under all the exempted categories will now be accepted only through old Rs. 500 notes; \n(b) Payment of School fees up to Rs. 2000 per student in Central Government, State Government, Municipality and local body schools; \n(c) Payment of fees in Central or State Government colleges; \n(d) Payments towards pre paid mobile top-up to a limit of Rs. 500 per top-up; \n(e) Purchase from Consumer Cooperative Stores will be limited to Rs. 5000 at a time; \n(f) Payment of current and arrear dues to utilities will be limited to only water and electricity. This facility will continue to be available only for individuals and households; \n(g) Considering that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways have continued the toll free arrangement at the toll plazas up to 2.12.2016, it has been decided that toll payment at these toll plazas may be made through old Rs. 500 notes from 3.12.2016 to 15.12.2016. \n(h) Foreign citizens will be permitted to exchange foreign currency up to Rs. 5000 per week. Necessary entry to this effect will be made in their passports. (Necessary instructions in this regard will be issued by the RBI .) \nThe government is facing an increasingly strident Opposition led by the Congress , which demanded that the NDA government revoke the limit imposed on withdrawal of funds by the people from banks. Speaking in Parliament, Congress leader Anand Sharma said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had destroyed the country’s financial system. He said, “The Narendra Modi government has broken The government is facing an increasingly strident Opposition led by the Congress, which demanded that the NDA government revoke the limit imposed on withdrawal of funds by the people from banks. Speaking in Parliament, Congress leader Anand Sharma said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had destroyed the country’s financial system. He said, “The Narendra Modi government has broken trust of the people and has wrecked the banking system of the nation. Our demand is that the Centre should revoke the withdrawal limit and free the people from inconvenience.” Later, both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were adjourned for the day over the demonetisation issue despite the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the pre-lunch session. The post-lunch session was called off as Congress members wanted Prime Minister’s presence throughout the debate, but PM Modi did not entertain their requests. \nEarlier, during the debate on demonetisation, former PM Manmohan Singh berated the Narendra Modi government over the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes and said that this would cost the country as much as 2% of GDP. He however, said that the Congress stood with the NDA over the fight against black money . \n ",

Rodrigo Londono spoke to foreign journalists Friday, a day after signing an accord to end a half-century conflict between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Londono says he's concerned for the safety of rebels who demobilize and says it's possible that \"many\" guerrillas will be killed by conservative opponents to peace.

By: FE Online | New Delhi  07 PM Ratan Tata stated that the black money economy in the country had ‘fueled tax evasion, money laundering and corruption.’ (Reuters) \nPraising the implementation of the demonetisation policy by the Narendra Modi government, Tata Sons interim chairman, Ratan Tata, today said that the bold step taken by the Prime Minister, to curb the flow of blackmoney in the country, will need the whole nation’s support. \nIn a tweet, expressing support towards the initiative taken by the central government, Ratan Tata stated that the black money economy in the country had ‘fueled tax evasion, money laundering and corruption.’ \nThe interim chairman of the Tata Sons group claimed demonetisation as one of the three vital economic reforms in the country, apart from GST and Delicensing. Tata also lauded Modi’s recent focus on the digital modes of payments instead of paper currencies, and claimed that the use of e-transaction will ‘enormously benefit’ the common, underprevileged and the poor, in a long run. \nCiting the increase in the circulation of blackmoney in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, had initiated the demonetisation policy, following which there had been an ban on currency notes of the denomination Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. With the implementation of the anti-graft policy by the center, there had been a chaotic situation among the common people in the country, with people desperately trying to replace their cash notes with the usable paper currencies from the banks and ATMs. And even as the policy completed two weeks of implementation, cash-starved people are seen standing in long queues, waiting for hours, outside the money-machines. \nAs the lack of usable cash hit the market, the use of digital payment system, saw a rapid rise among the common people of the country. E-wallet firms like Paytm,Mobiwik and Freecharge witnessed steep increase in their usage with people from unorganized sectors to street vendors using their e-transaction facilities, thereby initiating the formal use of cashless economy in India.

Article continues below Video: The angry Jose Mourinho reaction that got him sent off vs West Ham \n\"It’s also worth noting that Reigns actually defeats the Universal Champion at these events, which is very interesting for the company to book their top champion of the RAW brand to lose to the second-rate champion on those shows.\" \nIt is widely expected now that Owens and Reigns will face off at Roadblock on December 18, but whether or not the Universal title or/and the United States title will be on the line remains to be seen. \nAs expected, WWE is once again trying to push The Big Dog in the main event picture to turn him into a megastar and the face of the company, eventually replacing John Cena. His skills have definitely improved since the last time the company tried this, but he still isn't being accepted by most fans. \nThe problem is, if Reigns does win at Roadblock, the fans might have a negative reaction to it, as it is taking place in the state of Pennsylvania who have been known to have vocal fans. This was the same state Reigns won the Royal Rumble in 2015 which afterwards he was greeted by a chorus of boos. \nWWE always try to avoid negative reacts at their shows but one might occur if the former Shield member wins at the pay-per-view.

    "text": "Airport workers and supporters from around the world cheer as they rally for better wages at National Airport in October. Workers in the Washington region are the latest to join a national campaign for better wages for contract workers at airports across the world. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\nCabin cleaners, baggage handlers and wheelchair attendants at major U.S. hubs will join thousands of other low-wage airport workers in a national day of protest Tuesday to demand better wages.\nAuthorities say the demonstrations, planned for airports in New York, Los Angeles, Washington and elsewhere will have minimal impacts on operations, but workers are hoping they will draw the attention of travelers returning from the long Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Workers at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport are taking more serious steps and planning to strike.\nThis could be the largest demonstration of service industry workers as part of the growing labor movement known as the Fight for $15.\n[ Thanksgiving travelers get reprieve from O’Hare strike. But there’s always Christmas. ]\nOrganizers say their message to Washington, President-elect Trump and other elected officials is that they won’t stay quiet in regard to efforts to block wage increases, end healthcare options and deport immigrants.\n“We will take our first steps together to fight back for our families and communities,” Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union told members in a call to join the Nov. 29 national action. “Together we will keep fighting for $15 (an hour minimum wage), a union, racial, immigrant, and environmental justice.”\nAs part of the demonstrations, fast food restaurant workers plan to walk out on their jobs in cities across the country and be joined by other workers in healthcare, retail and maintenance. Street marches are planned to protest police killings of black Americans and Trump’s plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.\nIn Washington, workers from Reagan National and Dulles International airports will rally with supporters and announce a vote to go on strike in coming weeks. A year after joining the national campaign for better pay and benefits, the Washington area workers have shifted their fight to the airports’ governing body, demanding that it require firms doing business at the region’s two commercial airports to pay their workers a minimum of $15 per hour.\n[ Dulles and National Airport workers turn fight for better wages to Airports Authority ]\nDemonstrations are planned beginning at noon at 19 airports, serving 2 million passengers a day. They include Seattle, San Francisco, Newark, Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale.\n“Every day we make sure passengers get to their gates safely, get their luggage and get on a clean plane, but our families can’t get by,” said Nancy Vasquez, a skycap at Newark Liberty International Airport, who earns $2.10 an hour plus tips.\nIn the past two decades many of the service jobs at airports have been outsourced to companies that pay minimum wages and offer little or no benefits. A recent survey of workers at 30 U.S. airports found that 42 percent of the workers live in poverty.\nThe demonstrations are planned on the fourth anniversary of the launch of Fight for $15. Since the movement began, wage increases have been won in Los Angeles, New York, Newark, Minneapolis, Boston, Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland and Fort Lauderdale.",

She had been sentenced to a five year prison term. Handout \nAn Iranian dissident who secretly disclosed the excesses of prison brutality in the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations, endangering her own life, has escaped to Europe. She is now living at an undisclosed location for her safety. \nShabnam Madadzadeh, 29, was held for six years, serving a five year prison service, in some of the most infamous prisons of Iran's deeply politicised criminal justice system. Through letters she sent secretly from her cells, Madadzadeh drew attention to the often draconian conditions she and thousands of other women faced. \nShe called the on UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran to visit Raja'i Shahr and Gharchak prisons, where she was held. Madadzadeh's plight as a prisoner of conscience was raised by international NGOs and the US State Department before she finally escaped to Europe. \nInside Raja'i Shahr and Gharchak prisons, Madadzadeh was, like other prisoners, forced to watch the execution of fellow captives, lived under the threat of death and sexual violence, and was tortured while in the custody of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. \n\"In every moment, second by second you can feel death. The interrogators talk about execution every day and every day you think you are going to be executed,\" Madadzadeh told IBTimes UK during a telephone interview. \nAt Raja'i Shahr, Madadzadeh lived in a room she described as a \"corridor\", where 200 women were crammed, with only two toilets and unsanitary drinking water. The lights in the room were never turned off, depriving the inmates of sleep between brutal interrogation sessions. \n\"When I was under interrogation I was physically tortured too. Five or six men surrounded me and as they were questioning me they beat me, pulled my hair and hit my body,\" Madadzadeh said. \nHer interrogators hoped Madadzadeh would renounce the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran (PMOI) , an opposition group in Iran outlawed by the Mullah's regime and which advocates the overthrow of the Islamist regime. \nShe explained the worst punishment she could receive was to be sent to solitary confinement, but that it was the stories of sexual abuse in the prison which led her to realise she needed to speak out against her jailers. \n\"Inside there were girls who were raped by the guards. These girls and these women don't have anyone to help them or to hear them and [the guards] easily raped many of them,\" Madadzadeh said. Arash Mohammadi, now 25, who also recently arrived in Europe like Madadzadeh, described how he lived a \"constant nightmare\" while in prison Handout \n\"I can still see the face of a girl who told me she had been raped six times by a guard. It was horrible. My heart broke with her and when I was listening I would just cry because I was in prison and I could do nothing for them. \n\"I said to myself, you should be the voice of these women, because this the way to support these women and to fight the regime,\" she added. \nMen also face the threat of sexual violence in prison. Arash Mohammadi, 25, who also recently arrived in Europe like Madadzadeh described living \"constant nightmare\" in which he faced prolonged and vicious beatings and was threatened with rape. \n\" The interrogations would last 12 hours , there was a rack that I was put up on and then I would be tortured with beatings and also shocked with electric shocks. There would be three interrogators. One would ask the questions and the other two would carry on beating. \n\"Sometimes I would pass out and they would splash water on me until I gained consciousness again and then they would resume,\" Mohammadi explained. \nMohammadi was also told he had to denounce the PMOI and was subjected to eight days of 12-hour-long interrogations. For both Mohammadi and Madadzadeh the beatings served eventually to strengthen their resolve against the Iranian government. \n\"I believe all of these women were victims of the regime. Without any basic rights for any of the prisoners,\" Madadzadeh said. \n\"Especially for women in Iran. They don't have any rights and they are still without safety or people to help them,\" she added. More from IBTimes UK",

If on a page with about 27 names, a critical mind can find potential problems with 24 of them, then we are on to something here. My sixth sense tells me that in view of the government’s hurry to show results after many months of inactivity and disappointments, it may have been harried along to commit these errors. \nWhen I was observing my National Youth Service in Calabar, Cross River State in 1991, I noticed a phenomenon in which some young corps members like me did their primary assignment in more than one organisation. There was the one organisation where they had to report daily – if they cared enough – and others in which they merely showed up on salary day. I never went with them, but some of my friends would show up at the corper’s lodge with salaries from three or four places of ‘primary’ assignments from time to time. It was the good old days, by Nigerian standards. NYSC paid us N550 per month and I supplemented with another N350 from University of Calabar, where I worked at the Institute of Education under the headship of Professor Ralph Omojuwa who had then just returned from the US. My direct supervisor was Mr. Sam Udokang, in the office of the Registrar, Mrs Duke. Both Mrs Duke and Professor Omojuwa were very fine people – physically and otherwise. I regarded them in awe. \nAnd so it was that I was one of the few ‘mumus’ among the lot, who did not know how to play the game of ‘working’ in many places. Instead, I dedicated everything I had to this first job of mine and became a kind of darling to the Institute. I followed officials when they made their outreach travels to everywhere in Cross River and Akwa Ibom States. Akwa Ibom was a bit new then, and hadn’t come into its vast wealth. We would travel to places like Nsit Ubium, Ukanafun, Ikot Ansa, Ikot Osurua, Ikot Ekpene, Urue Ofong, Itu, Oron, Eket and the rest. And at the Cross River end, everywhere from Akamkpa to Odukpani, to Biase, Ugep, Obubra, Ikom and Ogoja. They almost retained me, but as a starry-eyed youth then I had to run back to Lagos in search of merchant bank work. They were the ones reigning then. I ended up at Citizens Bank, Ahmadu Bello Way in Victoria Island, and thus began a banking career. The rest as they say, is history. \nBack to Calabar. Some of the harder corpers would not even bother showing up at any place of primary assignment. Maybe those were the ‘wise’ ones who already knew what Nigeria was about as a joke. Some will lounge from one corper’s lodge to another, attending parties and pulling the chicks. Those were the big boys. Some just traveled back to Lagos or wherever it is they came from, altogether, and remained there until the service was over. While out of station, their salaries continued in the different places they were ‘serving’. Some would show up after a few months to collect their arrears in different locations. \nThinking back these days, I realise this could have been the beginning of the ghost workers’ syndrome. For if any of these guys had ended up in the civil service, there is NO WAY they would have been satisfied with only one salary, no matter how far they rise. The water they drink had been polluted from the beginning. I don’t mean that it started in 1991. I think by the time we served, it had become commonplace for corpers not to show up in their places of primary assignment, and so the bureaucrats that we met would actually suggest that you registered your name and get paid without showing up, while you went elsewhere and got another job. The Nigerian civil servant has always been devious, and the apparent neglect of his plight, the frequent inability to pay his salaries, has only made him/her harder and more heartless. With my interactions with younger people these days, I now realise that the bureaucrats always structure themselves into the deals. If a corper today would be paid, say N19,000, for not showing up at all, there is someone who takes at least N10,000 every month within the system. The system merely decayed further over the years, to its present level of abject dysfunction. As things stand, and with the level of desperation I’ve seen civil servants show, there will be greedy guys who would offer the corper just a tiny fraction, and sit on the rest these days. \nThere is always something to spend on in the civil service. Visit any agency – especially the ministries – on a Friday and you see them preparing for the weekend; travels for someone’s wedding or burial or oga’s birthday. Money needs to be raised. And we are talking of huge sums. If you attend these parties, you’ll be shocked to witness how civil servants spend money. Many permanent secretaries need at least N1.5 million every weekend. Their list of hangers-on and corporate beggars are a mile long. Those coming behind them have dreams too. And thus became entrenched the culture of ghost workers. Some will say it is the ‘cleanest’ way of cashing out every month. The Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, made it a point to go after ghost workers as she was appointed, but painfully, we have not seen or heard of anyone sacked, prosecuted or jailed for benefiting from the fraud of the 30,000 ghost workers that she discovered – after and in spite of the cleanup efforts of Madam Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. No names have even been published. Shocking. At every state level, they claim to be doing the same thing – even in the armed forces and police – but not a single beneficiary has been outed and made to pay from coolly pocketing so many billions based on fictitious names, dead people’s names and so on. My wager is that the racket is continuing and I even have a case on hand that needs be looked into. \nThe 200,000 New Employment on N-Power \nThe president announced recently that by December 1, 2016, state governments will start contacting/deploying the 200,000 young Nigerian graduates employed under the N-Power scheme. These young Nigerians are to be deployed into teaching, health and agricultural extension jobs, among others. The idea is a nice one, even though I would have preferred more focus to be put on jobs in the environmental sector, and on jobs that secondary school graduates could do. In my book, Change is Going to Come , I recommend something really close, which could take out at least 500,000 young people from the employment market, and unleash great productivity across Nigeria. My idea is that such an initiative should also be a veritable means of mobilising young Nigerians behind the initiatives of government. What is more? This could have been done with great urgency 18 months ago. At least it could have been started. But half bread, they say, is better than none. \nAlas, I have cause to be very worried about this N-Power employment of 200,000 Nigerians. I believe a great fraud is about to happen, and it is a fitting observation given how desperate Nigerians have recently become. From my little observation of a single page in the N-Power employment scheme, I believe some Nigerians are now so angry with the whole Nigerian project, they are willing and able to do any and everything to continue milking the system, right under President Buhari’s nose. If the plans of these bad guys are successful, they will be the ones pocketing MOST of the disbursements made to these fortunate N-Power employees. That would be N4.6 billion monthly, if those 200,000 people are paid N23,000 each as promised by government. Of course some of the employees are genuine, but come with me and see the anomaly. This sample list – which I recovered off Facebook – drew attention because of the oddity of the types of names coming from Borno State. We understand that these are meant to be ‘residents’ of Abadam Local Government in Borno State. In view of the activities of Boko Haram in that part of the country, it is intriguing that on a single page, there will be such density of non-indigenes. \nN-Power Recruitment Process \nBelow is a step-by-step guide to applying for jobs on the N-Power platform. As is obvious, the jobs are targeted at indigent but IT-savvy young Nigerian graduates. \n1. Visit the NPower portal npower.gov.ng ; 2. Click on the various programmes on www.npower.gov.ng and carefully read through them; 3. Choose the programme that you are qualified for and best suits your aspiration; 4. Click on the APPLY button at the bottom of the page to apply for your preferred programme. (Note: You will need to first register and then sign in with a unique username and password). Fill the form carefully and be certain to provide accurate information and documents to support your application; 5. After submitting, you will receive an acknowledgement email letter confirming the receipt of your application; 6. After 48 hours, you will be notified by email and in your portal profile whether you are eligible or not for the N-Power programme; 7. If you are unsuccessful, you may apply for future N-Power programes, if you meet the eligibility requirements; 8. If you are successful, you may then proceed to the test page at MY N-POWER PORTAL; 9. You will be required to write two tests; a general skills test and a programme specific test; 10. Depending on your choice, there may be a final interview before you are conditionally accepted into the N-Power programe. Otherwise you will receive an email confirming your provisional acceptance into the N-Power programme; 11. You will have to confirm your acceptance to secure your place; 12. Specific enrolment and training information will now be made available to you; If you have any difficulty at any point of your application process, please send an email to info@npower.gov.ng \nMy Concerns/Discoveries \nFrom the attached single page taken off the N-Power list of employed candidates who will soon be taken over by state governments, I made these observations: \n1. For a list generated by people who visited the Internet for registration, only two out of these names have any presence whatsoever on the Internet. These ‘young’ Nigerians who are also graduates, have no Facebook accounts, no twitter, no Instagram, nothing. These days, all around the world and in Nigeria too, the first thing people do when they meet someone is to ‘google’ them. Almost all these names taken as a sample, are not google-able; 2. This sample list – which I recovered off Facebook – drew attention because of the oddity of the types of names coming from Borno State. We understand that these are meant to be ‘residents’ of Abadam Local Government in Borno State. In view of the activities of Boko Haram in that part of the country, it is intriguing that on a single page, there will be such density of non-indigenes. But let us assume they are just patriotic Nigerians. We can put that in our left hand and forge ahead; 3. A simple Internet search revealed that there is no presence for “Obaseki Recebah” online except the one that registered at N-Power. I tried Obaseki Rebecca. That generic name exists but is an adult that doesn’t live in Nigeria. There are two “Ibe Ije”s on Facebook – or online in general. Both live in lagos. One works for an insurance company, the other is a businessman who graduated in 1994 and whose profile shows is married. The only Godson Ihemere online worked with BUA Group and now works with one ady.ng. according to his LinkedIn page. He is not a young man per se and doesn’t stay anywhere near Borno. Interestingly, the only Michelle Okwesa available online works with Prof Pius Adesanmi ‪‬at IAS Carleton Uni, Canada according to her LinkedIn page; 4. Further, even though Murtala Mohammed should be a generic name in the North, it isn’t. Three people bear that name online when I searched. Only two bear that exact combination. One is an elderly person with whom I share about 278 friends on Facebook. He is a very active fellow on social media. The other is a cool guy who was an ex-bank worker, but now runs his own company; 5. Gamsheya Gara does not exist anywhere on the Internet and has no footprints, except when he showed up as a government employee. The only Joel Otalu online is a staff of Standard Chartered Bank; Bulus Kururtsi does not exist anywhere but on N-Power employment list; Cynthia Adaeze are both female names (no surname). Juliana Aboyi does not exist anywhere as well. The same goes for Osarenoma Ohiwere, and Aboi Dorothy. Oriyomi Attairu sounds like a cynical Yoruba name to me, in the league of ‘Omoshetan Omorele Oyinbogo’; I profoundly believe that this otherwise great initiative has been fatally contaminated. It must be stopped for thorough review before it progresses to the state level and we lose track, and audit trail, or before new shenanigans climb on top of old ones in a country where we are profoundly sick at heart… \n6. Another interesting phenomenon obvious in this little sample is where people’s surnames are not known. So we have Ezeani U. (Ezeani is usually a surname, so in this case, U is unknown. It could be Uche, it could be Udo, or anything else); we have Adekunle G. (whom I initially thought would be a junior brother to the famous saxophonist, Kenny G, but someone explained to be that it could be our own famous musician, Adekunle Gold, trying to change his career and being humble about it). Then we have the joker of the bunch, “Na’ajatu NONE”. No, that is not some exotic African name. It is to tell us that Na’ajatu has no surname, simple; 7. Let us even crown a King for the lot. And that would be Igwe Eze. Now, that must be a prince from East of the Niger. The two names mean that this is an important personality. If one meets an Igbo man with such names, one asks questions about his lineage because he may go far in life. There are two Igwe Ezes online. One worked with UBA and became a big man. He now runs his own company. The other is a hard core Biafran who does business in Lagos. His real name is Eze Ochinawata. \nI believe there is a need to take down the entire list and use a comb to sift through very carefully before this thing goes too far. If on a page with about 27 names, a critical mind can find potential problems with 24 of them, then we are on to something here. My sixth sense tells me that in view of the government’s hurry to show results after many months of inactivity and disappointments, it may have been harried along to commit these errors. It may have also played, slam bang, into the hands of the guys who know what to do to profit from a situation like this. I believe that since the government did not do much of scrutiny and merely accepted applications ‘online’ – except if many were concocted – it may not have taken the pains to crosscheck who is what in this instance. There is a likelihood that at least half of the names of these new ‘employees’ are fake and programmed to the benefit of those who have always benefited from the ghost worker syndrome. I think some of the names show a very cynical mindset, hence the ease with which one can detect that they are fake. This is what happens when impunity grows wings. These guys are thumbing their noses at Nigeria. Too bad. \nAs I rounded up this article, I came across Mr. Ayo Olukotun’s write-up in today’s Punch (November 25, 2016) titled “Ghost Workers and Programmed Dysfunction”, in which he chronicled some of our sensational issues with ghost workers. He mentioned that Kwara State recently discovered 9,000 ghost workers on its payroll. Read more from him: \n“…It should be noted that the figure of fictitious names smuggled into the state payroll is almost one-third of the entire workforce and that salaries had not been paid for several months… These awkward facts open up a line of inquiry concerning whether the crunch in Kwara was brought about, in part by such moral howlers as falsifying the wage bill through the addition of names that do not exist…. Three years ago, for example, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former Minister of Finance, and Coordinating Minister for the Economy, informed the nation excitedly that as a result of the introduction of the Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System, across 215 Ministries, Departments and Agencies, government had fished out close to 47,000 “ghost” workers resulting in the saving of N119bn in the monthly wage bill. However, we now know that what was saved by the right hand was stolen by the left, to the extent that the “ghost” workers appear to have returned to the system with a vengeance.” \nI profoundly believe that this otherwise great initiative has been fatally contaminated. It must be stopped for thorough review before it progresses to the state level and we lose track, and audit trail, or before new shenanigans climb on top of old ones in a country where we are profoundly sick at heart and the government disappointingly has revealed no perspective on how we can even begin to broach a reorientation. \n‘Tope Fasua , an economist and consultant, is CEO of Global Analytics Consulting.

Radhika has asserted that today (28.11.2016) is the case hearing and hence the ouster of Sarathkumar and the others is null and void and similarly the Annual General Body Meeting is also not legal. The veteran actress said that the decision was taken without a quorum and many members who attended called her and told her that they were unaware of it. Radhika made it very clear that Sarathkumar has worked hard for the Sangam and also has lost his money from his pocket for the welfare schemes. She concluded that this drama was created by Vishal as a reaction to him being removed from the Producer’s Council and she is ready to debate with any of the new office bearers. Earlier Radhika had also challenged Treasurer Karthi to prove that misappropriation of fund had happened in the former administration. ",

The pulse-quickening, celebrity-filled catwalk event of the year : the Victoria’s Secret fashion show takes place in Paris with performances from Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. AP \nPARIS — The laciest, if not raciest, catwalk event of the year — aka, the Victoria’s Secret fashion show — took place Wednesday night in in the City of Light. Among the takeaways: performances by Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars, sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid joining forces, as well as a $3 million Fantasy bra modelled by Jasmine Tookes. Here are the highlights of the Paris show: Angels in red \nGuests shuffled into the huge steel-and-glass atrium of Paris’ Grand Palais to the sound of a string orchestra playing softly from a huge Arc de Triomphe decor. \nThe calm lasted only a few seconds, however, and was broken by the flash of red neon lights and bold rock music blasting out to announce the start of the 40-minute presentation, which infected the cheering guests. ADVERTISEMENT \nSwedish model Elsa Hosk strutted out fittingly with electric energy in a cropped bustier — enveloped in a huge, three-dimensional red Chinese dragon; Kendall Jenner — in blood red — wore thigh-high boots, a long-line plunging bra and suede angel wing and Gigi Hadid looked like she would take off in flight, sporting a hand-painted cape with an Aztec-pattern that billowed as she walked. \nThe high-octane show was divided into six thematic sections, reflected in the colorful styles that bore inches of bare skin: Road Ahead, Mountain Romance, Pink Nation, Secret Angel, Dark Angel and Bright Night Angel. \nThe signature wings fluttered throughout — in feather, silk, gold gild, suede and Swarovski crystal. \n“Not only do the wings get bigger but we tap into new artisans and people who do things with 3-D printing … that’s always the wonderful thing about working on the show,” said Victoria’s Secret Executive Producer Monica Mitro. \nAs the show ended, a million pieces of glittered ribbon fell on the angels and the adoring crowds. Model Alessandra Ambrosio displays a creation during the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show inside the Grand Palais, in Paris, Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. The pulse-quickening, celebrity-filled catwalk event of the year : the Victoria’s Secret fashion show takes place in Paris with performances from Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. AP Gaga, Mars, The Weeknd \nWith a retro bleached hairstyle, Lady Gaga gave a rousing and gutsy live performance of “Million Reasons” to the crowd, and appeared again for “A-YO.” \nAt one point her microphone got stuck in the tassels of her dark cowboy hat, but this didn’t stop the consummate professional, who continued singing “John Wayne” as Victoria’s Secret models danced with her and crisscrossed the runway rhythmically to the beat. \nAs the 30-year-old popstar ended her set, she walked over to kiss Hadid’s mother, reality TV star Yolanda Hadid, in her front row seat. (Before the show, Gaga treated her Instagram followers to a photo of herself in silver Victoria’s Secret underwear). \nBruno Mars also performed several times, ramping up the energy and using the catwalk as his stage — in signature shades, with tuxedo-wearing backing dancers jiving behind him. \nThe American singer had guests jumping up and down for funky performances of “24K Magic” and “Chunky.” \nBut it was perhaps The Weeknd that got the most cheers of the night. The singer serenaded Bella Hadid — with whom he has been romantically linked — with his hit song “Starboy,” and almost followed her up the catwalk as she walked in a lace gown with silk organza corset. $3 Million Fantasy Bra \nThe Victoria’s Secret Fantasy bra the 25-year-old Jasmine Tookes was selected to wear is considered the piece de resistance of the brand’s runway display. \nThe bra, glimmering with thousands of gemstones, was presented like crown jewels ahead of the show. An incredible work of art, it was designed by Eddie Borgo and hand-crafted over 700 hours with gems from jeweler AWMouzannar. \n“It is so beautiful. It’s covered in white diamonds and emeralds and it has about 9,000 gemstones. It cost $3 million — so stunning,” gushed Tookes backstage while she was having her hair done. \nIt’s the third time a black model has been chosen to model the Fantasy Bra. \nTookes said the garment was constructed on a mold of her upper body, literally made to measure. \nWhile the bra may be perfect for the runway presentation, Tookes joked she probably wouldn’t want to go for a jog in it, given its weight. \n“It’s very heavy; it weighs more than 450 karats. It weighs down on my shoulders a little bit, but it’s so worth it,” she said, cheekily adding: “I might jog out of this show with it though.” A (Hadid) family affair \nHadid, 52, was the proudest of mothers Wednesday night. \nFor the first time, the former model could boast that Bella was included in the Victoria’s Secret model line-up as well as Gigi for 2016. \n“Last year, Gigi got it and Bella didn’t get it and I felt awkward being there having Bella at home. And this year, it’s just so perfect because they’re both here. We’re celebrating, the sisters together,” she told The AP. \nThe three posed for cameras and kissed on the pink carpet following the collection — in a show of family love. \n“It’s all surreal. I mean, I came here when I was 16, modeling. So many years have gone by and to be here with both my girls.it’s emotional. I keep looking at them and pinching myself. Whoever thought that this would happen?” she added. The original angel \nShe was one of the original Victoria’s Secret models back in 1995. \nNow at 51 years old — and just as youthful-looking — Veronica Webb spoke to the AP about the challenges and particularities of the famed fashion show that she began 21 years ago. \n“I was in the first Victoria’s Secret show and it was one of the most challenging bookings that I ever did because, obviously, if you’re in a room and everyone else is dressed and you’re in your underwear it’s a little bit embarrassing,” she said, laughing. \nWebb, who made history as the first African-American to ever have a cosmetics contract, also recalled how important the experience boosted her professional life. \n“It was one of the proudest moments of my career also because it took so much discipline and making so many fitness goals to get there,” she said. \nEven Victoria’s Secret models get nervous \nBrazilian beauty Lais Ribeiro physically jumped when a loudspeaker bellowed there was just one hour until show time. \n“Butterflies just came stronger in my stomach. I’m getting very, very excited,” Ribeiro, 26, told The Associated Press. \nRibeiro knows more than most about the hidden dangers in a show such as this, where models in towering heels can injure themselves. She hurt her foot as a Victoria’s Secret Angel three years ago. \n“What am I scared of? I twisted my ankle and kind of broke my foot in the rehearsal three years ago. So I’m always scared of the high heels (that might make) me miss this amazing show,” she said. Security tight \nHours before Wednesday’s show began, hundreds of meters in the area around Paris’ Grand Palais and the Champs Elysées avenue were in near lock-down, barricaded with passing tourists and fashionistas alike getting frisked. \nBomb squad dogs sniffed out every single bag that entered the Grand Palais where the fashion show took place. \nParis remains in a state of emergency following last November’s Paris attacks at a concert hall and various spots around the capital. City of Angels \nThe Angels, as Victoria’s Secret top models are known, have taken Paris — and their Instagram accounts — by storm since flying into the City of Light on Sunday night. \nLed by Alessandra Ambrosio, the troupe posed for photos outside the Eiffel Tower on Tuesday morning as gob-smacked tourists stopped to take in the incredible views, which included the monument. \nJosephine Skriver, Adriana Lima, Lily Donaldson, Hosk, Lily Aldridge and Tookes wore assorted Angels T-shirts and skinny, figure-hugging black jeans. \nBut the fun continued online, with Lima posting a from-behind shot of her and Martha Hunt wearing thigh-high boots during the show’s preparations. \nMere mortals may use a face mask ahead of a glamorous night out — but these are Angels, and terrestrial rules don’t apply. \nTrending online were photos of some of the models using 24-karat gold sheet masks to prepare for the 2016 show.",

These are the stories of people doing difficult but important jobs—jobs that may get much more difficult and much more important in the years ahead. \n“My parents chose this country as their home, so I think about why they do that,” Nithya Nathan-Pineau says in this episode of Working. That speculation isn’t just personal for her, though—it’s also professionally resonant. \nToday, Nathan-Pineau serves as director of the Detained Children’s Program for the Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition , a nonprofit that provides legal services and other resources for those facing deportation. In that capacity, she and her colleagues work with hundreds of unaccompanied minors in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. That name, as Nathan-Pineau puts it, is “kind of a misnomer” since the “vast majority” are already in deportation proceedings by the time CAIR connects with them. \n“Most of the kids we meet with have been apprehended in the last week,” Nathan-Pineau explains. “They have been transported across the country. They have no idea where they are.” CAIR aspires to bring those young people up to speed, helping them understand what’s going on and what their options might be. It also aims to match kids with pro bono lawyers in the area, who Nathan-Pineau mentors on the ins and outs of immigration law. Advertisement \nNathan-Pineau, for her own right, also has a small caseload of her own, which is important in part because CAIR has more young people in need of representation than it does volunteers. In the lead up to a hearing, she and her co-workers will often interview their clients over a period of months, trying to put together a narrative that lets them show a judge the “whole person” and not just a series of line items on an application. \nThey often end up confronting terrible stories of conflict along the way. “One of the hardest things about our job is interviewing kids about the worst moments of their lives—the most vulnerable, scariest, most horrible things that have happened to them,” Nathan-Pineau says. “That’s something that never gets easier.” \nThings don’t always work out, of course. “Having an attorney really increases the chance that a child will have a successful outcome in court, but we don’t win all of our cases,” Nathan-Pineau acknowledges. Knowing that, though, doesn’t make it easier to lose. “I think about the consequences for that individual,” she says. “That, for me, is the hardest part of this work.” \nThe election of Trump—whose inflammatory rhetoric about immigration powered his campaign—has only amplified the urgency of Nathan-Pineau’s efforts. “We’re experiencing a lot of fear. And our clients are experiencing a lot of fear, because there’s so much uncertainty about what’s to come,” she says, explaining that in the days immediately after the election, kids were already asking questions about it, worried that they’d lose their ability to pursue their own cases. \nThat fear lingers for now, even as Nathan-Pineau and her “sad but energized” staff are working out to educate and inform new audiences. “Our advice to people is don’t panic,” Nathan-Pineau says. “And know your rights.” \nIn a Slate Plus extra, Nathan-Pineau talks about CAIR Coalition’s relationship with the Office of Refugee Resettlement and describes the condition in its facilities.

While CEO Jeff Bezos was quick to deny the claims , it seems not all is calm behind the curtain. \nA distressed Amazon employee has jumped off a building at the company’s Seattle headquarters in what police have described as a suicide attempt, Bloomberg reports . The incident occurred on Monday around 8:45AM local time. The man has survived the fall and has since been taken to a hospital in Seattle, police said. \nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, the employee, whose name wasn’t revealed by authorities, sent a distraught email note to CEO Jeff Bezos and co-workers prior to leaping off. Bloomberg writes: \nThe man had recently put in a request to transfer to a different department, but was placed on an employee improvement plan, a step that can lead to termination if performance isn’t improved, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing company personnel matters. \nThe anonymous source further said that, in the email, the employee voiced his frustrations with how Amazon handled his transfer request and hinted that he might harm himself. \n“Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover,” Amazon said in a statement. “He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nAmazon isn’t the only company that has faced accusations over its exploitative working conditions. Back in 2009, Chinese Foxconn factory employee Sun Danyong committed suicide after his house was raided following the disappearance of an iPhone prototype. \nWhat’s worrying is this isn’t an isolated case. More recently, another Foxconn factory employee jumped to his death from one of the company’s buildings after only one month at the job. \nTo come back to Amazon: While last year Bezos brushed off the incidents brought to light by the New York Times as “isolated anecdotes”, I’m not so sure this sort of excuse will fly this time around – and nor should it.",

    "text": "Even though doctors often tell parents that newborns will regain weight lost after birth within a week or two, many infants take much longer to achieve this milestone, a U.S. study suggests.\nNearly all newborns lose weight during the first days after birth, regardless of whether they are breastfed or formula fed. Many doctors expect babies to regain those lost ounces and surpass their birth weight within 10 to 14 days.\nBut by 14 days, 14 per cent of babies born vaginally and 24 per cent of infants delivered via cesarean section surgeries didn't return to their birth weight, the study of almost 144,000 newborns found.\nMore than half of newborns not breastfed in 1st hour, raising health risks, UNICEF says\n\"It is normal for newborns to lose a significant amount of weight in the first 1 to 3 days after delivery due to both urinating excess fluid and limited intake,\" said lead study author Dr. Ian Paul, a researcher at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\nC-section babies may lose more weight after birth because they come into the world more hydrated than other infants due to intravenous fluids given to women prior to and during the surgery, Paul added by email.\n\"Upon birth, the newborn weighs relatively more after a C-section and has therefore more fluid to urinate out resulting in greater relative weight loss,\" Paul said.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that most newborns should surpass their birth weight by the time they are 7 to 10 days old, with weekly gains of 4 to 7 ounces (113 grams to 198 grams) for the first several months of life.\nFor the current study, researchers examined data on babies delivered at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Centers between 2009 and 2013. All of the babies were born at or near full term and had a healthy weight at birth.\nHalf of the newborns were at or above their birth weight at 9 and 10 days after vaginal and cesarean deliveries, respectively, researchers report in Pediatrics .\nAfter 21 days, however, 5 per cent of babies with vaginal births and 8 per cent of infants with cesarean deliveries still weren't back to their birth weights, the study also found.\nOne limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on how infants were fed once they went home from the hospital, which can influence the amount of weight they gain, the authors note.\nEven so, the findings should be reassuring to parents of babies that don't return to their birth weight within 7 to 10 days, said Tessa Crume, a researcher at the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora who wasn't involved in the study.\nIn particular, women who breastfeed should take these results as a reason not to panic, Crume added by email.\n\"For families who want to breastfeed, this is important reassurance that slower regain of infant birth weight does not signal inadequate maternal breast milk supply, but rather a normal newborn growth pattern,\" Crume said.\nTo increase the odds that breastfed babies will gain enough weight, though, women should focus on eating a healthy diet high in fruits, vegetables and healthy fats while they are pregnant and breastfeeding, Crume added by email.\nWomen can also increase their milk production by starting to breastfeed as soon as possible after delivery or by pumping breast milk, said Dr. Sarbattama Sen, a researcher at Harvard University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\nWhile parents shouldn't necessarily worry when babies don't regain their birth weight quickly, they should still watch for potential signs of trouble such as dehydration, inactivity, low urine or stool output and jaundice, Sen, who wasn't involved in the study, added by email.\n\"Parents whose infants have not regained birth weight by 7-10 days should continue to be closely monitored by healthcare providers,\" Sen said.\nAs long as babies get these checkups, slow and steady weight gain — even if it's slower than current guidelines suggest — may be just fine, said Dr. Charles Wood of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\"This study will help clinicians and parents reframe expectations around adequate weight gain in early life,\" Wood, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. © Thomson Reuters, 2016",

    "text": "What You Should Know About Catching Walleyes Here’s a Primer on Finding and Catching Walleyes Photo © Ken Schultz By Ken Schultz Updated February 05, 2016 . \nWhen it comes to discussing general fishing techniques for walleyes , here are some key things to remember about this species: walleyes are a schooling species often found in concentrations. they are often not aggressive feeders and therefore can sometimes be challenging to catch. they are susceptible to a wide range of techniques. they have light-sensitive eyes that theoretically make them most active in low-light and dark situations in many environments, but they do feed during daylight hours, and can be caught in the day. they relate to baitfish presence. in certain environments they relate heavily to structure. Bait and Vegetation \nThe primary food for walleyes varies, often being whatever small fish are most prevalent in a given body of water. The activities of the predominant forage have a bearing on where walleyes are: suspended in open water, hugging the bottom along sandbars or reefs or points, waiting along weedlines, etc. The types of structure or objects that they favor include rock reefs, sandbars, gravel bars, points, weeds, rocky or riprap causeways or shorelines, and creek channels. \ncontinue reading below our video The Fastest Miles Ever Run \nWalleyes are particularly known for congregating in or along the edges of vegetation. Walleye weeds, for the most part, are submerged, sometimes slightly visible on or near the surface, especially in shallow water, and often deeper and out of sight. Thick clumps of weeds are preferable to scattered weeds, because the former offer more cover. Clumped weeds is the easiest situation to fish. It may not be available, however, so scattered weeds become the second choice. Shorter weeds in moderately deep water are often preferred by walleyes than taller weeds in the same depth. Knowledgeable walleye anglers always look for the weedline and its depth, using their sonar . An excellent situation to find, though not one as readily fished, is where the weeds are thick and the edge is close to a sharp bottom dropoff. Working the edges of the weeds is particularly effective. Open Water \nIn some places, particularly large lakes, walleyes are also found in deep water, suspended or on the bottom where there are open, basin-like flats. Some walleyes, especially big ones and those that are likely to be feeding, do not hold to the traditional bottom and cover-providing structure, but are in open water to take advantage of migratory schools of baitfish prevalent in those waters, mainly smelt and alewives. So the walleyes relate to the presence of those fish. They may be in a few feet of water or in 20 to 30 feet, over a bottom that is much deeper. Presentations \nFishing presentations for walleyes run a gamut, but largely center on jigging, still-fishing or drifting with live bait, trolling with bait rigs, casting crankbaits, and trolling with plugs. Jigs are mostly used with bait (leeches, minnows, and worms), although hair- and grub-bodied jigs are effective as well. Fixed and slip floats are used for live bait fishing, although sometimes a jig and worm is fished below a float. Trolling rigs include weight-forward or June-bug-style spinners, as well as spinner-and-worm/leech harnesses, and walking or bottom-bouncing sinkers. \nMany walleye anglers have employed a controlled wind drifting and boat movement technique called backtrolling, which essentially is moving transom first, using a tiller-steered outboard motor or a transom-mounted electric motor to keep the boat in proper position. Jigs and rigs are used and almost always fished very slowly. \nWalleye anglers on big waters predominantly employ forward trolling , primarily using shallow to deep-diving plugs (and sometimes spoons), trolling them on flatlines, in-line planers, large sideplaner boards , and even downriggers . Fishing is done at precise depths for suspended and mobile walleyes. Locating the fish, getting to the precise depth, and having good lure action are of paramount importance. Seasonal Info \nWhen walleyes are spawning in rivers, other tributaries, and in shallow bays, fishing, where legal, is relatively easy, but becomes more difficult after spawning when the fish migrate out of rivers and bays into main lake structure and disperse. Through summer, various forms of structure, as well as deep water, are worked. In the fall, walleyes become more concentrated again and are especially found on main lake points that are close to deep water. In large lakes they will migrate toward the upper end where a river comes in, or to a dam end. This is a good time to get bigger fish. \nWalleye fishing is a bit different in rivers. The fish spawn through the same temperature range, and they migrate after spawning, although they may not go very far in smaller systems. In both spring and fall they may be located off the mouths of tributaries; in spring, they are drawn by spawning needs, in fall, by baitfish. They do not suspend, however, and are almost always caught by making bottom-oriented presentations. \nIn large river systems, many walleyes are caught close to dams in winter and spring. At other times, work the deep water off wing dams, island channel cuts, deep-water bridge abutments, and center channel edges. Look for walleyes along a river channel that has considerable depth as well, especially in midsummer. River Specifics \nRiprap is an especially favored walleye haunt in rivers, especially in the evening and if there is deep water nearby. Other prominent locales include cuts, where currents meet each other; eddies and slicks; along and behind islands; large rocks; and the head and tail of pools. River walleyes feed on assorted forage, including crayfish, hellgrammites, and minnows. They are caught by jigging; casting; trolling with spoons, spinners, and plugs; and fishing with live bait. \nJigs are the most effective river walleye lure, probably because they are worked close to the bottom and represent minnows or crayfish. Small and shallow rivers generally require ⅛- to ⅝-ounce jigs; in fast water you should increase weight. Fish jigs with the current; there is no need to actually jig them, and a slow rolling action is best. In spring and fall, use white, yellow, chartreuse, and silver colors; in summer use brown, black, green, or orange-and-brown. \nLive bait is also very effective. A live bait rig having a ¼- to 1-ounce weight, rigged with 20 inches of dropback leader and a No. 2 short-shanked hook, is used. Minnows, nightcrawlers, leeches, salamanders, waterdogs, and crayfish are used for bait, plus assorted minnows. Sinker style can be split shot, egg, or other bottom-bouncing type. Medium Tackle Covers Most Fishing Needs \nTackle needs for walleyes in lakes and rivers are not very complicated. Spinning rods from 5½ to 7 feet long in medium action, and reels filled with 8- to 12-pound line, are standard. Baitcasting tackle can be used as well, generally with slightly heavier strength line. In clear waters , fluorocarbon lines and leaders are desirable, and microfilament lines are a good main line choice. For trolling, especially when planer boards are used, longer rods and stouter gear may be necessary. Flycasting tackle is seldom appropriate, although it is possible to use when the fish are shallow and concentrated. Hardly any fly fishing is done by walleye devotees.",

    "text": "@xan_desanctis \nThis morning, Pope Francis released a document indefinitely extending the power of priests to forgive the sin of abortion. The pope initially granted this power one year ago at the start of the Catholic Church’s Jubilee Year of Mercy, which ended yesterday. \nSome outlets have twisted this news to imply that, with Pope Francis’s decision, the sinfulness of abortion has somehow lessened. For example, CNN’s homepage this morning led with the headline “Pope: Abortion is forgivable.” A Rewire piece on the topic claimed that the pope had “downgraded the level of sinfulness of abortion.” Meanwhile, the Independent asserts that “the measure represents a significant softening of the church’s stance on the issue of abortion.” \nIn reality, the Church’s stance on abortion as a moral evil hasn’t changed at all. “I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion is a grave sin, since it puts an end to an innocent life,” the pope’s letter notes. His decision to extend priests’ ability to forgive abortion doesn’t make it less sinful for a woman to make that choice or for a doctor to perform an abortion. Rather, it clarifies in formal teaching what was already in practice: God’s mercy is such that no sin, no matter how grave, cannot be forgiven. \nContrary to this understanding, the pope’s letter has also led some to believe that, before his decision, having an abortion was an unforgivable sin. In fact, his move was largely symbolic. Prior to the Year of Mercy, abortion was forgivable, but it was necessary for a person receive the sacrament of confession from a bishop rather than a regular priest. This was due to the fact that, under Church teaching, any Catholic who procures an abortion is automatically excommunicated, a penalty that only bishops, cardinals, or the pope himself can lift. \nHowever, bishops are able to delegate this authority to priests, and in some regions such as the U.S. and Britain, priests have already been permitted by bishops to absolve the sin of procuring an abortion. The pope’s decision won’t actually change anything in the way that American Catholics seek and receive forgiveness for abortion-related sins. The Corner",

    "text": "SuperSport face Chiefs acid test 23 November 2016, 12:00 \nKaizer Chiefs will be desperate to bounce back to winning ways when they host SuperSport United in an Absa Premiership encounter at FNB Stadium on Wednesday evening. \nKick-off is at 7.30pm. \nHaving suffered a 2-1 defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns over the past weekend, the Amakhosi will be eager to prove their metal against another Tshwane side and Gauteng rival. \nDespite the loss only being their second of the league season and first since the opening day of the campaign when they suffered defeat to Bidvest Wits - losing to two of your main title rivals, having been inferior on both occasions, doesn't bode well for the Soweto giants. \nBut, it is not all doom and gloom for the Glamour Boys who have at times played some good football this season, even if the results have not been forthcoming - especially of late. \nHead coach Steve Komphela has tried to shake things up of late, employing a 3-4-3 system with no fewer than six defensive-minded players included in his starting 11 for the clash against the Brazilians. \nThe formation failed to reap rewards in their defeat to Free State Stars on penalties in the Telkom Knockout Cup, even if the Amakhosi were unlucky to lose, and despite taking the lead against Sundowns - Chiefs were unable to hold on. \nPlaying with two wing-backs and three centre-backs has its advantages, and while many may fear that a change in outlook three months into the season will have a disastrous outcome - the players themselves have come out in defence of the new formation. \n“The system is quite catchy,” said Chiefs defender Daniel Cardoso. “We’ve only just started it now and unfortunately we conceded four goals, but it’s also a lapse of concentration with those silly goals. It’s something we can fix. I think it is a great formation, look at Chelsea. \n“They are playing it and they are playing brilliant football. I think it is something we have to work on and we will come out tops with more practice time. It’s not defensive. We are playing attacking football, maybe people think it’s defensive when the wing-backs track back to help defensively.” \nMidfielder George Maluleka agrees: “It’s not at all defensive,” he added. “If you look at the type of players we have, it accommodates a lot of us. There is nothing wrong with the formation. You saw against Free State Stars and even against Sundowns, our full-backs were in the attacking half, in the final third.\" \nSuperSport, like Chiefs, lost their opening game of the season, but haven't lost since with a 1-1 draw away to Baroka FC extending their unbeaten run in the league to eight matches. \nStuart Baxter has brought about real change at the club with the former Chiefs mentor out to inflict more pain on his former employers. \nThe likes of Kingston Nkhatha, Reneilwe Letsholonyane and Reyaad Pieterse will also be eager to prove their worth against their former side with the latter set to start between the posts. \nHaving played second fiddle to Itumeleng Khune at Chiefs, Pieterse moved to Matsatsantsa ahead of the 2016-17 season with the burly goal-minder set to finally get his chance in midweek following an injury to Ronwen Williams. \n\"Ronwen’s injured and it's quite a bad one and we didn’t get the free-kick by the way when he got a shoulder charge at the back, which is when it got damaged,\" said Baxter. \n\"So we're hoping. He’s going to do the MRI scan and we will see how bad it is but it doesn’t look good at the moment. He’s got nerve reaction going down his legs and that means it’s pretty bad.\" \nIn head-to-head stats, SuperSport and Chiefs have met in 51 league matches since 1990. \nBoth Matsatsantsa and Amakhosi have recorded 19 wins in the rivalry, while 13 matches have been drawn. \nChiefs have won 11 of their 26 home matches against United, suffering 11 defeats in the process. \nLast season the Amakhosi completed a league double over Matsatsantsa, winning 4-1 in Tshwane and 2-1 in the return game at home. \nThe teams have not played to a goalless draw in the league since the first half of the 2007/08 season. © Backpage TXT ",

    "text": "print \nA and N photography/Shutterstock \nIf you're in your early 20s and think you might be part of the growing group of people taking a new interest in marriage, the 37% Rule is for you. \nAccording to journalist Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths, coauthors of \" Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions ,\" that rule could help you save time looking for a spouse. \nThe 37% Rule basically says that when you need to screen a range of options in a limited amount of time — be they candidates for a job, new apartments, or potential romantic partners — the best time to make a decision is when you've looked at 37% of those options. \nAt that point in a selection process, you'll have gathered enough information to make an informed decision, but you won't have wasted too much time looking at more options than necessary. At the 37% mark, you've maximized your chance of selecting the best of the bunch. \nA common thought experiment to demonstrate this theory — developed by non-PC math guys in the 1960s — is called \"The Secretary Problem.\" \nIn the hypothetical, you can only screen secretaries once. If you reject a candidate, you can't go back and hire them later (since they might have accepted another job). The question is: How deep into the pool of applicants do you go to maximize your chance of finding the best one? \nIf you interview just three applicants, the authors explain, your best bet is making a decision based on the strength of the second candidate. If she's better than the first, you hire her. If she's not, you wait. If you have five applicants, you wait until the third to start judging. \nSo if you're looking for love between the ages of 18 and 40, the optimal age to start seriously considering your future husband or wife is just past your 26th birthday (37% into the 22-year span). Before then, you'll probably miss out on higher-quality partners, but after that, good options could start to become unavailable, decreasing your chances of finding \"the one.\" \nIn mathematics lingo, searching for a potential mate is known as an \"optimal stopping problem.\" Over 1,000 possibilities, Christian and Griffiths explain, you should pull the trigger on someone 36.81% of the way through. The bigger the pool of options, the closer to exactly 37% you can get. \nResearch about successful marriages seems to support the age sweet spot of 26. \nLast July, the University of Utah sociologist Nicholas H. Wolfinger discovered that the best ages to get married in order to avoid divorce are between 28 and 32. The range doesn't align exactly — 28 years old is closer to a 45% Rule — but partners usually decide on each other a while before their actual wedding. Wolfinger's analysis also revealed that a couple's chances of breaking up increased by 5% each year after age 32. \nIf you commit to settling down around 26, in other words, you're on the right track. \nThe 37% Rule isn't perfect. Since it borrows from the cold logic of math, it assumes that people have a reasonable understanding of what they want in a partner by 26, but doesn't account for the fact that what we look for in our partners may change dramatically between 18 and 40. \nWhat the 37% Rule does tell us is that 26 is the age when our dating decisions are most trustworthy — it's the point at which we can stop looking and start taking those big leaps of faith.

To show off just how powerful (pun intended) their solar technology is, the company is wiring the entire island of Ta'u in American Samoa, having installed a microgrid of solar energy panels and batteries over the past year. \nThese solar energy panels and batteries will supply close to 100 percent of the power needed by Ta'u's modest population of 600 people. \nThis microgrid will be able to power the entire island for three days without any sunlight, and has the capacity to recharge back to 100% within seven hours. The intention behind this project, of course, falls in line with the rest of Elon Musk's grandeur vision: to help lesson the carbon footprint of the world. \nThe project itself was funded by American Samoan and US authorities. Tesla has stated that the microgrid will offset the island's previous use of 109,500 gallons of diesel per year , along with the import shipping costs to get that fuel there in the first place. \nThis is a prime example of what sort of potential benefits may unfold from the Solarcity acquisition, however a long road remains ahead before the company is fully profitable.

    "text": "President Obama is heading into his administration's final weeks with a full agenda of new draft orders to consider, even though his successor has vowed to scale back job-killing regulation and cancel \"all illegal and overreaching executive orders.\"\nDespite the likelihood that US President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress would kill any controversial late-in-the-game moves by Mr. Obama, federal agencies under the Democratic president are pushing for a flurry of so-called \"midnight\" regulations on everything from the environment to transportation and financial marketplaces.\nThe White House was reviewing as many as 98 final regulations , as of Nov. 15, that could be implemented before Mr. Trump takes office, including 17 with an estimated annual economic impact of $100 million or more, Politico reported. But lawmakers have warned agency heads to avoid rushing to finalize rules or regulations before Obama leaves office.\nRecommended: Presidents and the economy: Who was best, worst? Take our quiz. \"Should you ignore this counsel, please be aware that we will work with our colleagues to ensure that Congress scrutinizes your actions – and, if appropriate, overturns them ,\" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R) of California, wrote in a letter last week.\nTest your knowledge Presidents and the economy: Who was best, worst? Take our quiz. Several of the new rules slated for installation before Trump assumes office include environmental protections that critics argue hamper business interests and economic potential. Although some offices had initially delayed implementation of their rules, expecting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to win on Election Day, the offices have pivoted to promulgate the rules quickly after Trump's unexpected win – and faced criticism.\n\"We're looking at the stack of regulations and the fact that the agencies are just as ill-prepared to make these new regulations work as we are confused on how we can possibly comply in such a short time ,\" Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government and public affairs at the Western Energy Alliance in Denver, told The Hill.\nOthers, however, contend that the push for environmental protections is consistent.\n\"We've seen a whole trajectory here of the Obama administration leaning into conservation and climate issues,\" Alex Taurel, the League of Conservation Voters deputy legislative director, told The Hill.\nUS Interior Department spokeswoman Jessica Kershaw said in an email that the administration is merely \"finishing the business we started and in some cases, finishing the business of prior administrations where decisions weren't complete when we took the helm.\"\nWith the addition of three monuments in February, Obama had designated more than 265 million acres of land and water – more than any other president since the US Antiquities Act afforded his office the power in 1906 to protect public lands – as The Christian Science Monitor reported:\nTo some, Mr. Obama's use of the 110-year-old Antiquities Act to unilaterally designate a massive area that holds everything from lava flows to Joshua trees is a major legacy move, part of the President’s \"commitment to aggressive action\" to preserve public lands in their natural state.\nBut to others, it smacks of federal overreach .\nRepublicans who hope to undo segments of Obama's legacy have a powerful tool to do so in the Congressional Review Act of 1996. The law will enable Congress in January to repeal, with a simple-majority vote, any agency rule completed after May 30, 2016, as Politico reported. After blocking any rule with that mechanism, the agency would be barred from enacting anything that is \"substantially the same.\"\nAnd some Republicans are pushing to bolster the tool by enabling Congress to repeal groups of regulation wholesale, instead of dismantling it piece by piece.",

(Credit: AP) \nA lot of powerful people in Donald Trump’s inner circle don’t want Mitt Romney to be the president-elect’s secretary of state. \nAlthough Trump has apparently told aides that Romney “looks the part” and would do a fine job in the role, many in the Republican establishment are dismayed with Romney’s harsh denunciations of Trump, and wish he would appoint someone more genuinely loyal. This includes Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. Receiving deluge of social media & private comms re: Romney Some Trump loyalists warn against Romney as sec of state https://t.co/HDtpjeJTc3 \n— Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) November 24, 2016 \nAccording to a report from The New York Times on Thursday, Trump’s chief strategist Stephen Bannon is also opposed to Romney’s selection because of the latter’s characterization of Trump as a “phony” and a “fraud” and are concerned that Romney would turn the State Department into a rogue agency. \nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich made his thoughts on Romney known during an interview with Fox News’ Tucker Carlson on Tuesday. After pointing out that Romney had once wanted to be president himself, he asked “to what degree would Romney, once he became secretary of state, represent himself?” In addition, Gingrich questioned “to what extent would he actually represent the kind of tough-minded ‘America first’ policies that Trump has campaigned on?” . @edhenry ‘s sources say Gov Mitt Romney may issue an apology to the President-elect to secure the Secretary of State position. Will it work? pic.twitter.com/ik9mNdUJxw \n— FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) November 25, 2016 \nSimilarly, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee questioned whether Romney is worthy of representing President-elect Trump in other countries given his earlier harsh rhetoric. \n“It would be a real insult to all those Donald Trump voters who worked really hard,” Huckabee explained on “Fox and Friends” on Wednesday. “When you go after a person who is the nominee of your party, who has been duly nominated by the voters . . . you’re savaging the voters. You’re not just savaging Donald Trump.” \nThe New York Times also pointed out that Conway defended her tweet by pointing out that the grass-roots supporters for Trump seem most outraged “not against something he said, but something he may do.” She also wrote that being “loyal” was the most important quality for a secretary of state. Fox News host Sean Hannity, who was one of Trump’s most loyal supporters during the presidential campaign, has been similarly distrusting toward Romney. “Mitt Romney reportedly is being considered for secretary of state?,” Hannity asked last Thursday. “Look, I think Mitt Romney would have been a great president but the way he acted here? No loyalty. He should not be under consideration, in my view. Your thoughts.” Romney’s potential appointment could even alienate Trump from the regime of Russian dictator Vladimir Putin , whom he had previously considered to be one of his closest possible allies. The Russian publication Obozrevatel announced the possible pick with the headline “Secretary of State Russophobe,” while the state-owned channel NTV insisted that “in America and beyond its borders, Romney is called one of the biggest Russophobes.” Matthew Rozsa is a Ph.D. student in history at Lehigh University and a political columnist.

She would make him eat chicken matzo ball soup and dark chocolate cake and whisper to him how beautiful he was.

She would drag me to clandestine meetings with various lovers, who always knew where to get the best meringue in the city or that perfect slice of pizza. \nAs a teenager I would follow her from gay bar to gay bar, watching as she flirted and sang and drank.

    "text": "Hamilton’ s Brandon Victor Dixon Says “There’s Nothing to Apologize For.” by Charline Jao | 3:23   \nThe cast of Hamilton delivered a message to VP-elect Mike Pence over the weekend, telling him they hope the show will encourage him to fight for the rights of all Americans. Pence commented saying he didn’t take offense at the message, but Trump fired off a series of tweets demanding an apology from the cast. Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor who portrays Aaron Burr and who read the message, refused to talk less and smile more in a CBS appearance where he addressed some of the backlash. \nIn response to a comment saying that they could have spoke to him backstage, the actor responds that Pence should have had the option to come backstage, and encourages the soon-to-be VP to have a conversation with them there. To answer why he was the one to read the message, Dixon explains that it was a request from producer Jeffrey Seller and that he was happy to do it, and even felt honored to do so. \nFor me, I think the most important thing with respect to all of the emotions that everyone’s feeling after this election is to make sure people recognize that we are not alone. We are here together and we need to listen to one another and speak with one another and those of us who feel like maybe their voice has been marginalized or might become marginalized–it’s important to recognize that there are allies all over the place. \nDixon also reveals in the interview that Seller, director Thomas Kail, and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda were all involved in crafting the message. The message was then read in front of the cast, who made additional adjustments before it was presented for Pence. \nTo the demand of an apology, Dixon simply takes a sip from his cup and says, “There’s nothing to apologize for.” When asked whether he was worried this would set off other theater disruptions in the face of a recent audience interruption in Chicago (a man acted with extreme hostility and said things like “We won. Trump is President. Get over it”), the actor dismissed this concern. \nWhen you have a platform, art is meant to bring people together. It’s meant to raise consciousness. And when you have a platform like that–I told Jeffrey Sellers after that, “I applaud you all for not throwing away your shot. For taking a moment to spread a message of love. To spread a message of unity.” We’re not here to boo. We’re here to cheer each other on.” \nA point that wasn’t brought up in the interview were the various voices that called the incident a “distraction” from other news stories. It’s understandable that while we’re trying to balance the many horrendous, appalling, and urgent stories concerning Trump’s upcoming administrations (like the $25 million Trump University settlement ), many will feel frustrated that the majority of public attention is towards a specific story that feels like “fluff.” However, I think it’s important not to write off the words of artists of color in a production as important and popular as Hamilton. Like Dixon says, that platform is powerful, and we should be paying attention to how they’re using it to facilitate conversation and change. There’s room for both of those stories, and as we get closer to inauguration, I imagine we’ll have to learn how to balance them even more. \nDixon voices everything that theatre should strive for and even extends an offer that mirrors the Trump seat George Takei saved at Allegiance. “We welcome Donald Trump here at Hamilton, ” the actor says, “I think the power of the show and the way we tell it is undeniable. I think it’s important for everyone to see a show like ours.” \n(via Variety , Featured Image via CBS) \n ",

Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP Trump faces hurdles to reinstating waterboarding 1  /  4 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump backs waterboarding and his pick for CIA director has called those who have done it \"patriots\" not \"torturers.\" Yet a Trump administration faces steep legal and legislative hurdles to reinstate the interrogation practice that simulates drowning.\nUnder a law approved last year, all government employees, including intelligence agents, must abide by Army guidelines for interrogating prisoners — guidelines that don't permit waterboarding. Those rules are subject to review, but it's not clear if they can be revised to allow the practice.\nIf the Trump administration were to try to change the law or the guidelines, the effort would run into bipartisan opposition in Congress. The most formidable obstacle there would be a fellow Republican, John McCain . The Arizona senator, who was beaten as a prisoner of war in Vietnam in the 1960s, adamantly opposes waterboarding. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , he would be well-positioned to block any attempt to revive it.\nMcCain has clashed before with Trump, who during the campaign claimed the former Navy pilot wasn't a war hero because he had been captured. At a security conference in Canada last weekend, McCain indicated he was ready to take on Trump again as begins another six-year term after winning re-election.\n\"I don't give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do,\" McCain said. \"We will not waterboard. We will not do it.\"\nWaterboarding and other harsh methods were used in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to try to obtain useful information from terrorist suspects. Many intelligence, military and law enforcement officials say the practice is ineffective as well as immoral. They say it breaks down trust between the suspect and interrogators and often prompts a detainee to say anything to stop the harsh treatment.\nBut Trump, who revved up his supporters with tough talk against against Islamic State extremists, pledged to interrogate terrorist suspects with waterboarding and a \"hell of a lot worse.\"\n\"Don't tell me it doesn't work,\" Trump said. \"Torture works, OK folks?\"\nTrump's nominee for CIA is Rep. Mike Pompeo , a conservative congressman from Kansas who has criticized President Barack Obama for \"ending our interrogation program,\" which Obama did not do. Pompeo criticized the release of the Senate's 2014 report on harsh interrogation of detainees and argued that the CIA program operated within the law.\n\"Our men and women who were tasked to keep us safe in the aftermath of 9/11 — our military and our intelligence warriors — are ... not torturers, they are patriots,\" Pompeo said then.\nThe views of Trump's other nominees are more opaque.\nTrump's national security adviser, Retired Army Lt. General Michael Flynn , has not ruled out the use of waterboarding. \"If the nation was in grave danger from a terrorist attack involving weapons of mass destruction, and we had certain individuals in our custody with information that might avoid it, then I would probably OK enhanced interrogation techniques within certain limits,\" he told Politico in October.\nTrump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Ala., was one of a few senators who voted against bipartisan anti-torture provisions in 2005 and 2015. But in 2008, Sessions said: \"I am glad we are no longer utilizing waterboarding. I hope we never have to do it again.\" That was before the rise of IS militants.\nAnd on Tuesday, Trump told The New York Times that he asked retired Marine Gen. James Mattis , a strong prospect for defense secretary, about waterboarding and was surprised to hear Mattis does not favor it.\nWaterboarding has been prohibited since 2009. Two days after taking office, Obama issued an executive order prohibiting all government employees from using any interrogation method that wasn't spelled out in the Army Field Manual, a military how-to guide.\nWanting to ensure that no future president could tear up the order, McCain teamed up with Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif., to turn it into law. Their anti-torture amendment was adopted in a 78-21 bipartisan vote and became law late last year.\nThe law requires the Army to conduct a review of the field manual every three years in consultation with the attorney general, the FBI director and the director of national intelligence. The first review deadline is Dec. 19, 2017, during Trump's first year in office.\nIt's not clear if the review could result in changes allowing waterboarding or other harsh interrogation methods.\nThe best interrogation methods build rapport with suspects, according to the High-Value Detainee Group , a team of the nation's top interrogators who deploy to question detainees around the world. The group recently issued a report on the best interrogation practices, based on the latest behavioral and social science research.\nHuman rights advocates have long fought against any resumption of harsh interrogation techniques. They say the intelligence community stands firmly against it and point to a comment made this year by former CIA Director Michael Hayden . He said: \"If any future president wants (the) CIA to waterboard anybody, he better bring his own bucket, because CIA officers aren't going to do it.\"",

(Photo: Tony Ding/Associated Press) \nBack at Pickerington (Ohio) North high school, it seemed remote. \nBut on Saturday, it will be reality: Michigan All-America tight end Jake Butt and Ohio State All-America offensive lineman Pat Elflein, high school teammates, will meet before The Game. \n“I told him back in January when he got elected captain, I congratulated him,” Butt said this week. “We were both two-time captains for North in high school. I was like, ‘How cool would that be if we met at the 50-yard line before The Game (as captains)?’ And sure enough, that’s going to happen this week.” \nThe friendship that goes back to high school in Pickerington, a Columbus suburb, transcends Saturday’s battle between No. 2 Ohio State and No. 4 Michigan. \n► Related : BTN remembers 2006 Michigan-Ohio State game \n“We keep in touch,” Butt said. “When I say Pat’s a good friend of mine, I mean that. We stay in touch in season, out of season. I don’t really get to go home during the season so we don’t really get to see each other, but we stay in touch. We both care about each other.” \nYet this is a week that divides friends, especially those battling for the same goal. The winner has a good shot at reaching the College Football Playoff. \nElflein already has a national title from 2014, but that only means he wants another one. \nWhile the Buckeyes were soaring that year, Butt was returning from an ACL tear early and enduring a collapse and coach firing later in the season. \nMichigan defensive end Taco Charlton (Photo: Julia Nagy LSJ) \nFor them to meet with everything on the line two years later seemed improbable then. Now, it’s too real. \nThey’re the most visible representatives of their town, Pickerington, which has four players in this game, two on each side. Elflein is joined by Pickerington Central redshirt freshman defensive tackle Davon Hamilton and Butt has senior defensive end Taco Charlton. \nButt and Charlton both enrolled early their freshman year and lived together for a few years, making a few of the 31/2-hour drives back home together. \n“We still knew each other and once we both committed we started to talk more than we did before,” Charlton said. “Once we got here we were as close as can be. That’s my brother right there. We’re super close.” \n► Related : Michigan vs. Ohio State 2006: An oral history \nFor the city of Pickerington to produce three starters in this game, all who should be upper-round NFL draft picks, is unusual. \n“My class, the class above us, the class below us, we’ve got a lot of really good athletes and I think it helped growing up that we had a lot of talent so we could push each other,” said Butt, who never got serious interest from the Buckeyes in recruiting. “I guess that all played a factor in how we got to this level.” \nCharlton’s family will have divided loyalties. \n“It’s different — growing up 10-15 minutes from the stadium, actually being born at Ohio State University hospital — it’s different for my family, some of whom are Ohio State fans, they just cheer for me,” Charlton said. “It’s a weird week for them. But you’ve still got my mom, dad and little sister who are still die-hard Michigan fans now. So they definitely support me. It’ll be fun to play in my home city.” \nButt, Charlton and Elflein have brought Pickerington back to the forefront, a town physically close to one campus but on Saturday trapped between the two. \nIt’ll start at the 50-yard line for everyone, with two Pickerington kids shaking hands. \n“That will be cool for us,” Elflein told reporters in Columbus this week. “It will be cool for Pickerington, back home. And our families and friends that we grew up with. \n“It’s going to be cool to see two guys out of the same town, to make it and be captains of their teams, especially in a rivalry like this. It will be cool to represent Pickerington.” \nJeff Seidel contributed. Contact Mark Snyder at . Follow him on Twitter at @mark__snyder.

    "text": "Fracking report says no to controversial process without community consent Updated November 29, 2016 18:04:27 Map: Mount Gambier 5290 \nUnconventional gas exploration or production should not go ahead in South Australia's south-east without a social licence, the Natural Resources Committee has recommended. \nThe committee, which has spent two years looking into the industry and the process of hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\", tabled its report in State Parliament. \nIt also found that while the specific process of fracking was unlikely to pose significant risks to groundwater when properly managed, other processes associated with unconventional gas extraction, including mid to long-term well integrity and surface spills, presented risks that need to be considered. \nPresiding member Steph Key said the committee had determined a social licence does not yet exist for the development of an unconventional gas industry in the state's south-east. \n\"This has been made starkly apparent by widespread opposition from the local community and it is the overarching finding of the inquiry,\" Ms Key said. Committee's recommendations: Without social licence, unconventional gas exploration should not proceed Processes associated with unconventional gas exploration must be properly considered and managed A review of the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000 would be appropriate Potential for disruption to land and local communities should be addressed in agreements A definitive proposal for unconventional gas development should be produced before any further consideration can be given to potential economic benefits \n\"This is not to say unconventional gas exploration and development should never occur in the region, but that in the committee's view, obtaining social licence is a necessary precondition to such development occurring.\" \nIn the report, the committee said it received vivid evidence of a communication gap between the industry's proponents and the Limestone Coast community. \nOverall, 178 written submissions were received and 66 witnesses presented evidence, including residents and businesspeople from the south-east, along with local government representatives. \n\"Throughout the inquiry, all evidence the committee heard, both for and against unconventional gas development, has been in the context of myriad external forces including climate change considerations, production and export price, export demand, technological advances, renewable energy growth and very notably, public opinion,\" Ms Key said. Opposition proposes 10-year ban \nOpposition Leader Steven Marshall said he supported the report's findings, and wanted to prevent fracking in south-east SA. \n\"I announce today that if we're elected in March 2018 we'll put a 10 year moratorium on fracking in the south-east,\" Mr Marshall said. \n\"This is a vitally important very productive part of our state. At the moment the confidence of the primary producers in that area has been undermined by the threat of fracking in the south-east.\" \nBut Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis said a moratorium would put a stranglehold on economic development. \n\"He's [Mr Marshall] opposed to building infrastructure. He's opposed to a new hospital. Now he's opposed to the oil and gas sector and a referendum on nuclear industries,\" Mr Koutsantonis said. \n\"This man is trying to stifle SA and build on their fears rather than build up their hopes.\"",

    "text": "This article was originally published on The Conversation . Read the original article . \nPolls indicate that one demographic slice instrumental in electing Donald Trump was white women . Indeed, 53 percent of white women cast their votes in his direction . \nThere’s current debate on why this might be – blatant or veiled racism, admiration for Trump’s business prowess or supporting someone who’s fired up to protect us from terrorism and radical Islam. But one unrecognized and insidious force – one that some women will likely minimize or deny – is internalized gynophobia . \nMany people are familiar with the term homophobia – dislike of or prejudice against people who are homosexual. Some of us may even know the phrase “internalized homophobia” – when lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender and queer people take on society’s negative perceptions about them, leading to devaluation and poor regard for themselves. \nAs a clinical psychologist, I avoid engaging in armchair analysis. But watching this election, and the strong resistance to a female candidate, I’ve found myself wondering if the women who vehemently oppose Hillary Clinton suffer some kind of version of related self-loathing. And, I worry about the consequences for women’s health. \nIt’s curious to me that women were so opposed to a female candidate and unwilling to excuse her flaws – but that they overlooked the flaws of a male candidate who had made many disparaging words against women. \nWe do know that harmful words, attitudes and actions harm women’s health. The effects of rape, discrimination and harassment are long-lasting, affecting the personal and professional lives of women for decades. \nThe health effects of sexual assault for women across their lifespan are potentially enormous. For example, even after controlling for other childhood adversities, childhood sexual abuse was associated with the subsequent onset of 14 mood, anxiety and substance use disorders among women – depression, dysthymia, mania, agoraphobia, panic attack, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, alcohol problems, alcohol dependence, drug problems, drug dependence and severe drug dependence. Soak that in for a minute. \nThe frequency and intensity of sexual harassment are also related to physical and mental health problems for women, as well as difficulties in work and interpersonal activities . \nWas it hate speech? \nIf you’re a woman and you cast your ballot for Trump, I’m not looking to judge you. You are my family members and my friends. And I care about you deeply. \nI’m asking you to quietly consider how you feel about your own power – where you feel it comes from (your role as mother, daughter, spouse, worker) and how comfortable you are with sources of your power that are not defined by traditional nurturing roles. I’m also asking you to respectfully join me in thinking through this potential issue, as I believe it holds us and our country back. \nThis is important because of the potential health as well as social effects. Already, millions of women have felt at least temporarily depressed by the election of a man who they believe values women only if they look a certain way – tall, young, long-legged and big-breasted. He has repeatedly graded women on the “1-10” scale, saying that a woman with small breasts would have a hard time being rated “a 10.” In addition, he reportedly told talk show host Howard Stern that it was OK to call his daughter “a piece of ass.” Had he been speaking of another group of people, it might have been viewed as “hate speech.” \nRecently, three middle-aged white women friends from college called me up, out of the blue. They had gotten together for a girls’ weekend and wanted to say “hi.” I was delighted to hear from them. We hadn’t spoken in almost 15 years. \nAs the conversation went on, their negative opinions on Hillary came out from, “being a bad role model for our children by staying in a relationship with her husband after he cheated on her” to “not caring about the American people.” Stupefied, I began asking them questions to understand their thinking. \nI’m not saying that women ought to always like or support one another. But the vehemence which is projected onto the screen of Hillary is disconcerting and needs examination. The calls of “lock her up” did not come from men only. This leads me to wonder about the role of self-loathing. Woman holding a ‘lock her up’ sign. Evan Vucci/AP \nWomen voting for Trump may say something about how women feel about their own power as well as who has the power to govern. Political scientists have proved women’s overwhelming effectiveness in federal and state government. Thus, based on their effectiveness in office, one might think that the bias would be reversed, unless there’s something very deep going on inside. \nWith internalized gynophobia, there seems to be disproportionate dependence – believing that only men can take care of us, disempowerment without the protection and support of a man, severe self-limits in asking for our needs to be meet at home and on the job, and woman-bashing. \nOf course this is a simplification. And not every stress or intensity of being LGBTQ can be equated with being women. Women in the U.S. don’t typically experience fear of being disowned because of their gender, and we don’t typically face overt disapproval within our religious communities. \nWe also don’t have to come out or fear getting “outed.” Our family, friends, workplace, world and religion can tell we’re women by looking at us. But we do share some historical and contemporary parallel experiences with the LGBTQ population in terms of oppression – fear of discrimination or violence and societal judgment and disapproval. \nThe impact of internalized homophobia on psychological distress has been fairly well-documented. Fear and loathing of self negatively influences the mental health of the LGBTQ population. Gay men reporting higher levels of internalized homophobia are less likely to have come out of the closet and thus be their authentic selves. I wonder if the same could be true for women who experience internalized gynophobia. \nSimilar to sexually diverse populations, women are at an increased risk for mental health concerns . And there have been studies on women’s self-loathing and its relationship to acceptance of their bodies as well as eating patterns . \nA roster of contributing factors \nThere’s probably a host of conscious and unconscious reasons contributing to internalized gynophobia. Maybe personality traits like deference. Or maybe it’s coming from women from traditional backgrounds, who are taught through upbringing or socialization processes to be a dutiful and good girl. \n\nIt may also come from women who have learned to value themselves by their attractiveness and see their power solely or primarily through the seduction of and protection by men. \nWhatever the cause, the world could benefit from healthily addressing issues such as internalized gynophobia, expected rejection, stereotyping and oppression. Discrimination and sexual harassment at work go beyond even mental and physical health. Sexual harassment is a significant public health problem that also affects work-related satisfaction and functioning. \nOne potential mechanism to support sexual minorities’ resilience is the development of growth-fostering relationships – authentic and mutual connections with close LGBTQ friends. Others might be to acknowledge the gynophobia or sexism implicit in our world and work to counter the internalized gynophobia that may occur in us or others. \nAgain, I’m not saying that every woman should have been “with Her.” And let me be clear, this is not just about our feelings toward Hillary. Other powerful women in business or leadership has felt the deep cuts of rejection before – Martha Stewart, Carly Fiorina, Meg Whitman, Marisa Meyer, to name a few. \nBut in this post-election, it would be helpful and healing and maybe even protective for all of us to understand that Hillary’s femaleness was not the deal-breaker. And I offer my hand in community to all willing to explore this perspective further.",

LeBoeuf \nLiquids shared mouth-to-mouth by social insects contain proteins and small molecules that can influence the development and organisation of their colonies, according to new findings published in eLife . \nThe study from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, suggests Florida carpenter ants can collectively influence their communities by shifting the cocktail of proteins, hormones and other small molecules that they pass mouth-to-mouth to one another and their young through a process called trophallaxis. \n\"Food is passed to every adult and developing ant by trophallaxis. This creates a network of interactions linking every member of the colony,\" says senior author Laurent Keller, Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution. \n\"A lot of researchers consider trophallaxis only as a means of food-sharing,\" adds Professor Richard Benton of the Center for Integrative Genomics, also a senior author of the study. \"But trophallaxis occurs in other contexts, such as when an ant is reunited with a nest-mate after isolation. We therefore wanted to see if the fluid exchanged by trophallaxis contains molecules that allow ants to pass other chemical messages to each other, and not just food.\" \nTo answer this question, the team, led by first author and postdoctoral researcher Dr Adria LeBoeuf, analysed fluid from pairs of ants engaged in trophallaxis. Surprisingly, they identified a large number of proteins that appear to be involved in regulating the growth of ants, along with high levels of juvenile hormone , an important regulator of insect development, reproduction, and behaviour. Carpenter ants ( Camponotus floridanus ) are exchanging fluid mouth-to-mouth by trophallaxis. Credit: Adria C. LeBoeuf \nTo see what effect this hormone has on the growth of larvae fed by trophallaxis, the scientists added it to the food of larvae-rearing ants and discovered that the hormone made it twice as likely that the larvae would survive to reach adulthood. \n\"This indicates that juvenile hormone and other molecules transferred mouth-to-mouth over this social network could be used by the ants to collectively decide how their colony develops,\" says LeBoeuf. \"So, when the ants feed their larvae, they aren't just feeding them food, they are casting quantitative ballots for their colony, administering different amounts of growth-promoting components to influence the next generation. \n\"The effects of juvenile hormone that we see are consistent with previous studies in other ants and in bees where larvae treated with an analogue of this hormone tend to develop into larger workers and even queens.\" \nAlong with growth proteins and juvenile hormone, the team also identified small molecules and chemical signals in the carpenter ants' trophallactic liquid that help them recognize their nest-mates. They demonstrated for the first time the presence of chemical cues in the fluid that are known to be important in providing ants with a colony-specific odour that allows them to distinguish family from non-family members. \n\"Overall, we show that liquid transmitted among ants contains much more than food and digestive enzymes,\" adds LeBoeuf. \"Our findings suggest that trophallaxis underlies a private communication channel that ants use to direct the development of their young, similar to milk in mammals.\" \n\"More generally, this opens the possibility that the oral exchange of fluids, such as saliva, in other animals might also serve previously unsuspected roles.\"",

    "text": "FYI, Almonds Are Not Nuts. And Neither Are A Lot Of Other 'Nuts.' Everything we know is a lie. 11/28/2016 11:09 am ET \nWe all know almonds are a healthy snack and a great dessert ingredient . \nBut get this: almonds are not nuts. They’re seeds of a fruit. \nMore specifically, they’re seeds of the almond fruit , which grows on a tree and is very similar to a peach, botanically speaking. When the almond fruit is ripe, we remove its flesh and shell, then eat the small kernel inside. Check it out: Flowerphotos via Getty Images Unripe almond fruit hangs on a tree. Bloomberg via Getty Images A farmer cuts open the fruit's fuzzy hull to reveal the seed inside. ullstein bild via Getty Images When the almonds are ripe, their hulls split open. Andia via Getty Images The hulls get dry and curled , exposing the inner almond pit. GomezDavid via Getty Images See that pit in there? The seed we eat is just underneath it. Here’s why almonds are not nuts. \nIn the botanical world, a nut is a dry, hard-shelled fruit . But as you can see, almonds have a fleshy outer layer. Therefore they’re technically not nuts, but a different kind of fruit called a drupe , said Tom Gradziel , an almond researcher at the University of California, Davis. \nYou could compare them to another drupe you know well. \n“Almonds are basically peaches,” Gradziel told HuffPost. “But instead of the fruity part becoming fleshy, most of it sizes up in the kernel.” \nAlmonds are indeed a member of the prunus family that includes peaches, though not the same species. The plants are incredibly similar . Both Gradziel and Richard Rosecrance , a fruit tree researcher at California State University, Chico, told of farmers in Asia who breed peach-like fruits for their large, edible kernels, which can be removed from the pit and snacked on like almonds. \nIn the U.S., farmers mix almonds’ outer flesh into feed for dairy cows , Gradziel said. A lot of other nuts aren’t “nuts,” either. \nMany of the other foods we call “nuts” aren’t actually nuts , either. Similar to almonds, walnuts and pistachios are are not nuts because they grow fleshy, leathery exteriors instead of hard shells, Gradziel says. \nSee? Tim Graham via Getty Images A walnut tree. ATTA KENARE via Getty Images A pistachio tree. \nThere are other factors that determine true nuts from non-nuts, but looking at their shell (or lack thereof) is one obvious way botanists tell the difference. Gradziel confirmed that cashews and pecans aren’t nuts, either. \nAn acorn , on the other hand, is a prime example of a true nut because it has a hard outer shell. However, you’re still allowed to call them “nuts.” \nThe culinary use of the word “nut” is much broader and looser in definition, so you can use it as you always have and fare just fine around cooks or fellow snackers. A scientist, however, may want to debate the issue. And allergies are a nutty case, too. \nWe also use a loose definition of “nut” when talking about allergies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration groups almonds with walnuts and pecans in a broader “tree nut” category. \nYou can be allergic to just one “tree nut,” but some groups of nuts tend to cause allergy symptoms together , said Dr. James Baker , chief medical officer of the the patient advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education. People who are allergic to walnuts also tend to get irritated by pecans, he says. If you’re allergic to almonds, it’s more likely you’re allergic to cashews, Brazil nuts and pistachios. Hazelnuts fall into both groups. \nThis, Baker says, is because many “nuts” have similar allergy-causing proteins with a particular tendency to bring on symptoms. If you have allergy symptoms after eating nuts ― either true nuts or what we merely call nuts ― Baker recommends visiting an allergist. \nIf not, snack on.",

And if Ntsiki Mazwai's latest Twitter tirade is anything to go by, then it seems the dispute is nowhere near over. Ntsiki shades Zuma's congrats message to Trump: We don't even want him as president! Thandiswa is 'not surprised' by sister Ntsiki's Twitter outbursts Ntsiki Mazwai slams Mbalula over 'one-night stand' comments In a series of tweets, the outspoken poet and activist, once again, expressed her dislike for weaves. She claimed that it's an attempt for black women to like others.\nYup pic.twitter.com/Akp0EgJcFQ\n— Daughter Of The Soil (@ntsikimazwai) November 29, 2016 Ntsiki, who happens to be an ambassador for a hair care range, suggested that black girls who wear weaves have a \"crisis of assimilation\".\nU dnt have to...u just feel touched when i tweet cos u know its true.

Unxilile\n— Lama (@Lulama__) November 29, 2016 Ntsiki stood firm in her thoughts, saying that black girls should embrace their natural hair, and not be \"desperate to look like others\".\nShe also said that \"weaves are much dirtier than natural hair\".\n\"For as long as you run away from what [you] truly look like....you're punishing yourself,\" she continued.\n\"Chasing other identities makes [you] look damn insecure....ngathi awuzithembanga [it's like you don't trust yourself].\"",

Barrett.\n“That wasn’t a first down,” Harbaugh said flatly (read more of Harbaugh’s comments here ).\nFrom the Big Ten’s news release:\nThe Big Ten determined that Harbaugh’s postgame comments regarding officials were in violation of Big Ten Conference Agreement 10.01, which states in part that “The Big Ten Conference expects all contests involving a member institution to be conducted without compromise to any fundamental element of sportsmanship. Such fundamental elements include integrity of competition, civility toward all, and respect, particularly toward opponents and officials.”\nCoaches are teachers as well, and there is an expectation that they set the example for students and others in the area of sportsmanship.\nIn addition to the controversial spot that awarded Barrett a first down (preceding Curtis Samuel’s game-winning touchdown run), Harbaugh was upset about a pass interference call on Ohio State’s game-tying fourth quarter drive. The coach was also flagged 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh wasn’t too happy with the officiating in the Wolverines’ loss to Ohio State.

    "text": "WATCH: Aqib Talib Shoves Jordan Norwood After Muffed Punt Against Chiefs Chad Jensen 2:41 PM / Originally published on Mile High Huddle Aqib Talib was fired up after Jordan Norwood muffed a punt early in the fourth quarter of Denver's 30-27 overtime loss to Kansas City. \nThe way the Denver Broncos play football — keeping their cards close to the vest — their margin for error is slim. They can ill-afford mental errors, coverage breakdowns or costly turnovers, especially late in a single-score game. \nField position becomes a penultimate key. \nhttp://www.scout.com/story/1731476-scout-s-cyber-monday-sale-is-on?s=101 Unfortunately, a multitude of errors was how the cookie crumbled for the Broncos on Sunday night vs. the Kansas City Chiefs . There were several Denver breakdowns — a safety and free kick returned for a touchdown among them. \nOne of the toughest pills to swallow was Jordan Norwood 's muffed punt early in the fourth quarter, which was recovered by the Chiefs. The Broncos were trailing the Chiefs by six points and the defense had just forced Alex Smith off the field on a three-and-out. \nKansas City punter Dustin Colquitt was forced to punt from his own endzone. Had Norwood simply secured the catch, it would have given Trevor Siemian and company excellent field position, inside Kansas City territory. \nInstead, the Broncos defense, which had been battling for three hard-fought quarters, were forced to trot back out onto the field. As Norwood was exiting the field, cornerback Aqib Talib and the defense were taking it. Talib could be seen shoving Norwood from behind, with some choice words. \nhttps://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/803087052120072193 \nThe Broncos defense forced Kansas City to punt again on the ensuing possession, but it flipped field position, pinning Siemian and the offense back on their own 12-yard line. The Chiefs didn't get any points out of it, but it was a mental error in a high-stakes Divisional bout. \nTalib was justifiably fired up, but every NFL player screws up once in a while. Norwood was already kicking himself, and likely didn't need one of his teammates to add insult to injury. \nPerhaps Talib's frustration is symptomatic of a reported \"rift\" that's taking place inside the Broncos locker room, between the defense and the offense. The defense has carried this team for most of the season, and it's apparently wearing thin on them. \nNorwood's muffed punt was technically a special teams gaffe, but nevertheless, Talib and the defense were frustrated. It's one thing to be emotional. But the concern is that where there's smoke, there's fire. \nHead Coach Gary Kubiak commented on the Talib-Norwood incident via the Denver Post. \n“Let me just say this: We compete at the highest level, and our guys compete all the time — practice, game, those type of things,” Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Monday . “I see guys competing, guys are upset. Jordan and Aqib are fine, I can tell you that. That’s not an issue. Obviously emotions get in the way and those are things we got to talk about and stuff and control our emotions. But it’s a very competitive environment down there and there was no harm intended, I can tell you that. Those guys are fine and we’ll continue to compete.” \nIt was a very tough loss and one that the Broncos can only hope to learn from. However, if there truly is a rift growing inside the locker room, that does not portend well for a strong, unified Broncos team heading down the stretch. \nChad Jensen is the Publisher of Mile High Huddle.

    "text": "0 \nE-40’s Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil Vol. 2 single “ Function” earned gold status earlier this month. The YG , IAMSU! and Problem -assisted banger has also inspired the moniker of a monthly Hip Hop experience in Mexico City. \n“The whole goal of ‘Function’ is to really provide a place for rap fans here in Mexico City to come hang out and bridge the gap between the underground Hip Hop scene here and what I know back in the U.S.,” explained Houston’s own Fat Tony to DX in a recent phone conversation. \nAccording to the RABDARGAB rapper, the idea came after performing at last year’s NRMAL Music Festival taking place in the largest metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere. Coming back to the city this past February, he linked up with local promoters who were really into Hip Hop but who lacked the outlet to reach out to more artists. \n“I could tell that Hip Hop wasn’t as popular in this city as it was in the U.S., but the people that I met who were into it were deeply into it,” he said. \nBeing a fan of the League Of Starz-produced E-40 single, Fat Tony felt the title perfectly applied to his ambition. \n“Honestly, I love that song,” he said. “It’s a good way to describe the party and it alludes to the fact that people are jumping around and having fun. Not just standing around and watching, everyone is as involved in it as the performer.” \nThe structure for “Function” is simple. \nEvery show features an international artist plus a local Mexican artist. Meanwhile, Fat Tony serves as the resident DJ and handles administrative duties. Giving suggestions for some of his favorite emcees from the area, he named Yoga Fire and El Aleman. \n“It’s really not about me as an artist but, it’s about me as a curator and DJ,” he explained. “I’m the one who hand picks all the talent to perform and I’m the one that found the budget, sponsors and set everything up on the administrative side. I promote it along with the venue and sponsors I have on board.” \nFat Tony also hopes his events will broaden the rap taste for fans of Hip Hop within the city who are more into pure East Coast sounds. \n“One thing that I noticed about rap fans out there earlier on is that a lot of Hip Hop fans here were closed minded as they were only into East Coast 90s boom bap and other styles of rap was foreign to them,” he explained. “One major thing that I wanted to accomplish with my parties was to let them know that Hip Hop is a diverse and complicated genre full of nuances and you can’t limit it to one sound. I play Gucci Mane and Gang Starr . I’ll play Lil B and Three 6 Mafia . I’ll play Common and Outkast.” \nUnfortunately, Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency may dismantle progress he’s made in Mexico City. Fat Tony calls the idea of building a large wall on the Mexican border “totally bullshit.” \n“I had a thought that this might be some of the last times for the next couple of years that Mexican rap fans get to see American artists and vice-versa,” he continued. “It’s been on my mind the entire time and it’s really motivated me to go harder with this knowing that there is a real chance it’ll be more difficult to do this next year. I would be completely embarrassed if the United States did that to Mexico.” \nWhile Fat Tony attempts to establish Mexico City as Hip Hop’s next international hub, he’s also continuing his own output of musical content. Releasing “Legal Weed” the day after the presidential election, he joined producer Kyle Mabson as duo Charge It To The Game. Though the two dropped the Urban Hall of Fame EP earlier this year, they also have plans for a full-length LP in 2017. A solo album from him is due around that time as well.  ",

Fans left confused by 'baby' announcement November 23, 2016 by Ainhoa Barcelona Adele left fans confused during her world tour, telling the audience she was off to \"have a baby\" Leave a comment \nAdele left fans confused as she wrapped up the US leg of her world tour, telling the crowd she was off to \"have a baby\". The Hello singer thanked her band and the audience who had come out to support her in Phoenix, Arizona saying: \"Give it up for my band! Give it up for me! I did it! I'll see you on the other side. In a couple of years, I'll be back, and you won't be able to get rid of me.\" \nBefore leaving the stage, the 28-year-old was then heard saying she was going to \"have a baby\". The moment was captured by a fan on Twitter, leading other social media followers to comment on Adele's 'baby' news. Take me down, I'm going to having another baby. đ­â¤đź pic.twitter.com/s499qwnYp3 — MUMMY YOU DID IT!! â¤ (@QueenAdeleblue) November 22, 2016 Adele was heard saying that she was going to \"have a baby\" \n\"Does Adele mean \"I'm pregnant\" or \"I want a few years off again and I want another baby\" I need to know,\" tweeted one fan. \"So did you actually say you're gonna have another baby?? If so; Congrats! If not: sorry, forget I even mentioned it...\" asked another. \nAdele, who already has a four-year-old son Angelo with her partner Simon Konecki, has not commented on the news on her social media feeds. She has, however, revealed that she will be performing in London on two nights in June and July 2017, which has led others to believe that she is not expecting her second baby. The Tottenham-born singer also has to complete dates in Australia and New Zealand next spring, before her live tour officially ends in March. VIEW GALLERY She has just wrapped up the US leg of her world tour \nAdele's little boy was excited to welcome his mum home for the Christmas period. Sharing a photo on Instagram, the singer showed off a handmade banner that her son had painted, which read: \"Mummy you did it!!\" \n\"I just finished my 107 shows in 10 months. 100% live every night. I bloody smashed it, even if I do say so myself. You lot have been incredible, every night you've been so beautiful, loving and engaged,\" Adele wrote. \"My band and my crew you made the whole thing turn. And my beautiful family made it easy for me to do. Big love x.\" VIEW GALLERY Adele has confirmed London dates for next summer \nThe Grammy winner has previously admitted that she is \"too scared\" to have a second baby after suffering postpartum depression with Angelo. \"I felt very inadequate; I felt like I'd made the worst decision of my life… It came in many different forms,\" she told Vanity Fair . \n\"Eventually I just said, I'm going to give myself an afternoon a week, just to do whatever I want without my baby. A friend of mine said, 'Really? Don't you feel bad?' I said, 'I do, but not as bad as I'd feel if I didn't do it.'\" She added: \"I love my son more than anything, but on a daily basis, if I have a minute or two, I wish I could do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Every single day I feel like that.\"",

Media: brian.rogers@chron.com / The Houston Chronicle \nA Texas middle school teacher who was impregnated by a 13-year-old student could face up to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child. \nAlexandria Vera, who was arrested in June, told police that she fell in love with one of her students after the two began a relationship through Instagram messages. The 24-year-old former eighth-grade English teacher at Stovall Middle School in Houston also said that the boy's family was supportive of the affair. \nVera, who pleaded guilty on Wednesday, was initially charged with continuous sexual assault of a child, which carries a maximum punishment of life in prison. By pleading guilty to a lesser charge, her sentence was capped at 30 years, according to the Houston Chronicle. \nShe also is eligible for deferred adjudication, in which case she will be placed on probation and will have no felony on her record if she successfully completes the terms, the Houston Chronicle reported. \n\"We're very much hoping for deferred adjudication,\" Vera's attorney, Ricardo Rodriguez, said, according to the Houston Chronicle.

She said she initially resisted the boy's advances until sometime last fall, when she agreed to hang out with her student. \nProsecutors say Vera and the teen had sex almost every day for nine months. She told investigators that they love each other, according to court documents. During the relationship, Vera told her neighbors that the boy was her brother, according to KHOU, a CBS affiliate. \nThe boy's parents had known of the relationship since October of last year, and they accepted it, Vera told police. \nA police investigation began earlier this year after the school principal received a tip about Vera. She told police that she had gotten pregnant and had an abortion after Child Protective Services questioned her about the relationship in February, according to KTRK-TV, an ABC affiliate. \nVera has been free on a $100,000 bail and has been wearing a GPS ankle monitor. She's scheduled for a sentencing hearing in January. \nThe now-14-year-old boy, who also admitted to the sexual relationship, is in foster care and will remain there at least until August, according to KHOU. The boy's mother also was investigated by Child Protective Services, according to media reports. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

    "text": "\n. At least we finally got to play its broken, confusing battle system. Final Fantasy 15 \nTen years we waited for Final Fantasy 15. Ten years of rumors, speculation, and obsession over brief trailers for a game that started as a PlayStation 3 exclusive named Final Fantasy Versus 13. When it finally re-emerged as Final Fantasy 15 at E3 2013, we saw a trailer depicting a stunning fantasy world mixing hypermodern urban life with fantastic depictions of wildlife and magic. All of that culminated in this cover, a discarded poster for a male beauty pageant hosted by a Nick Lachey-less 98 Degrees and sponsored by L’Oreal. Where is the blonde guy even going? Everyone has to order you online, Final Fantasy 15, because they’ll be mortified buying you at a store. Final Fantasy 9 \nIn terms of cast lovability, Final Fantasy 9 ranks high in the series pantheon. There isn’t a dud among them. Zidane’s a classic lead, Vivi is the first personality behind the iconic black mage design, and Freya is almost Jim Hensonian in her warm mix of animal and human characteristics. Lumping them all together like this on the cover, though, captures none of the whimsy in their adventure. They look like a brochure for an online college where cosplay is a major. Sign up today and you too can learn to make Amarant wigs! Final Fantasy 8 \nAnother example of how Final Fantasy would have been better served by sticking to its original cover art. Final Fantasy 8 is a very, very strange story about a witch from the future trying to take over the world by compressing the past and the future into a single time. And teenagers falling in love. Right. Chew on that. , we get an 8th grader’s attempt at sexy stoicism. Ease down on the lavender and we’ll all get through this, kid. Final Fantasy 14 \nThings are starting to improve, but not by much with Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn. (We’re going with A Realm Reborn rather than the original Final Fantasy 14 because, much like Square-Enix and its shareholders, we’re trying to forget it ever happened.) On the bright side, the Final Fantasy Judge is a remarkable piece of character design which is striking on its own even if it doesn’t evoke the broad swath of experiences in this MMO. On the other side, Cool Guy With Sword is a pretty generic video game cover theme. Final Fantasy 11 \nThe original Final Fantasy MMO definitely did a better job at capturing the spirit of the series. The plain white background with concept artist Yoshitaka Amano’s logo depicting a united, ephemeral band of adventurers is stirring. The bizarre amalgam of cutscene screenshots and logos beneath it undercut any sense of budding majesty, though. All these years later, the cover is as much a monument to hilariously named internet services like PlayOnline as it as a work of art. Final Fantasy 5 \nNow we come to the good stuff. Final Fantasy 5, another early entry that waited until the Game Boy Advance to come west, benefits from a cover that’s far more romantic than the game itself. This is, after all, a game about a guy named Buttz whose best friend is a giant chicken and your mission is to fight random battle after random battle so he can slowly learn barely distinguishable jobs. Amano’s delicate characters on the cover, though, hint at a wispy world where even dudes named Buttz can be heartthrobs. Final Fantasy 3 \nWhat Final Fantasy 2 got so wrong, Final Fantasy 3 gets very right. Plain, graceful, and breathtaking, the Final Fantasy 3 cover for Nintendo DS is nearly perfect. The gorgeous logo captures how basic the game itself is. The original version on NES marked the first appearance of the Job System, where you train up characters in different vocations that can change as you go. That’s pretty much all there is to it. From a story perspective, it’s even straightforward good-versus-evil stuff than the first game. Beautiful and simple. Final Fantasy \nWhen Final Fantasy came out in 1990, the world still hadn’t gotten on board with JRPGs. Role-playing adventures were still largely stuck in 1970s Dungeons and Dragons mode, which is no bad thing. Everyone likes burly men and women wearing fur thongs in muddy landscapes. This cover graces up against that sort of Monster Guide territory with its big medieval weapons and crystal balls thing, but there’s a subtle quality to it that still feels distinctly Final Fantasy. It remains iconic even as the series’ more gossamer characteristics have come to the fore. Final Fantasy 12 \nOne of the primary criticisms leveled against Final Fantasy 12 by haters is that “it’s just weird Star Wars.” Is it really a criticism when the game clearly knows that it’s just riffing on the plot of the 1977 space opera? Even the cover apes the classic movie posters of Drew Struzan, combining the game’s cast and its ethereal world design into a pyramid like collage of romantic imagery. In the same way Sturzan arranged George Lucas characters to maximum effect, Final Fantasy 12’s cover pulls you into its Star Wars But Super Manga Sexy world. Just look at that sepia toned Balthier and Fran and tell me you don’t want to know about the hottest version of Han Solo and Chewbacca ever. Final Fantasy 7 \nWith the exception of the occasionally mangled English script, Square got everything right about Final Fantasy 7’s release in the West. Decades later, it’s still the nucleus of RPG fandom around the world because of its batshit story, iconic characters, amazing music, and sumptuous art. The American cover is arguably the best version, a ghostly but still vivid rendering of Cloud Strife as he stares up at the Shinra mako reactor, a classical depiction of resistance against corrupted power. It nails both the game’s nature as a technological showcase and as an environmentally conscious science fiction romance. Final Fantasy 4 \nThe first time around in the West, Final Fantasy 4 was called Final Fantasy 2, its difficulty was halved, and most of its characters lost their specialized abilities in an attempt to make the game more accessible. It also got a cover that was ust a logo against an angry red background . Not bad, but it doesn’t exactly embody a story where the hero has to literally fight the evil in his soul before flying a dwarven spaceship to the freaking moon. Many years later, Final Fantasy 4 made it to the US in an unedited, expanded form called Final Fantasy 4 Advance and it brought with it not just the sketched figure work of Yoshitaka Amano but a full, brand new painting. The thick color, angular bodies, and otherworldly faces capture everything about Final Fantasy 4 that’s kept people playing it for a quarter of a century. Final Fantasy 6 \nSo that Final Fantasy 3 SNES art we linked to above is pretty terrible. Our own Connor Sheridan described it as the crappy art on the side of a county fair haunted house. When it returned to the West appropriately named Final Fantasy 6 as part of the Final Fantasy Anthology, that mistake was remedied, and how. While Yoshitaka Amano’s logos and characters have appeared on other covers, Final Fantasy 6 marks the first time that one of his concept art landscapes made it to the cover as well. This portrait of Terra atop her Magitek armor before one of the game’s impossible cities actually manages to encapsulate everything Final Fantasy is at its best, an expert blend of sci-fi, fantasy, romance, and something wholly unique and strange that belongs just to this series. It’s sexy and strong, familiar and distant, all at the same time.

    "text": "Saskatchewan's universities are figuring out how to handle a budget cut with just a few months left in their fiscal years.\nThe province released its mid-year financial update Tuesday, and with it came $11.7 million of cuts to the Ministry of Advanced Education.\nSask. now projects $1B deficit for 2016-17 \nThe cuts include $9.3 million of reduced grants to post-secondary institutions, $1.5 million of money not yet allocated for preventative maintenance and renewal funding, $400,000 to post-secondary projects and $500,000 in administrative costs.\nAs for the institutions themselves, the University of Saskatchewan will see reductions of $5 million, the University of Regina will see $1.7 million, Saskatchewan Polytechnic faces $1.8 million and all other institutions will see $800,000.\nU of R to look for more savings University of Regina President and Vice-Chancellor Vianne Timmons said while they understand the financial situation the province is currently in, facing a cut now is especially challenging.\n\"To get the cut and absorb it within three months of an academic year, that's all we have left. It's going to be tough.\"\nThe university faces a $1.1-million reduction to its operating budget, a $300,000 clawback of a Workers' Compensation Board surplus rebate and a $275,000 cut to preventative maintenance.\nTimmons said the U of R hasn't received sufficient funding to balance its budget in the last few years. Increased enrolments helped the university absorb cuts last year, but Timmons said that likely won't happen this time.\n\"Every year we've gone in, looking for efficiencies and areas we can cut, and this will be another one.\"\nIf savings can't be found, Timmons said the university may have to go to its campuses to claw back funding.\nTimmons said the overall goal will be to make sure there is minimal impact to students, staff and faculty due to the cuts.\nU of S to draw from reserves At the University of Saskatchewan, the $5 million reduction is one that Michael Atkinson said can be absorbed out of the institution's reserves.\n\"This is why we have some reserves, to avoid that kind of forced deficit situation,\" said the interim provost and vice-president of academics.\nThe university faces a $3.1-million reduction to its operating budget, a $1.2-million clawback of a Workers' Compensation Board surplus rebate and a $720,000 cut to preventative maintenance.\nAtkinson also acknowledged the difficult situation the province is in financially, but he said he doesn't think universities will suffer down the road.\n\"There would be a concern if this was a long-term cut to the institution. But as we understand it, this is a one-time reduction in our budget for the fiscal year.\"",

    "text": "Why. Photo: WB \nI have a lot of problems with the television series you all know and love as Gilmore Girls . Lorelai and Rory are the actual worst . No one on this planet has ever spoken like Jess Mariano. Emily Gilmore is a queen and no one treats her as such. But perhaps my biggest issue with this show is the glaring eyesore of the title. Why on earth is that second \"g\" lowercase? Who was possessed to make such a structural error? Now, I never watched the show back in its original run, so I don’t have the same affection for the series as many my age do. And every damn time I watch this show it’s the first thing I think about, and I can’t shake the annoyance. To get to the bottom of this I did some significant research (read: Googling) and all I could find was this very short Reddit thread . So in lieu of an actual investigation, here are my best guesses at why the show chose this maddening grammatical faux pas for its title. \nTo represent the mother-daughter relationship. \nBig G, little G, big Lorelai, little Lorelai. The show is ostensibly about the power of love between a mother and daughter, but I think the series is really about a Connecticut grand dame who can’t get anyone to appreciate her dinner parties. This is the most obvious reason, but I think there’s another answer.\nTo illustrate the quirkiness of Stars Hollow. \nA pancake house that doesn’t sell pancakes. “Annual” traditions that only appear once over the course of seven years. A gazebo. This town is so wacky! Only a title so annoyingly incorrect would do for a town as ~unconventional~ as our dear setting.\nThe WB was trying to be hip. \nIn an effort to capture the elusive teen audience, the network tried speaking in AOL chat jargon. The original titled was actually GiLmOrE gIrLz.\nThe G’s growth was stunted from too much caffeine. \nFive cups a day really does affect your health.\nKirk was in charge of the title design and he forget to hit caps lock. \nJust like the forgotten Easter egg map before it, naming the show was a task Kirk was just not up for.\nThere was a budget issue. \nThe show spent so much money on the rights to Carole King’s seminal “Where You Lead” that there was no money left for a second capital G.\nHollywood’s oppressive gender wage gap. \nA much younger G was brought in to play alongside the veteran capital G to add some moxie. \nThe second capital G got lost trying to escape one of Amy Sherman-Palladino’s hats . \nThey are cavernous.\nThe first G requested she be the only capital in her contract. \nA notorious diva.",

RUGABER, The Associated Press 1:02 p.m. EST November 27, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump speaks during his meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Trump promised big tax cuts for the middle class, but for nearly 8 million families, the opposite would occur: They’d pay more. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) \nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump's proposals would modestly cut income taxes for most middle-class Americans. But for nearly 8 million families — including a majority of single-parent households — the opposite would occur: They'd pay more. \nMost married couples with three or more children would also pay higher taxes, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found. And while middle-class families as a whole would receive tax cuts of about 2 percent, they'd be dwarfed by the windfalls averaging 13.5 percent for America's richest 1 percent. \nTrump's campaign rhetoric had promoted the benefits of his proposals for middle-income Americans. \n\"The largest tax reductions are for the middle class,\" said Trump's \"Contract With the American Voter,\" released last month. \nThe tax hikes that would hit single parents and large families would result from Trump's plan to eliminate the personal exemption and the head-of-household filing status. These features of the tax code have enabled many Americans to reduce their taxable income. \nHis other proposed tax changes would benefit middle- and lower-income Americans. But they wouldn't be enough to offset those modifications. \n\"If you're a low- or moderate-income single parent, you're going to get hurt,\" said Bob Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. \nUnlike Trump's polarizing proposals on immigration and trade, his tax plan is in line with traditional Republican policy. His steep tax cuts in many ways resemble those carried out by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, and the Republican-run Congress is expected to welcome them. \nDuring the campaign, Trump said his tax cuts — for individuals and companies — would energize the economy by boosting business investment in factories and equipment, while leaving consumers with more cash to spend. His proposals, he contended, would help create 25 million jobs over the next decade. \nBut Lily Batchelder, a visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center and former deputy director of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, estimates that roughly 7.9 million families with children would pay higher taxes under his proposals. About 5.8 million are led by single parents. An additional 2.1 million are married couples. \nOther analysts, including economists at the conservative Tax Foundation and right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, have agreed with Batchelder's conclusions. \nHere's what her analysis finds: \nRight now, a single parent with $75,000 in income and two children can claim a head of household deduction of $9,300, plus three personal exemptions. Those steps would reduce the household's taxable income by $21,450, to $53,550. \nTrump's plan would more than double the standard deduction to $15,000. But that change would be outweighed by his elimination of personal exemptions and head-of-household status. So the family's taxable income would be $60,000, and their tax bill would be $2,440 more than it is now. \nA married couple with four children and income of $50,000 would absorb a tax increase of $1,090 because of their loss of personal exemptions. \nKelly Rodriguez, 47, who lives in Tampa, Florida, voted for Trump and is a single mother who claims two of her four children as dependents. (Her ex-husband claims the other two.) She made roughly $90,000 last year, including alimony payments. Her taxes would likely rise under Trump's plan, according to Batchelder's analysis. \n\"I would want him to explain that to me,\" she said. \"Taxes have to make sense to the people paying them.\" \nStill, Trump's plan will likely evolve during congressional negotiations before it becomes law. \n\"This is not anywhere close to a final plan,\" Williams said. \nKyle Pomerlau, director of federal projects at the conservative Tax Foundation, noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan's own tax-cut proposal is similar to Trump's but wouldn't raise taxes on single-parent families. In theory, the two plans could be melded, and Trump's elimination of the head of household status could be dropped. \nBut leaving the head of household filing status and personal exemptions intact would lower tax revenue by $2.1 trillion over the next decade, the Tax Policy Center says. \nTrump's advisers deny that he will raise taxes on middle-income Americans but don't provide details. Previously, the campaign suggested that Trump would broadly instruct Congress to avoid raising taxes on lower- and middle-income workers. \n\"We will cut taxes massively for the middle class and working class and protect everyone in the middle class and working class,\" Stephen Miller, Trump's top policy adviser, said in an email. \nYet all independent analyses show most of the benefit flowing to the wealthiest Americans. Nearly half of Trump's tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of earners, the Tax Policy Center found. Less than a quarter of the cuts would benefit the bottom 80 percent. \nTrump proposes to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. That would slash the top rate from the current 39.6 percent. He would repeal the estate tax, which affects only about 0.2 percent of estates — those worth above $5.45 million. \nFor middle-income earners as a whole, the Trump proposals would cut taxes, even taking into account the increases on single-parent families. Those earning nearly $50,000 to about $83,000 — the middle one-fifth — would receive an average cut of $1,010, according to the Tax Policy Center. That would lift their after-tax incomes 1.8 percent. \nBy contrast, the wealthiest 1 percent — those earning over $700,000 — would enjoy a tax cut averaging nearly $215,000, boosting their after-tax incomes 13.5 percent. And the richest 0.1 percent — those making above $3.7 million — would receive a bonanza: An average tax cut exceeding $1 million. \n\"Trump's campaign rhetoric may have been populist, but his tax plan isn't,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the policy center, wrote on its website. \nHis tax proposals suggest what may be a challenge for Trump's administration: Providing his middle- and working-class supporters with tangible signs of economic progress. Middle-income Americans already pay a relatively modest share of federal income taxes compared with the wealthy. That limits the scope of what tax cuts could do for them. \n\"The thing that he needs to worry about is making life better for his supporters, and that involves more than tax cuts,\" Williams said. \nMiddle class finances have also been squeezed by high and rising costs for health care, higher education and housing, noted Joseph Cohen, a sociologist at Queens College in New York City. \n\"We've been cutting taxes since Reagan, and things have been getting worse for the middle class since Reagan,\" he said.

X What is this? \nSponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nSaskatoon parents now have another option when it comes to their child’s education. For the first time ever in Saskatchewan, an elementary Montessori program is being operated by a school division. \nUnfamiliar with Montessori? It’s taught in thousands of classrooms around the world and this method is learning is all about freedom within limits. Saskatoon Public Schools plan to hire more French immersion teachers \n“Our students aren’t grouped in classes Grade 1, Grade 2 – they’re grouped in groupings of Grade 1, 2, 3 together so that children learn from one another,” Brent Hills, superintendent of education for Saskatoon Public Schools , said. \n“Children then have an opportunity to experience their learning as they’re ready for it as opposed to when the teacher is deciding this is now the time to learn.” \nREAD MORE: Saskatoon school boards experience rapid student growth \nThe classroom at City Park School that Global News visited didn’t have a desk for the teacher and each student quietly engaged in a different activity during what was noted on the whiteboard as “work cycle.” \n“Things are not divided up into subject areas. It’s not like the bell rings at 10 o’clock and everyone switches to math,” Dr. Grace Thomson, head of the School for Maria Montessori Preschool and Kindergarten, said. \n“They don’t have to do it at the same time so when you go into a Montessori classroom not only are the children multi-aged in there, you will also see them working at different things.” \nREAD MORE: Saskatoon Board of Education decides on names for new elementary schools \nWhile the Montessori program isn’t new to the province, a program being operated by a school division is. \n“There’s not a one size fits all for education for everybody and as a public education system we value that,” Hills said. \nSo in this specific case in Saskatoon, much of the programming is free as opposed to tuition-based. \n“It’s public education so it’s funded no differently than another special program or unique program in Saskatoon so our students in Grade 1 to Grade 8 don’t pay tuition.” \nREAD MORE: Saskatoon schools hope to train more teachers in treaty education \nMontessori tuition rates vary from institution to institution but parents in North America typically shell out any where from $1,000 to $14,000 a year. \nAt City Park School, tuition still applies to children in the early learning program aged two to five years old which is independently operated. \nOtherwise families with children in this newly integrated program are only on the hook for a small fee for resources and getting their child to and from school. \nAt this point, there isn’t a wait list for students but growing interest from parents who are considering the option next year. \n“It’s not about competition, it’s just about providing the opportunity for all families in Saskatoon to have a Montessori education if they choose to do so,” Hills said. \nThe success of the program will be reviewed and whether or not Montessori is integrated into other public schools in the district, that decision will be up to the board. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

    "text": "Benfica score against Besiktas after hitting woodwork three times Published 24/7 \nBesiktas came from three goals down to draw 3-3 with Benfica in an enthralling Champions League encounter on Wednesday. \nIt didn’t reach the level of Borussia Dortmund 8-4 win against Legia Warsaw the previous day - it’ll be a long time before another game does - but it provided enormous entertainment nonetheless. \nBenfica looked to have booked their place in the knockout round after scoring three goals in the first half but the Besiktas side bounced back in a game reminiscent of the 2005 Champions League final between Liverpool and AC Milan. Article continues below \nCenk Tosun reduced the deficit in the 58th minute but Besiktas had to wait until the 83rd minute to score again, Ricardo Quaresma scoring from the penalty spot. \nThe comeback was complete when Quaresma sent in a brilliant rabona cross that was turned in by Vincent Aboubakar in the 89th minute. Article continues below Cristiano Ronaldo awarded incredible new FIFA 17 card after Atletico hat-trick \nBesiktas must have thought it was just not their day when Ljubomir Fejsa scored Benfica’s third goal in bizarre circumstances. \nThe midfielder steered the ball home after his teammates struck the woodwork not once, not twice but three times. \nIn Benfica’s case, it was fourth time lucky. \nWatch the goal below. \nThe Portuguese outfit’s side luck ran out in the second half when they completely capitulated. Hamann: Nobody gave Liverpool a chance \nDidi Hamann, who was a part of the Liverpool team that beat Milan on penalties after recovering a 3-0 half-time deficit, was instantly reminded of that night in Istanbul. \n\"They were probably given as much chance as people had given us 11 years ago,\" Hamann told RTE, via Goal . \n\"But what a remarkable comeback. It started with an absolute screamer of a goal. Tosun with a great bicycle kick, then Quaresma with a penalty, and then look at that rabona! What a cross, he puts it in on a sixpence to Aboubakar, and he finishes off.” Quaresma's assist \nHamann certainly isn’t underselling Quaresma’s assist. Check it out below. Group B is finely poised \nThe result, couple with Napoli’s 0-0 draw against Dynamo Kiev, leaves Group B finely poised. Benfica and Napoli lead the way on eight points each but they take each other on in the final group game. Besiktas, on seven points, will fancy their chances of beating bottom-placed Kiev and reaching the last-16. \n\"At half-time they're nearly down and out because you're expecting Napoli to beat Kiev, but now they're right back in it,” Hamann added. “It's in their hands now. It would be a remarkable achievement after the first-half.\" What's the craziest goal you've seen? Let us know in the comments section below! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

    "text": "By: Marc Jayson Cayabyab - Reporter / @MJcayabyabINQ INQUIRER.net / 01:52   \nWhat should have been a serious inquiry in aid of legislation at the House of Representatives over the alleged drug trade veered into a jeering match on star witness Ronnie Dayan, the alleged bagman and lover of besieged senator Leila de Lima. \nAs Dayan read out his affidavit during Thursday’s hearing, the audience, lawmakers and police jeered as Dayan recounted his breakup with De Lima due to another alleged boyfriend “Warren.” \nPhilippine National Police (PNP) Director General Roland “Bato” Dela Rosa was noticeably flushed with laughter, scratching his bald head and slapping his palm on his face as the crowd jeered at Dayan. ADVERTISEMENT \nReactions of “Aaaw” and “Ayiiii” reverberated in the room as Dayan told the story of how his affair with De Lima developed in 2007 until their breakup in 2015. \nMajority leader Ilocos Norte Rep. Rudy Fariñas added fuel to the fire when he asked Dayan to describe the level of his passion during the relationship with De Lima. \nAs Dayan recounted the times he received alleged kickbacks from alleged Eastern Visayas drug lord Kerwin Espinosa for De Lima, Fariñas took the opportunity to pander on the details of the affair. \n“Nung panahong yan, malakas pa pag-iibigan niyo o humina na?” Fariñas said. \n“Medyo signal number one na po sir,” Dayan responded, to the jeers of the audience. READ: Dayan recounts ‘breakup’ with De Lima \nFariñas then asked the extent of their relationship, to which Dayan said his passion for De Lima reached up to “signal number five.” \n“Umabot din siguro ng signal number five, sir,” Dayan said, during which Dela Rosa slumped to his seat laughing with his palms on his face. \nDeputy speaker Capiz Rep. Fredenil Castro was next in the interpellation and took from Fariñas’ line of questioning on digging into details of Dayan and De Lima’s affair. \n“Ginoong Dayan, sa inyong relasyon ni Senador, masasabi mo bang ang iyong pag-ibig ay dalisay?” Castro said. \nEliciting guffaws from the audience, Dayan answered: “Ang pag-ibig ko na tapat ay di isinukli.” \nWhen Castro asked him if he would be willing to let go of his love for De Lima, Dayan said: “Alang alang sa batas, sa katotohanan, kaya ko siyang ipagkanulo.” \nAsked why he acted as bagman for De Lima despite knowing that he was dealing with an alleged drug lord (Espinosa), Dayan said” “Nagawa ko po yan dahil sa pagmamahal ko sa kaniya.” \nCastro finished his interpellation when he asked Dayan if the latter transacted for De Lima in exchange for “init ng katawan,” to which Dayan reluctantly said no. \n“Hindi ko alam na delikado makipagkita kay Kerwin,” Dayan said. \nDayan had admitted delivering money from Espinosa to De Lima amid their romantic relationship. \nDayan has said he gave drug money from Espinosa for De Lima at least five times in 2014. Espinosa however said he gave De Lima at least P8 million in 2015 for the justice secretary’s senatorial campaign. \nDayan was arrested in La Union 11:30 a.m. Tuesday after he was cited in contempt for snubbing the House of Representatives inquiry in aid of legislation on the proliferation of drugs at the New Bilibid Prison implicating De Lima.

    "text": "\nto receive USC News via email subscribe Social Impact Architecture students design houses for L.A.’s homeless Trojans apply their skills to social ills, designing prototypes for temporary shelters that could work in the real world BY Joanna Clay November 29, 2016 \nWhen architecture student Jayson Champlain set out to build his first house, he didn’t go to vendors or Home Depot. \nHe went to Vernon — scavenging items outside warehouses and in the garbage. \n“One of the things we wanted to find was … an old truck camper shell,” Champlain said. “Luckily, we found one by the train tracks in Vernon, flipped up on the side of the road.” \nThe tiny house — with the shell for a roof — was built in the Madworkshop Homeless Studio at the USC School of Architecture. \nIn just a few months, a class of 11 fourth-year students came up with designs and prototypes for temporary homeless housing — from do-it-yourself nomadic designs, such as a bed that folds out of a shopping cart to tiny homes built with scavenged goods to a 92-square-foot prefabricated unit with built-in furniture. \nAnd they could see their work in the real world. \nMost recently, the class has been working with the city of Los Angeles and the nonprofit Hope of the Valley to create the prefabricated units for a 30-bed senior women’s shelter in the San Fernando Valley — a region that’s seen a 35 percent increase in homelessness in the last 12 months, said Hope of the Valley CEO Ken Craft. \n“We’re getting firsthand experience showing that architecture isn’t just for those who can afford it,” said Aleksandr Drabovskiy, “that it can be something that creates social good and changes the way people live their lives.” Funding found \nThe course was funded by a grant from Santa Monica-based Madworkshop, a design education nonprofit. Professors Sofia Borges and Scott Mitchell are director and board member at the organization, respectively. About the faculty Sofia Borges \nBesides being a professor at USC, she’s an architecture writer and editor, publishing numerous book titles for publisher Gestalten. This year, she exhibited a photography project at USC called “(Home)less.” Dedicated to her brother, she laid images of structures over photos of homeless living on the streets, highlighting how the “power of environment shapes how others see us.” Scott Mitchell \nHe is known for his experience in fabrication as well as design. He’s worked for Trojan Frank Gehry and is the owner of Los Angeles-based design-build company Gigante AG. \nThe course wanted to address the issue of temporary housing — the gap between living on the streets and living in permanent supportive housing. \n“It can take two years to get in permanent housing,” Mitchell said. “We’re trying to get people off the street immediately.” \nThe workshop not only got the students thinking about applying their skills to social ills — but, for the majority, it was their first time building anything. \n“They’re master builders now,” Borges said with a laugh. A trio of projects \nThe workshop was broken up into three projects. There were mobile shelters made for street living, such as the shopping cart model or carts that fold out with beds and desks. Then there were the tiny houses, which they built in a week using scavenged materials they found all over Los Angeles — incorporating everything from refrigerators to screen doors. Both got them thinking of the needs of the homeless. \nLastly were the prefabricated units, which are intended to be easily mass-produced and transportable by truck and used on under-utilized land in Los Angeles, such as land that is yet to be developed. There would be an agreement, like a land lease, and then the units could be moved to a new location when development starts. \n“It’s wonderful because it utilizes empty vacant land that otherwise is just sitting there,” Craft said. “Why not come up with a creative solution so that human beings have a place to sleep?” On the rise \nHomelessness has increased across Los Angeles County, but shelters are limited. For this reason, the county estimates 70 percent of the homeless are unsheltered, meaning they sleep on the streets or in tents. \nIn the San Fernando Valley alone, there are roughly 5,000 homeless people with only 900 beds to sleep in, Craft said. \nThe city of Los Angeles doesn’t require a conditional use permit for shelters of 30 beds or less, eliminating the need for community hearings, which means the shelter concept could be easily replicated and quickly, Mitchell said. The units would be pre-certified by the city. \nThe students have taken the reigns, scouting for land for the Valley shelter, finding a spot in Canoga Park. Right now, the nonprofit is looking to raise funds to negotiate the land lease and build the units, which Borges estimates would cost around $25,000 each. \nFor Borges, leading this class is a source of pride. Her brother, Daren, was homeless in Northern California, living off and on the streets for roughly 20 years. He died a couple years ago at the age of 42. \nShe hopes students realize their potential to help society with their work. \n“With doctors, you take an oath to help everyone and I think as architects we should take a similar pledge,” Borges said. “We have the ability to create housing, create shelter — typically we do that for the most fortunate among us, rather than the least.” \nOn Dec. 7, the class is presenting a prototype of the units they propose for Hope of the Valley. They invited Midnight Mission, Downtown Women’s Center, Skid Row Housing Trust and the city’s Department of Building and Safety with the hope that one day, the units can be all over Los Angeles.

    "text": "Follow @ZeeNews \nZee Media Bureau \nMumbai: Credai, the realtor's body, on Saturday said that housing prices unlikely to come down in primary market post demonetisation since rates are already at the lowest level. \nCredai , however, supported the decision of note ban and said that the decision will help in eliminating black money, corruption, fake currency and terror financing. \nThe association in a statement said that the primary market is funded by banks and financial institutions which are all regulated entities. As such, cash component is not an integral element of the primary market. \nTherefore, Credai denies adverse impact on the primary real estate market arising out of demonetisation . In fact, the primary segment is expected to gain at a rate of 15 per cent YoY, the statement said. \nThe government's resolve to eliminate black money and corruption is in the interest of the common man as well as business and industry, it said. \nReal estate industry contributes 7 per cent of country's GDP and is the second biggest employer after agriculture. Given the scale and size of the industry, it is imperative that Credai articulates the impact of demonetisation on the industry and brings it to the knowledge of the general public, it said. \nIn the aftermath of demonetisation move, banks are going to have additional funds upward of Rs 10 trillion. Hence, a fall in interest rates up to 200 basis points is expected. \nAn early sign is seen with country's largest lender State Bank of India cutting its deposit rates by 1.75 per cent. \nAccording to Credai, we see home loan rates coming down from the present level of 9.25 per cent to less than 7 per cent in less than one year from now. This would bring down the EMI for the ultimate consumers. \nCredai expects the mop up of black money to also lead to higher tax collection and a lower rate of personal and corporate income tax from the next financial year onwards. In other words, the demonetisation would put more money into the pocket of home purchasers through lower tax burden and incentives for home ownership. \nThe tendency towards lower rate of interest is also going to be strengthened by a low rate of inflation. \nCredai, comprising 11,500 real estate developers spread over 166 cities in 23 states in the country, is the apex body for private real estate developers in the country. \n(PTI inputs) ",

    "text": "Kashmir rights activist Khurram Pervez Even after J&K High Court on Friday termed the detention of human rights activist Khurram Parvez under Public safety Act “not only illegal” but “abuse of power” and ordered J&K Government to release him, Parvez is still in prison. The reason: a minor error in the date of the issue of PSA warrant at one place in the order. Superintendent of Kotbalwal Jail Dinesh Sharma told The Indian Express “there was a minor clerical mistake in the (court) order and we will release him (Parvez) as soon as it is rectified”. Director General of Prisons S K Mishra said he can’t comment because he hasn’t received any order. “As soon as the jail receives the order, they will release (him),” he said. J&K’s Home Secretary Home R K Goel said he will have to check. “I haven’t received any order,” he said.\n“The High Court hasn’t just ordered his release, it has questioned the detention itself,” a close relative of Parvez told The Indian Express. “We have been waiting for his release since Friday when the court order was issued. Today, the jail authorities told us that they cannot release him because there is a minor error in the order”. He said “at one place in the order, the date of the issue of the PSA warrant against him (Parvez) has been put as September 19 instead of September 21”. “The jail authorities called it a minor error but wanted the Home department to disregard this small issue and tell them to release him. That didn’t happen. Now we will have to approach the Court again to issue a fresh order to correct this error,” he said. The PSA warrant was issued on September 21 while this warrant was based on a dossier of the Senior Superintendent Police issued on September 19.\nThe J&K Police had picked up Parvez from his home in Srinagar on September 16, a day after he was disallowed to board a Geneva bound flight at Delhi as he was on his way to attend United Nations Human Rights Council session and was subsequently booked under PSA and imprisoned at Kotbalwal jail in Jammu.\nJustice Muzaffar Hussain Attar while ordering Parvez’s release had said that District Magistrate Srinagar Farooq Ahmad Lone has “arbitrarily” ordered his detention and “nothing is brought into the notice of the Court” to show that “involvement of the detenue (has) surfaced as an accused” in the FIRs mentioned in the grounds of detention. “…he (Detaining Authority) has not been sure whether the activities of the detenue were prejudicial to the security of the State or maintenance of public order and has, thus, arbitrarily, ordered for detention…It also shows that the detention order suffers from lack of application of mind on the part of the Detaining Authority,” the order said. “Though it is the duty of the State and its authorities to maintain peace in the society but it is equally their responsibility to ensure that laws, which they invoke to achieve such purpose, are followed and complied with honestly”.\nReferring to Public Safety Act, Justice Attar had said “a society which has catapulted itself to the highest position of democratic values and principles, may not accept the law like the Act of 1978”. Saying that Parvez’s detention order “is not only illegal but the Detaining Authority has abused its powers in ordering his (Parvez’s) detention, the Court said that “…….perusal of the FIR’s…. show that in none of these FIRs, the detenue (Parvez) has been named as an accused”.\n“Nothing is brought to the notice of the Court, either in the grounds of detention or in the Reply Affadavit, that in the investigation of these FIRs, involvement of the detnue (Parvez) surfaced as an accused,” the Court said.\nThe Court had also raised serious questions about the police case against Parvez that led to his arrest initially, saying that the police witnesses “made parrot-like statements”, gave wrong parentage and address of Parvez and also didn’t provide the content of the slogans that they accused Parvez had instigated people to make. The Court also said that (Detaining Authority) has not been sure whether the activities of the detenue were prejudicial to the security of the State or maintenance of public order,” Justice Muzzafar Hussain Attar said in the order.\n© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

    "text": "The Latest on Deep South severe weather (all times local): 10:15 p.m. Emergency officials in Tennessee say a wildfire has set 30 structures ablaze in Gatlinburg, including a 16-story hotel, and is at the edge of the Dollywood theme park. Tennessee Emergency Management Agency spokesman Dean Flener says in a news release Monday night that mandatory evacuations were underway for areas in and around Gatlinburg, including the south part of Pigeon Forge, where Dolly Parton's theme park is. Flener says strong afternoon winds fanned the wildfire on land in the great Smoky Mountains National Park to move quickly onto private property. TEMA says no deaths have been reported. ——— 7:45 p.m. Officials say several areas are being evacuated because of fires in and around Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Gatlinburg police had been going door to door in one neighborhood asking for voluntary evacuations. But the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that as wind picked up and fallen trees sparked fires from downed lines, Gatlinburg fire officials declared a mandatory evacuation of a larger area. The newspaper said some park employees were also evacuating and some locations closed. A news release from the Gatlinburg Chamber of Commerce said the National Park Service reported more fire growth expected in the park with spot fires possibly forming outside the main area. ——— 6:45 p.m. Roaring winds have been followed by an inch or more of rain across much of Mississippi Monday but not enough to break a months-long drought. National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Carpenter says areas of northeast Louisiana and Mississippi's Delta region got more than an inch, and parts of central and northeast Mississippi were also likely to reach that total. As of last week, more than 70 percent of the state was classified as being in extreme drought. Trees were reported downed in nearly 20 counties across the state, with gusts of more than 50 mph in multiple locations. Power outages peaked at more than 23,000 statewide. Mississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesman Greg Flynn says powerlines downed by winds sparked grass fires in four central Mississippi counties. Though at least one tornado warning was posted, for Noxubee County, Carpenter says no tornadoes were confirmed by early Monday evening. ——— 5:15 p.m. A storm system moving across the South announced itself in Mississippi with hours of wind before heavy rains arrived. Damage was light, but trees were reported down in at least eight counties, including one that fell on the town hall in the 100-resident hamlet of Eden in the state's Delta region. Yazoo County Emergency Management Director Jack Willingham says the metal building is damaged beyond repair, but no one was injured. Photos taken by Willingham show a tree branch plunged through the roof. Statewide, power outages rose to nearly 23,000 by 5 p.m., with the heaviest numbers around Jackson and in Tallahatchie County. Forecasters say a threat of strong wind and possibly an isolated tornado persists through the evening. More than 2 inches of rain fell in some areas. ——— 3:30 p.m. Fire officials say a storm system moving across the South appears to be heading toward many of the largest ongoing wildfires and will help suppress them. However, authorities say the rain moving across parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee on Monday likely won't end the fire threat and dangers posed by the blazes. Several of the largest fires are in Georgia and North Carolina. Dave Martin of the U.S. Forest Service says high winds on the leading edge of the front could topple dead trees and put firefighters in danger. But Martin said the rains will certainly help the overall situation. Forest Service spokesman Adam Rondeau says there are 24 large wildfires now burning throughout the southern U.S., covering about 133,000 acres. ——— 1:30 p.m. More than 14,000 customers are without power in Mississippi as heavy winds accompany rain into the state. Outages are concentrated in central and southeast Mississippi, according to power providers. Entergy Corp., Mississippi's single largest utility, reported 6,800 users without power Monday afternoon, with the largest numbers in Rankin and Hinds counties. Southern Pine Electric Power Association reported 4,500 customers without power, mostly in Copiah, Scott and Smith counties. Sustained winds above 20 mph were being reported at Jackson International Airport and Meridian's Key Field. A gust of 54 mph was reported Monday morning at Clarksdale. ——— 12:35 p.m. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, has issued a tornado watch for western and northern Louisiana. The watch is in effect until 5 p.m. Monday. The weather service says thunderstorms will slowly increase in coverage and intensity through the afternoon and spreading into northwest Louisiana. Forecasters say the storm environment will become more favorable for supercells with the potential to produce a few tornadoes. A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form. ——— 9:05 a.m. Most of the Deep South is under the threat of severe weather through Wednesday. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, says a cold front approaching Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia will bring thunderstorms to the region. The weather service says damaging winds will be the primary threat, with tornadoes also possible. Some storms could produce possibly severe hail. Northern Louisiana and northern Mississippi will see gusty winds of up to 40 mph and brief heavy downpours on Monday. Rainfall amounts will average a quarter to half of an inch, with isolated higher amounts of up to an inch possible. The weather service says the rain water should be soaked up quickly because of severe drought conditions across the Deep South. 0 Shares",

    "text": "9 COMMENTS Breitbart News is asking its readers to boycott Kellogg Co. after the cereal maker said it would no longer advertise on the conservative news website.\nIn a post on Breitbart News on Wednesday, the publication called on readers to sign a #DumpKelloggs petition against the manufacturer, whose brands include Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies and Cheez-It.\nKellogg on Tuesday said it would pull its ads from Breitbart News after consumers notified the manufacturer that its products were appearing on the site. A company spokesperson told the Associated Press , “We regularly work with our media buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren’t aligned with our values as a company.”\nBreitbart fought back hard. “Boycotting Breitbart News for presenting mainstream American ideas is an act of discrimination and intense prejudice,” Alexander Marlow, Breitbart News editor-in-chief, said in the Breitbart News article.\nThe anti-Kellogg petition accused Kellogg of trying to “placate left-wing totalitarians.”\nIn a statement, Kellogg said, “To be clear, our decision had nothing to do with politics.”\nBreitbart News, a hard-right site know for scorched-earth populism, has been popular with the “alt right,” portraying immigration and multiculturalism as threats. The site’s critics say it has explicitly embraced white nationalism.\nThe site’s former chairman, Stephen Bannon, helped run Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and is now poised to become one of the president elect’s top advisers in the White House. Since the election and Mr. Bannon’s appointment, scrutiny of Breitbart has intensified.\nAds appear across the internet thanks to a complex web of third-party services, and brands often do not know where their ads will end up. The Kellogg spokesperson told the AP that “there is a very large volume of websites, so occasionally something is inadvertently missed.”\nLast week, online-advertising company AppNexus said it would stop letting Breitbart News use its ad-serving tools because the site violated the ad tech company’s hate speech terms, Bloomberg reported.\nOther brands, including Allstate, Nest, EarthLink, Warby Parker and SoFi, have also blacklisted Breitbart from showing their ads, Digiday reported.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com",

    "text": "Drag according to your convenience ET NOW RADIO ET NOW TIMES NOW If you don't talk to Pakistan, you give terrorists and sponsors what they want: Former NSA By IANS   04.39   Shivshankar Menon | Sartaj Aziz | NSA | National Security Advisor \"It is not going to change the mind of the Pakistan Army which sponsors this cross-border terrorism or the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) or the jihadi tanzeems who undertake it, nor is it going to destroy their infrastructure or the courses they espouse and what motivates them. That is not going to change.\" NEW DELHI: India's former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon says there is no alternative to talking to Pakistan to resolve outstanding issues because not talking is to allow terrorists to have a \"veto on the relationship\" and submitting to the \"agenda of terrorists and their sponsors\". \"If you don't talk, you are actually giving the terrorists and their sponsors what they want, because they don't want talks... They want to control the dialogue. They want to have a veto on the relationship. So, I don't see why you should allow them to do that,\" Menon, who also served as Foreign Secretary and ambassador to important capitals, including Islamabad and Beijing, told IANS in a chat ahead of the formal launch of his book, \"Choices - Inside the Making of India's Foreign Policy\" (Penguin Random House). \"Talking doesn't mean you don't do the other things necessary to deal with the terrorists. You have to eliminate the terrorists, do what a state is supposed to do. \"But that also doesn't mean you stop talking. If you have an opportunity, do talk, and you have a lot to say... you do want the ceasefire to be restored, you don't want the standoff in the relationship with cross-border terrorism going on and on... and a lot of this with the support of the Pakistani state, and elements of the Pakistani state. \"We need to raise this and talk to them about it,\" Menon stated. He was speaking in the context of reports that Sartaj Aziz , Pakistan's foreign policy adviser, was coming to Amritsar early next month to attend the multinational 'Heart of Asia' conference on Afghanistan, raising questions about whether or not there should be bilateral talks between the two countries to break the ice following the Uri terror attack that left 19 Indian soldiers dead in September and a reprisal strike inside Pakistan by Indian Special Forces. Menon thinks use of application of military force -- or \"surgical strikes\" as India's cross-border action against \"terror launchpads\" in Pakistan were described -- had \"limited utility\". \"It is not going to change the mind of the Pakistan Army which sponsors this cross-border terrorism or the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) or the jihadi tanzeems who undertake it, nor is it going to destroy their infrastructure or the courses they espouse and what motivates them. That is not going to change.\" He said any way the tanzeems \"seek martydom\" and are not afraid to die. Menon reiterated that \"covert cross-border action\" had been undertaken by the previous administration too, but the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh decided not to go public with it as these strikes were more focused on outcomes rather than on influencing public opinion. \"If your goal is to effect public opinion at home, you have to deal with its consequences,\" said Menon, adding that these often raised public expectations of results and then \"control of escalation becomes a challenge\". \"The moment you go public, then these (expected outcomes) are unlikely to happen because then both sides' faces are involved. Both sides have to show that they have not been deterred or frightened.\" He said the Manmohan Singh \"kept quiet for a reason\" on the covert actions that were undertaken \"and the reasons (for not publicising them) are still valid\". Menon said the dilemma of dealing with Pakistan was that \"there was not one Pakistan\" as there were \"large portions of Pakistani society that was not inimical to India\". In his book, Menon says that \"an Indian policymaker must deal with several Pakistans -- with civil society, the Pakistani business community, civilian politicians, the army and the ISI, and the religious right (which extends from political parties to jihadi tanzeems). \"Not all of these Pakistans have the same attitude towards India, and each responds and acts differently towards India and Indians.\" He said thanks to \"Pakistan's decline into irrelevance, Indian motives to address India-Pakistan issues are diminishing. The tragedy is that Pakistan is increasingly becoming a single-issue country in Indian discourse, and that issue is the zero-sum one of security\". And, he says, as Pakistan becomes ever closer and more tied to China, \"India-Pakistan relations will bear the imprint and will probably pay the price\". The book, to be released by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, deals with difficult decisions in foreign policy and national security faced by India's government leaders and the choices they are often forced to make in the existing circumstances.

    "text": "Map: Kambalda 6442 \nA herd of feral goats that has plagued a Western Australian mining town for the better part of 2016 has been rounded up, despite a determined effort to sabotage the operation by some locals. Photo: Mr Hansen says Kambalda locals deliberately unlocked this pen, releasing 20 feral goats back into the wild. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Sam Tomlin) \nThe herd of around 300 goats has been wandering in and out of Kambalda, 50 kilometres south of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, for most of the year. \nComplaints of ravaged gardens and damaged property, as well as restrictions on council rangers' ability to deal with the animals, prompted the Shire of Coolgardie to bring in contract musterer Paul Hansen to round up the animals. \nBut despite successfully capturing 170 of the goats, Mr Hansen said locals had attempted to sabotage his work. \n\"The very first evening, I managed to get a mob into the yard, spoke to the responsible people and asked to leave the goats there,\" Mr Hansen said. \n\"But I went back the next day and that mob was gone.\" \nA further 20 goats had been set free the day ABC Local spoke to Mr Hansen, this time from a pen around 5 kilometres east of Kambalda. \nTyre tracks were visible leading up to and away from the empty pen. \n\"It was holding goats last night, but some kind person has come along and released them [and] it makes it almost impossible to recapture them,\" Mr Hansen said. Photo: Contract musterer Paul Hansen came from western New South Wales to deal with Kambalda's goat problem. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Sam Tomlin) Wild dogs, rough terrain make for tricky muster \nBased in western New South Wales, Mr Hansen took the Kambalda job on the recommendation of a friend who works in the local mines. \nWorking with offsider Mick King, the men used a motorbike and team of six dogs to flush the goats out and round them up. \n\"I though it was a busman's holiday, so I thought I'd come over and have a look,\" Mr Hansen said. \nHaving worked with livestock for most of his life, he said the unusual behaviour of the Kambalda goats made them particularly challenging to deal with. \n\"Here it's a little bit different — they see a dog and it's either attack mode, or flat out in reverse,\" Mr Hansen said. \n\"I've had a couple of dogs lifted by billies; one was lifted a metre and a half off the ground. \n\"Some of these fellas must be 10 or 11 years old. They're big and they've never been handled.\" \nHe said he believed the presence of wild dogs in the area was the reason behind the animals hostility and flightiness. Photo: Rolly the dog was one of a team of canines assisting Mr Hansen and offsider Mick King with rounding up the goats. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Sam Tomlin) Some residents happy for goats to stay \nBack in Kambalda East, where the goats did the bulk of their reported damage, locals were surprisingly divided over the issue. \nWhile complaints from residents forced the local council to act, long-time resident Jenny Milbourne said the animals should remain. \nShe said the complaints reflected the unwillingness of some new residents to adapt to life in the bush. \n\"The long-termers in town think it's ridiculous, but the newbies seem to want them eradicated,\" Ms Milbourne said. \n\"Since city people have been coming out in droves, they're the only ones who are whingeing.\" \nFellow resident Tina Taylor agreed. \n\"If it was something serious and not just their gardens being munched on, they might have a better leg to stand on,\" Ms Taylor said. \n\"When you're choosing a garden over an animal's life that's here and part of the community, it's just ridiculous.\" Photo: Mr Hansen managed to round up around 170 goats during his time in Kambalda. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Sam Tomlin) Goats now destined for meatworks \nWhile unable to tell if he wrangled the entire Kambalda herd, Mr Hansen said he believed he had accounted for a large majority. \nWith the venture west being less profitable and more frustrating than he initially anticipated, he said the trip had been a learning experience. \n\"As I said, it's been a busman's holiday and I've learned a lot,\" Mr Hansen said. \n\"I've driven the Nullarbor, which I'd never done, so it's a 'bucket list' thing.\" \nThe goats, now safely penned at a nearby station, will be shipped to meatworks in WA's Great Southern. \n\"They'll be sent down south towards Katanning and I'll be heading back east,\" Mr Hansen said. \n\"I've had my moments of drama ... there's never a dull moment.\"",

By comparison, Topaz Farm, which can generate up to 550 megawatts of power, took almost two years and over 2.5 billion in funds to build. \nAdani Group sponsored and oversaw the project. “Before us, the largest solar power plant at a single location was in California in the U.S. That was 550 MW and was completed in around three years. We wanted to set up a solar plant of 648 MW in a single location in less than a year,” said Adani CEO Vneet Jaain. \nWith the introduction of this solar farm, India is expected to become the world’s third-biggest solar market from next year, trailing behind only China and the US. \nStill, the country has a long way to go before reaching its goals to generate solar energy for 60 million homes by 2022, with plans to produce 40 percent of its power needs from non-fossil fuels by 2030. \nIn case you want to catch a glimpse of the colossal plant, National Geographic has previously made a documentary about Adani’s ambitious undertaking.",

    "text": "Sections News Peter Dutton reveals the US has a limit to the number of refugees it will take Michael Koziol, Political reporter Aa Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has acknowledged there is a limit to the number of refugees who will go to the US as part of a resettlement deal with Australia, but said it is \"not in our best interests\" to reveal the figure. He emphatically denied a Sky News report that claimed Washington may take just 300 or 400 of the 1600 refugees eligible to apply for resettlement in the US. \"That is completely false,\" Mr Dutton said. The Turnbull government has repeatedly refused to reveal how many refugees from Manus Island and Nauru the Obama Administration has agreed to take, or whether there is a cap. But Mr Dutton on Tuesday admitted there was such a limit, when asked directly if he had discussed it with the US. \"Yes and I'm not going to detail that, and there are very good reasons for that,\" he told Sky News. \"It's not in our best interests to have that number out there. [But] the reports about the 300 number are completely false. I don't want people to conjure up in their mind that this is limited by that number - it's not.\" Department of Immigration statistics show there were 872 men on Manus Island and 390 people on Nauru at the end of October. A further 750 people live outside the regional processing centre in the Nauruan community. There were also 377 people, including about 90 families, on the Australian mainland who were brought here for medical treatment. They are eligible to apply for the US offer but may have to return to Nauru or Manus first. A spokeswoman for the minister confirmed that of those 2400 people, about 1600 have been found to be refugees, with the others either found not be owed protection or still being processed. Sky News reported that 16 officers from the US Department of Homeland Security will arrive in Nauru on Sunday to commence work on the arrangement but it will not be finalised before Donald Trump is inaugurated on January 20. The pay-TV network, which was given rare access to Nauru, asylum seekers and officials, interviewed many refugees and found most were keen to settle in the US but were sceptical about it happening. Some were hostile to the idea. Aziz Khan, a Rohinga Muslim from Myanmar who has been on Nauru for two years, said he did not want to go to the US under Mr Trump. \"No, I don't prefer. Because I am a Muslim. The President-elect Donald Trump doesn't like Muslims in his country as a migrant,\" he said. Nauruan deputy police commissioner Kalinda Blake said police were concerned about the fate of those who are inevitably left behind, including the possibility they would commit acts of violence or self-harm. \"The Nauru Police force is actually putting plans in place just to cater for should that happen,\" she said on Sky News. \"I would not wish there would be any [cases of self-harm] but will be ready for it if there should be.\" In another of the Sky News program's revelations, acting Nauruan president David Adyang admitted the country had banned Australian media outlets from visiting the island, but waived it in certain circumstances. \"Selectively we bring in Australian media to try and provide balanced reporting on what we are doing,\" he said.

    "text": "Highway Patrol sergeant under investigation after he was found at home while on duty \nPosted 6:00 p.m. today   Find News Near Me \nGoldsboro, N.C. — The State Highway Patrol is conducting an internal investigation of a patrol sergeant who WRAL Investigates found at home when he was supposed to be working – even during a state of emergency. \nWRAL Investigates received a tip two months ago that Sgt. Maurice DeValle, an 18-year Highway Patrol veteran and a supervisor who makes $69,000 a year, wasn't showing up for his full work shifts. \nA news crew spent weeks tracking DeValle on various days he was working and routinely found his cruiser in the driveway of his Wake County home while he was on the clock, including while other Highway Patrol troopers put in nearly 24,000 hours of overtime during and after Hurricane Matthew responding to stranded drivers and keeping people off flooded roads. \nMuch of eastern North Carolina was under a state of emergency on Oct. 14, and the Neuse River was 10 feet above flood stage in Goldsboro. Dozens of Wayne County roads were impassable, but DeValle, one of the highest-ranking Highway Patrol troopers in the county, wasn't there when he was supposed to be. Instead, WRAL Investigates found his state-issued cruiser at his home more than an hour after he reported to the patrol that he was on duty in Wayne County. \nAccording to Highway Patrol policy, troopers \"... must be in their assigned duty station at the beginning of their assigned shift.\" \nBut that hasn't been the case for DeValle on a number of occasions: Oct. 1: DeValle reported he was on duty, but he never left his home for at least three hours. Oct. 6: DeValle was at home at 6:45 p.m., hours after reporting to patrol dispatch that he was on the road. Nov. 11: DeValle was at home an hour after calling in that he was on duty. \nPatrol officials said supervisors aren't allowed to complete paperwork at home while on the clock. All work must be done in the duty station, they said. \nWRAL Investigates also raised questions about where DeValle lives. His home is 35 miles from the Wayne County line – a 40-minute drive – although Highway Patrol policy requires troopers to live in the county where they work or get special permission to live within 20 miles of the county line. \nOfficials said he never obtained a special exemption to live outside of that 20-mile limit. \nDeValle hasn't responded to repeated requests for comment. \nAfter WRAL Investigates took its information to the Highway Patrol, officials placed DeValle on administrative duty and took away his cruiser, pending the outcome of the internal investigation.

Yet, at the same time, almost 40 percent of New Yorkers say they can’t afford to live here, the Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found. \nSixty-five percent of New York City voters said they’d rather remain here, while 32 percent say they would move out if they had the chance, according the poll. \nManhattanites were the most fiercely loyal, with 74 percent saying they wanted to stay. While Staten Islanders were the most ambivalent, with 57 percent saying they wanted to stay. \nBut roughly 37 percent of those surveyed said they can’t afford to live here, the poll found. This sentiment was highest among black voters, with 57 percent saying the city is too expensive. And 41 percent of white voters felt that way. \n“Sure it’s a nice place to visit, and people do want to live here. At least most of us do,” Maurice Carroll, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, said in a statement. “But, if the city is nice, it’s not cheap. Half of New Yorkers say they can’t afford to live here.” \nBrooklynites felt most burdened, with 52 percent saying they can’t afford it here. In Manhattan, only 38 percent said it was too expensive. \nThe survey results should come as little surprise. \nNearly 900,000 of the city’s rental households —roughly 42 percent of renters — are rent-burdened, according to a report from the Citizen’s Budget Commission. That means they pay more than 30 percent of their household income on rent. Half of those households are “severely” rent burdened, paying more than half their income on rent. \nThe city also continues to struggle to address the record number of homeless people, with 60,000 individuals in shelters. \nAnd while the city is becoming increasingly expensive, the quality of life here isn’t all that great, according to those surveyed in the Quinnipiac poll. \nOnly 7 percent of New York City voters rated the quality of life as “very good.” \nIn the last few years, the quality of life in the city has gotten worse, 44 percent said. \nThe poll, conducted from Nov. 9 to 15, surveyed more than 1,200 New York City voters via land lines and cellphones.",

    "text": "Hamilton’ s Brandon Victor Dixon Says “There’s Nothing to Apologize For.” by Charline Jao | 3:23   \nThe cast of Hamilton delivered a message to VP-elect Mike Pence over the weekend, telling him they hope the show will encourage him to fight for the rights of all Americans. Pence commented saying he didn’t take offense at the message, but Trump fired off a series of tweets demanding an apology from the cast. Brandon Victor Dixon, the actor who portrays Aaron Burr and who read the message, refused to talk less and smile more in a CBS appearance where he addressed some of the backlash. \nIn response to a comment saying that they could have spoke to him backstage, the actor responds that Pence should have had the option to come backstage, and encourages the soon-to-be VP to have a conversation with them there. To answer why he was the one to read the message, Dixon explains that it was a request from producer Jeffrey Seller and that he was happy to do it, and even felt honored to do so. \nFor me, I think the most important thing with respect to all of the emotions that everyone’s feeling after this election is to make sure people recognize that we are not alone. We are here together and we need to listen to one another and speak with one another and those of us who feel like maybe their voice has been marginalized or might become marginalized–it’s important to recognize that there are allies all over the place. \nDixon also reveals in the interview that Seller, director Thomas Kail, and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda were all involved in crafting the message. The message was then read in front of the cast, who made additional adjustments before it was presented for Pence. \nTo the demand of an apology, Dixon simply takes a sip from his cup and says, “There’s nothing to apologize for.” When asked whether he was worried this would set off other theater disruptions in the face of a recent audience interruption in Chicago (a man acted with extreme hostility and said things like “We won. Trump is President. Get over it”), the actor dismissed this concern. \nWhen you have a platform, art is meant to bring people together. It’s meant to raise consciousness. And when you have a platform like that–I told Jeffrey Sellers after that, “I applaud you all for not throwing away your shot. For taking a moment to spread a message of love. To spread a message of unity.” We’re not here to boo. We’re here to cheer each other on.” \nA point that wasn’t brought up in the interview were the various voices that called the incident a “distraction” from other news stories. It’s understandable that while we’re trying to balance the many horrendous, appalling, and urgent stories concerning Trump’s upcoming administrations (like the $25 million Trump University settlement ), many will feel frustrated that the majority of public attention is towards a specific story that feels like “fluff.” However, I think it’s important not to write off the words of artists of color in a production as important and popular as Hamilton. Like Dixon says, that platform is powerful, and we should be paying attention to how they’re using it to facilitate conversation and change. There’s room for both of those stories, and as we get closer to inauguration, I imagine we’ll have to learn how to balance them even more. \nDixon voices everything that theatre should strive for and even extends an offer that mirrors the Trump seat George Takei saved at Allegiance. “We welcome Donald Trump here at Hamilton, ” the actor says, “I think the power of the show and the way we tell it is undeniable. I think it’s important for everyone to see a show like ours.” \n(via Variety , Featured Image via CBS) \n ",

Advertisement \n“A cosplayer will typically only wear a costume at a convention for maybe 2-6 hours before changing back into street clothes or into another costume.”, Hillier says . “In that time they will be asked for hundreds of photographs. Those photographs will be shared online to thousands of people. Those few hours will be the embodiment of how thousands of people recognize them. Yet for almost all cosplayers this is only a tiny fraction of what they do. For every hour spent cosplaying many more are spent crafting their costumes and yet those hours are widely overlooked.” \n“For this project I wanted to photograph popular cosplayers in their most recognizable form to the general public and contrast that with how they actually spend the majority of time cosplaying.” Advertisement \nThe images he took show each cosplayer hard at work on the outfit he later photographed them in. There’s a full collection on Paul’s site, including interviews with each cosplayer, but I’ve shared some highlights below.

Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP Trump faces hurdles to reinstating waterboarding 1  /  4 Back to Gallery WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump backs waterboarding and his pick for CIA director has called those who have done it \"patriots\" not \"torturers.\" Yet a Trump administration faces steep legal and legislative hurdles to reinstate the interrogation practice that simulates drowning.\nUnder a law approved last year, all government employees, including intelligence agents, must abide by Army guidelines for interrogating prisoners — guidelines that don't permit waterboarding. Those rules are subject to review, but it's not clear if they can be revised to allow the practice.\nIf the Trump administration were to try to change the law or the guidelines, the effort would run into bipartisan opposition in Congress. The most formidable obstacle there would be a fellow Republican, John McCain . The Arizona senator, who was beaten as a prisoner of war in Vietnam in the 1960s, adamantly opposes waterboarding. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , he would be well-positioned to block any attempt to revive it.\nMcCain has clashed before with Trump, who during the campaign claimed the former Navy pilot wasn't a war hero because he had been captured. At a security conference in Canada last weekend, McCain indicated he was ready to take on Trump again as begins another six-year term after winning re-election.\n\"I don't give a damn what the president of the United States wants to do or anybody else wants to do,\" McCain said. \"We will not waterboard. We will not do it.\"\nWaterboarding and other harsh methods were used in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to try to obtain useful information from terrorist suspects. Many intelligence, military and law enforcement officials say the practice is ineffective as well as immoral. They say it breaks down trust between the suspect and interrogators and often prompts a detainee to say anything to stop the harsh treatment.\nBut Trump, who revved up his supporters with tough talk against against Islamic State extremists, pledged to interrogate terrorist suspects with waterboarding and a \"hell of a lot worse.\"\n\"Don't tell me it doesn't work,\" Trump said. \"Torture works, OK folks?\"\nTrump's nominee for CIA is Rep. Mike Pompeo , a conservative congressman from Kansas who has criticized President Barack Obama for \"ending our interrogation program,\" which Obama did not do. Pompeo criticized the release of the Senate's 2014 report on harsh interrogation of detainees and argued that the CIA program operated within the law.\n\"Our men and women who were tasked to keep us safe in the aftermath of 9/11 — our military and our intelligence warriors — are ... not torturers, they are patriots,\" Pompeo said then.\nThe views of Trump's other nominees are more opaque.\nTrump's national security adviser, Retired Army Lt. General Michael Flynn , has not ruled out the use of waterboarding. \"If the nation was in grave danger from a terrorist attack involving weapons of mass destruction, and we had certain individuals in our custody with information that might avoid it, then I would probably OK enhanced interrogation techniques within certain limits,\" he told Politico in October.\nTrump's pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions , R-Ala., was one of a few senators who voted against bipartisan anti-torture provisions in 2005 and 2015. But in 2008, Sessions said: \"I am glad we are no longer utilizing waterboarding. I hope we never have to do it again.\" That was before the rise of IS militants.\nAnd on Tuesday, Trump told The New York Times that he asked retired Marine Gen. James Mattis , a strong prospect for defense secretary, about waterboarding and was surprised to hear Mattis does not favor it.\nWaterboarding has been prohibited since 2009. Two days after taking office, Obama issued an executive order prohibiting all government employees from using any interrogation method that wasn't spelled out in the Army Field Manual, a military how-to guide.\nWanting to ensure that no future president could tear up the order, McCain teamed up with Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif., to turn it into law. Their anti-torture amendment was adopted in a 78-21 bipartisan vote and became law late last year.\nThe law requires the Army to conduct a review of the field manual every three years in consultation with the attorney general, the FBI director and the director of national intelligence. The first review deadline is Dec. 19, 2017, during Trump's first year in office.\nIt's not clear if the review could result in changes allowing waterboarding or other harsh interrogation methods.\nThe best interrogation methods build rapport with suspects, according to the High-Value Detainee Group , a team of the nation's top interrogators who deploy to question detainees around the world. The group recently issued a report on the best interrogation practices, based on the latest behavioral and social science research.\nHuman rights advocates have long fought against any resumption of harsh interrogation techniques. They say the intelligence community stands firmly against it and point to a comment made this year by former CIA Director Michael Hayden . He said: \"If any future president wants (the) CIA to waterboard anybody, he better bring his own bucket, because CIA officers aren't going to do it.\"",

(Photo: Tony Ding/Associated Press) \nBack at Pickerington (Ohio) North high school, it seemed remote. \nBut on Saturday, it will be reality: Michigan All-America tight end Jake Butt and Ohio State All-America offensive lineman Pat Elflein, high school teammates, will meet before The Game. \n“I told him back in January when he got elected captain, I congratulated him,” Butt said this week. “We were both two-time captains for North in high school. I was like, ‘How cool would that be if we met at the 50-yard line before The Game (as captains)?’ And sure enough, that’s going to happen this week.” \nThe friendship that goes back to high school in Pickerington, a Columbus suburb, transcends Saturday’s battle between No. 2 Ohio State and No. 4 Michigan. \n► Related : BTN remembers 2006 Michigan-Ohio State game \n“We keep in touch,” Butt said. “When I say Pat’s a good friend of mine, I mean that. We stay in touch in season, out of season. I don’t really get to go home during the season so we don’t really get to see each other, but we stay in touch. We both care about each other.” \nYet this is a week that divides friends, especially those battling for the same goal. The winner has a good shot at reaching the College Football Playoff. \nElflein already has a national title from 2014, but that only means he wants another one. \nWhile the Buckeyes were soaring that year, Butt was returning from an ACL tear early and enduring a collapse and coach firing later in the season. \nMichigan defensive end Taco Charlton (Photo: Julia Nagy LSJ) \nFor them to meet with everything on the line two years later seemed improbable then. Now, it’s too real. \nThey’re the most visible representatives of their town, Pickerington, which has four players in this game, two on each side. Elflein is joined by Pickerington Central redshirt freshman defensive tackle Davon Hamilton and Butt has senior defensive end Taco Charlton. \nButt and Charlton both enrolled early their freshman year and lived together for a few years, making a few of the 31/2-hour drives back home together. \n“We still knew each other and once we both committed we started to talk more than we did before,” Charlton said. “Once we got here we were as close as can be. That’s my brother right there. We’re super close.” \n► Related : Michigan vs. Ohio State 2006: An oral history \nFor the city of Pickerington to produce three starters in this game, all who should be upper-round NFL draft picks, is unusual. \n“My class, the class above us, the class below us, we’ve got a lot of really good athletes and I think it helped growing up that we had a lot of talent so we could push each other,” said Butt, who never got serious interest from the Buckeyes in recruiting. “I guess that all played a factor in how we got to this level.” \nCharlton’s family will have divided loyalties. \n“It’s different — growing up 10-15 minutes from the stadium, actually being born at Ohio State University hospital — it’s different for my family, some of whom are Ohio State fans, they just cheer for me,” Charlton said. “It’s a weird week for them. But you’ve still got my mom, dad and little sister who are still die-hard Michigan fans now. So they definitely support me. It’ll be fun to play in my home city.” \nButt, Charlton and Elflein have brought Pickerington back to the forefront, a town physically close to one campus but on Saturday trapped between the two. \nIt’ll start at the 50-yard line for everyone, with two Pickerington kids shaking hands. \n“That will be cool for us,” Elflein told reporters in Columbus this week. “It will be cool for Pickerington, back home. And our families and friends that we grew up with. \n“It’s going to be cool to see two guys out of the same town, to make it and be captains of their teams, especially in a rivalry like this. It will be cool to represent Pickerington.” \nJeff Seidel contributed. Contact Mark Snyder at . Follow him on Twitter at @mark__snyder.

    "text": "Fracking report says no to controversial process without community consent Updated November 29, 2016 18:04:27 Map: Mount Gambier 5290 \nUnconventional gas exploration or production should not go ahead in South Australia's south-east without a social licence, the Natural Resources Committee has recommended. \nThe committee, which has spent two years looking into the industry and the process of hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\", tabled its report in State Parliament. \nIt also found that while the specific process of fracking was unlikely to pose significant risks to groundwater when properly managed, other processes associated with unconventional gas extraction, including mid to long-term well integrity and surface spills, presented risks that need to be considered. \nPresiding member Steph Key said the committee had determined a social licence does not yet exist for the development of an unconventional gas industry in the state's south-east. \n\"This has been made starkly apparent by widespread opposition from the local community and it is the overarching finding of the inquiry,\" Ms Key said. Committee's recommendations: Without social licence, unconventional gas exploration should not proceed Processes associated with unconventional gas exploration must be properly considered and managed A review of the Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000 would be appropriate Potential for disruption to land and local communities should be addressed in agreements A definitive proposal for unconventional gas development should be produced before any further consideration can be given to potential economic benefits \n\"This is not to say unconventional gas exploration and development should never occur in the region, but that in the committee's view, obtaining social licence is a necessary precondition to such development occurring.\" \nIn the report, the committee said it received vivid evidence of a communication gap between the industry's proponents and the Limestone Coast community. \nOverall, 178 written submissions were received and 66 witnesses presented evidence, including residents and businesspeople from the south-east, along with local government representatives. \n\"Throughout the inquiry, all evidence the committee heard, both for and against unconventional gas development, has been in the context of myriad external forces including climate change considerations, production and export price, export demand, technological advances, renewable energy growth and very notably, public opinion,\" Ms Key said. Opposition proposes 10-year ban \nOpposition Leader Steven Marshall said he supported the report's findings, and wanted to prevent fracking in south-east SA. \n\"I announce today that if we're elected in March 2018 we'll put a 10 year moratorium on fracking in the south-east,\" Mr Marshall said. \n\"This is a vitally important very productive part of our state. At the moment the confidence of the primary producers in that area has been undermined by the threat of fracking in the south-east.\" \nBut Treasurer Tom Koutsantonis said a moratorium would put a stranglehold on economic development. \n\"He's [Mr Marshall] opposed to building infrastructure. He's opposed to a new hospital. Now he's opposed to the oil and gas sector and a referendum on nuclear industries,\" Mr Koutsantonis said. \n\"This man is trying to stifle SA and build on their fears rather than build up their hopes.\"",

    "text": "This article was originally published on The Conversation . Read the original article . \nPolls indicate that one demographic slice instrumental in electing Donald Trump was white women . Indeed, 53 percent of white women cast their votes in his direction . \nThere’s current debate on why this might be – blatant or veiled racism, admiration for Trump’s business prowess or supporting someone who’s fired up to protect us from terrorism and radical Islam. But one unrecognized and insidious force – one that some women will likely minimize or deny – is internalized gynophobia . \nMany people are familiar with the term homophobia – dislike of or prejudice against people who are homosexual. Some of us may even know the phrase “internalized homophobia” – when lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, transgender and queer people take on society’s negative perceptions about them, leading to devaluation and poor regard for themselves. \nAs a clinical psychologist, I avoid engaging in armchair analysis. But watching this election, and the strong resistance to a female candidate, I’ve found myself wondering if the women who vehemently oppose Hillary Clinton suffer some kind of version of related self-loathing. And, I worry about the consequences for women’s health. \nIt’s curious to me that women were so opposed to a female candidate and unwilling to excuse her flaws – but that they overlooked the flaws of a male candidate who had made many disparaging words against women. \nWe do know that harmful words, attitudes and actions harm women’s health. The effects of rape, discrimination and harassment are long-lasting, affecting the personal and professional lives of women for decades. \nThe health effects of sexual assault for women across their lifespan are potentially enormous. For example, even after controlling for other childhood adversities, childhood sexual abuse was associated with the subsequent onset of 14 mood, anxiety and substance use disorders among women – depression, dysthymia, mania, agoraphobia, panic attack, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, alcohol problems, alcohol dependence, drug problems, drug dependence and severe drug dependence. Soak that in for a minute. \nThe frequency and intensity of sexual harassment are also related to physical and mental health problems for women, as well as difficulties in work and interpersonal activities . \nWas it hate speech? \nIf you’re a woman and you cast your ballot for Trump, I’m not looking to judge you. You are my family members and my friends. And I care about you deeply. \nI’m asking you to quietly consider how you feel about your own power – where you feel it comes from (your role as mother, daughter, spouse, worker) and how comfortable you are with sources of your power that are not defined by traditional nurturing roles. I’m also asking you to respectfully join me in thinking through this potential issue, as I believe it holds us and our country back. \nThis is important because of the potential health as well as social effects. Already, millions of women have felt at least temporarily depressed by the election of a man who they believe values women only if they look a certain way – tall, young, long-legged and big-breasted. He has repeatedly graded women on the “1-10” scale, saying that a woman with small breasts would have a hard time being rated “a 10.” In addition, he reportedly told talk show host Howard Stern that it was OK to call his daughter “a piece of ass.” Had he been speaking of another group of people, it might have been viewed as “hate speech.” \nRecently, three middle-aged white women friends from college called me up, out of the blue. They had gotten together for a girls’ weekend and wanted to say “hi.” I was delighted to hear from them. We hadn’t spoken in almost 15 years. \nAs the conversation went on, their negative opinions on Hillary came out from, “being a bad role model for our children by staying in a relationship with her husband after he cheated on her” to “not caring about the American people.” Stupefied, I began asking them questions to understand their thinking. \nI’m not saying that women ought to always like or support one another. But the vehemence which is projected onto the screen of Hillary is disconcerting and needs examination. The calls of “lock her up” did not come from men only. This leads me to wonder about the role of self-loathing. Woman holding a ‘lock her up’ sign. Evan Vucci/AP \nWomen voting for Trump may say something about how women feel about their own power as well as who has the power to govern. Political scientists have proved women’s overwhelming effectiveness in federal and state government. Thus, based on their effectiveness in office, one might think that the bias would be reversed, unless there’s something very deep going on inside. \nWith internalized gynophobia, there seems to be disproportionate dependence – believing that only men can take care of us, disempowerment without the protection and support of a man, severe self-limits in asking for our needs to be meet at home and on the job, and woman-bashing. \nOf course this is a simplification. And not every stress or intensity of being LGBTQ can be equated with being women. Women in the U.S. don’t typically experience fear of being disowned because of their gender, and we don’t typically face overt disapproval within our religious communities. \nWe also don’t have to come out or fear getting “outed.” Our family, friends, workplace, world and religion can tell we’re women by looking at us. But we do share some historical and contemporary parallel experiences with the LGBTQ population in terms of oppression – fear of discrimination or violence and societal judgment and disapproval. \nThe impact of internalized homophobia on psychological distress has been fairly well-documented. Fear and loathing of self negatively influences the mental health of the LGBTQ population. Gay men reporting higher levels of internalized homophobia are less likely to have come out of the closet and thus be their authentic selves. I wonder if the same could be true for women who experience internalized gynophobia. \nSimilar to sexually diverse populations, women are at an increased risk for mental health concerns . And there have been studies on women’s self-loathing and its relationship to acceptance of their bodies as well as eating patterns . \nA roster of contributing factors \nThere’s probably a host of conscious and unconscious reasons contributing to internalized gynophobia. Maybe personality traits like deference. Or maybe it’s coming from women from traditional backgrounds, who are taught through upbringing or socialization processes to be a dutiful and good girl. \n\nIt may also come from women who have learned to value themselves by their attractiveness and see their power solely or primarily through the seduction of and protection by men. \nWhatever the cause, the world could benefit from healthily addressing issues such as internalized gynophobia, expected rejection, stereotyping and oppression. Discrimination and sexual harassment at work go beyond even mental and physical health. Sexual harassment is a significant public health problem that also affects work-related satisfaction and functioning. \nOne potential mechanism to support sexual minorities’ resilience is the development of growth-fostering relationships – authentic and mutual connections with close LGBTQ friends. Others might be to acknowledge the gynophobia or sexism implicit in our world and work to counter the internalized gynophobia that may occur in us or others. \nAgain, I’m not saying that every woman should have been “with Her.” And let me be clear, this is not just about our feelings toward Hillary. Other powerful women in business or leadership has felt the deep cuts of rejection before – Martha Stewart, Carly Fiorina, Meg Whitman, Marisa Meyer, to name a few. \nBut in this post-election, it would be helpful and healing and maybe even protective for all of us to understand that Hillary’s femaleness was not the deal-breaker. And I offer my hand in community to all willing to explore this perspective further.",

LeBoeuf \nLiquids shared mouth-to-mouth by social insects contain proteins and small molecules that can influence the development and organisation of their colonies, according to new findings published in eLife . \nThe study from the University of Lausanne, Switzerland, suggests Florida carpenter ants can collectively influence their communities by shifting the cocktail of proteins, hormones and other small molecules that they pass mouth-to-mouth to one another and their young through a process called trophallaxis. \n\"Food is passed to every adult and developing ant by trophallaxis. This creates a network of interactions linking every member of the colony,\" says senior author Laurent Keller, Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution. \n\"A lot of researchers consider trophallaxis only as a means of food-sharing,\" adds Professor Richard Benton of the Center for Integrative Genomics, also a senior author of the study. \"But trophallaxis occurs in other contexts, such as when an ant is reunited with a nest-mate after isolation. We therefore wanted to see if the fluid exchanged by trophallaxis contains molecules that allow ants to pass other chemical messages to each other, and not just food.\" \nTo answer this question, the team, led by first author and postdoctoral researcher Dr Adria LeBoeuf, analysed fluid from pairs of ants engaged in trophallaxis. Surprisingly, they identified a large number of proteins that appear to be involved in regulating the growth of ants, along with high levels of juvenile hormone , an important regulator of insect development, reproduction, and behaviour. Carpenter ants ( Camponotus floridanus ) are exchanging fluid mouth-to-mouth by trophallaxis. Credit: Adria C. LeBoeuf \nTo see what effect this hormone has on the growth of larvae fed by trophallaxis, the scientists added it to the food of larvae-rearing ants and discovered that the hormone made it twice as likely that the larvae would survive to reach adulthood. \n\"This indicates that juvenile hormone and other molecules transferred mouth-to-mouth over this social network could be used by the ants to collectively decide how their colony develops,\" says LeBoeuf. \"So, when the ants feed their larvae, they aren't just feeding them food, they are casting quantitative ballots for their colony, administering different amounts of growth-promoting components to influence the next generation. \n\"The effects of juvenile hormone that we see are consistent with previous studies in other ants and in bees where larvae treated with an analogue of this hormone tend to develop into larger workers and even queens.\" \nAlong with growth proteins and juvenile hormone, the team also identified small molecules and chemical signals in the carpenter ants' trophallactic liquid that help them recognize their nest-mates. They demonstrated for the first time the presence of chemical cues in the fluid that are known to be important in providing ants with a colony-specific odour that allows them to distinguish family from non-family members. \n\"Overall, we show that liquid transmitted among ants contains much more than food and digestive enzymes,\" adds LeBoeuf. \"Our findings suggest that trophallaxis underlies a private communication channel that ants use to direct the development of their young, similar to milk in mammals.\" \n\"More generally, this opens the possibility that the oral exchange of fluids, such as saliva, in other animals might also serve previously unsuspected roles.\"",

Source: Tweet \nThe Greens will be calling for a Senate inquiry into Attorney General George Brandis over what it has described as a \"murky affair\" with the Western Australian Government. \nSenator Brandis reportedly struck a deal with WA allowing the state to claw back $1 billion from Alan Bond's collapsed Bell Group earlier this year rather than the Commonwealth. \n\"We think that to initiate a Senate inquiry would allow us to get to the bottom of what appears to be a very murky affair,\" Greens Senator Nick McKim told ABC radio on Sunday.

    "text": "FYI, Almonds Are Not Nuts. And Neither Are A Lot Of Other 'Nuts.' Everything we know is a lie. 11/28/2016 11:09 am ET \nWe all know almonds are a healthy snack and a great dessert ingredient . \nBut get this: almonds are not nuts. They’re seeds of a fruit. \nMore specifically, they’re seeds of the almond fruit , which grows on a tree and is very similar to a peach, botanically speaking. When the almond fruit is ripe, we remove its flesh and shell, then eat the small kernel inside. Check it out: Flowerphotos via Getty Images Unripe almond fruit hangs on a tree. Bloomberg via Getty Images A farmer cuts open the fruit's fuzzy hull to reveal the seed inside. ullstein bild via Getty Images When the almonds are ripe, their hulls split open. Andia via Getty Images The hulls get dry and curled , exposing the inner almond pit. GomezDavid via Getty Images See that pit in there? The seed we eat is just underneath it. Here’s why almonds are not nuts. \nIn the botanical world, a nut is a dry, hard-shelled fruit . But as you can see, almonds have a fleshy outer layer. Therefore they’re technically not nuts, but a different kind of fruit called a drupe , said Tom Gradziel , an almond researcher at the University of California, Davis. \nYou could compare them to another drupe you know well. \n“Almonds are basically peaches,” Gradziel told HuffPost. “But instead of the fruity part becoming fleshy, most of it sizes up in the kernel.” \nAlmonds are indeed a member of the prunus family that includes peaches, though not the same species. The plants are incredibly similar . Both Gradziel and Richard Rosecrance , a fruit tree researcher at California State University, Chico, told of farmers in Asia who breed peach-like fruits for their large, edible kernels, which can be removed from the pit and snacked on like almonds. \nIn the U.S., farmers mix almonds’ outer flesh into feed for dairy cows , Gradziel said. A lot of other nuts aren’t “nuts,” either. \nMany of the other foods we call “nuts” aren’t actually nuts , either. Similar to almonds, walnuts and pistachios are are not nuts because they grow fleshy, leathery exteriors instead of hard shells, Gradziel says. \nSee? Tim Graham via Getty Images A walnut tree. ATTA KENARE via Getty Images A pistachio tree. \nThere are other factors that determine true nuts from non-nuts, but looking at their shell (or lack thereof) is one obvious way botanists tell the difference. Gradziel confirmed that cashews and pecans aren’t nuts, either. \nAn acorn , on the other hand, is a prime example of a true nut because it has a hard outer shell. However, you’re still allowed to call them “nuts.” \nThe culinary use of the word “nut” is much broader and looser in definition, so you can use it as you always have and fare just fine around cooks or fellow snackers. A scientist, however, may want to debate the issue. And allergies are a nutty case, too. \nWe also use a loose definition of “nut” when talking about allergies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration groups almonds with walnuts and pecans in a broader “tree nut” category. \nYou can be allergic to just one “tree nut,” but some groups of nuts tend to cause allergy symptoms together , said Dr. James Baker , chief medical officer of the the patient advocacy group Food Allergy Research & Education. People who are allergic to walnuts also tend to get irritated by pecans, he says. If you’re allergic to almonds, it’s more likely you’re allergic to cashews, Brazil nuts and pistachios. Hazelnuts fall into both groups. \nThis, Baker says, is because many “nuts” have similar allergy-causing proteins with a particular tendency to bring on symptoms. If you have allergy symptoms after eating nuts ― either true nuts or what we merely call nuts ― Baker recommends visiting an allergist. \nIf not, snack on.",

Barrett.\n“That wasn’t a first down,” Harbaugh said flatly (read more of Harbaugh’s comments here ).\nFrom the Big Ten’s news release:\nThe Big Ten determined that Harbaugh’s postgame comments regarding officials were in violation of Big Ten Conference Agreement 10.01, which states in part that “The Big Ten Conference expects all contests involving a member institution to be conducted without compromise to any fundamental element of sportsmanship. Such fundamental elements include integrity of competition, civility toward all, and respect, particularly toward opponents and officials.”\nCoaches are teachers as well, and there is an expectation that they set the example for students and others in the area of sportsmanship.\nIn addition to the controversial spot that awarded Barrett a first down (preceding Curtis Samuel’s game-winning touchdown run), Harbaugh was upset about a pass interference call on Ohio State’s game-tying fourth quarter drive. The coach was also flagged 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct.\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh wasn’t too happy with the officiating in the Wolverines’ loss to Ohio State.

    "text": "WATCH: Aqib Talib Shoves Jordan Norwood After Muffed Punt Against Chiefs Chad Jensen 2:41 PM / Originally published on Mile High Huddle Aqib Talib was fired up after Jordan Norwood muffed a punt early in the fourth quarter of Denver's 30-27 overtime loss to Kansas City. \nThe way the Denver Broncos play football — keeping their cards close to the vest — their margin for error is slim. They can ill-afford mental errors, coverage breakdowns or costly turnovers, especially late in a single-score game. \nField position becomes a penultimate key. \nhttp://www.scout.com/story/1731476-scout-s-cyber-monday-sale-is-on?s=101 Unfortunately, a multitude of errors was how the cookie crumbled for the Broncos on Sunday night vs. the Kansas City Chiefs . There were several Denver breakdowns — a safety and free kick returned for a touchdown among them. \nOne of the toughest pills to swallow was Jordan Norwood 's muffed punt early in the fourth quarter, which was recovered by the Chiefs. The Broncos were trailing the Chiefs by six points and the defense had just forced Alex Smith off the field on a three-and-out. \nKansas City punter Dustin Colquitt was forced to punt from his own endzone. Had Norwood simply secured the catch, it would have given Trevor Siemian and company excellent field position, inside Kansas City territory. \nInstead, the Broncos defense, which had been battling for three hard-fought quarters, were forced to trot back out onto the field. As Norwood was exiting the field, cornerback Aqib Talib and the defense were taking it. Talib could be seen shoving Norwood from behind, with some choice words. \nhttps://twitter.com/MySportsUpdate/status/803087052120072193 \nThe Broncos defense forced Kansas City to punt again on the ensuing possession, but it flipped field position, pinning Siemian and the offense back on their own 12-yard line. The Chiefs didn't get any points out of it, but it was a mental error in a high-stakes Divisional bout. \nTalib was justifiably fired up, but every NFL player screws up once in a while. Norwood was already kicking himself, and likely didn't need one of his teammates to add insult to injury. \nPerhaps Talib's frustration is symptomatic of a reported \"rift\" that's taking place inside the Broncos locker room, between the defense and the offense. The defense has carried this team for most of the season, and it's apparently wearing thin on them. \nNorwood's muffed punt was technically a special teams gaffe, but nevertheless, Talib and the defense were frustrated. It's one thing to be emotional. But the concern is that where there's smoke, there's fire. \nHead Coach Gary Kubiak commented on the Talib-Norwood incident via the Denver Post. \n“Let me just say this: We compete at the highest level, and our guys compete all the time — practice, game, those type of things,” Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Monday . “I see guys competing, guys are upset. Jordan and Aqib are fine, I can tell you that. That’s not an issue. Obviously emotions get in the way and those are things we got to talk about and stuff and control our emotions. But it’s a very competitive environment down there and there was no harm intended, I can tell you that. Those guys are fine and we’ll continue to compete.” \nIt was a very tough loss and one that the Broncos can only hope to learn from. However, if there truly is a rift growing inside the locker room, that does not portend well for a strong, unified Broncos team heading down the stretch. \nChad Jensen is the Publisher of Mile High Huddle.

Potentially.' \nDraxler and Wolfsburg have struggled for form this season, with the club sitting in a disappointing 14th place in the table. \nHowever, Allofs believes the ex-Schalke winger is determined to help the club get back on track, making a move in the January transfer window unlikely. \n'This story doesn't help him, or Wolfsburg,' Allofs added. 'He wants to get back to his level, he wants to help.' \nDraxler remains keen on a move away from the Volkswagen Arena, but he insists that he will not push for a deal to be done like he did during the previous window. \nDraxler runs with the ball during Wolfsburg's Bundesliga clash with Darmstadt this season\nThe former Schalke star unsuccessfully pushed for a move away from Wolfsburg last summer \n'There was a lot of speculation during the summer and some things were true, while others were false,' he told German magazine Kicker in September. 'There will likely be more speculation in January, but I will not initiate anything. \n'I am only human and what has happened has not left me unaffected. Football is business, though, and you have to focus on the task at hand. \n'It is not always easy, but I know what's expected from me. I will work hard to do just that. \n'We had some differences of opinion, but we have set those apart. There is no issue any more.

    "text": "0 \nE-40’s Block Brochure: Welcome to the Soil Vol. 2 single “ Function” earned gold status earlier this month. The YG , IAMSU! and Problem -assisted banger has also inspired the moniker of a monthly Hip Hop experience in Mexico City. \n“The whole goal of ‘Function’ is to really provide a place for rap fans here in Mexico City to come hang out and bridge the gap between the underground Hip Hop scene here and what I know back in the U.S.,” explained Houston’s own Fat Tony to DX in a recent phone conversation. \nAccording to the RABDARGAB rapper, the idea came after performing at last year’s NRMAL Music Festival taking place in the largest metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere. Coming back to the city this past February, he linked up with local promoters who were really into Hip Hop but who lacked the outlet to reach out to more artists. \n“I could tell that Hip Hop wasn’t as popular in this city as it was in the U.S., but the people that I met who were into it were deeply into it,” he said. \nBeing a fan of the League Of Starz-produced E-40 single, Fat Tony felt the title perfectly applied to his ambition. \n“Honestly, I love that song,” he said. “It’s a good way to describe the party and it alludes to the fact that people are jumping around and having fun. Not just standing around and watching, everyone is as involved in it as the performer.” \nThe structure for “Function” is simple. \nEvery show features an international artist plus a local Mexican artist. Meanwhile, Fat Tony serves as the resident DJ and handles administrative duties. Giving suggestions for some of his favorite emcees from the area, he named Yoga Fire and El Aleman. \n“It’s really not about me as an artist but, it’s about me as a curator and DJ,” he explained. “I’m the one who hand picks all the talent to perform and I’m the one that found the budget, sponsors and set everything up on the administrative side. I promote it along with the venue and sponsors I have on board.” \nFat Tony also hopes his events will broaden the rap taste for fans of Hip Hop within the city who are more into pure East Coast sounds. \n“One thing that I noticed about rap fans out there earlier on is that a lot of Hip Hop fans here were closed minded as they were only into East Coast 90s boom bap and other styles of rap was foreign to them,” he explained. “One major thing that I wanted to accomplish with my parties was to let them know that Hip Hop is a diverse and complicated genre full of nuances and you can’t limit it to one sound. I play Gucci Mane and Gang Starr . I’ll play Lil B and Three 6 Mafia . I’ll play Common and Outkast.” \nUnfortunately, Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency may dismantle progress he’s made in Mexico City. Fat Tony calls the idea of building a large wall on the Mexican border “totally bullshit.” \n“I had a thought that this might be some of the last times for the next couple of years that Mexican rap fans get to see American artists and vice-versa,” he continued. “It’s been on my mind the entire time and it’s really motivated me to go harder with this knowing that there is a real chance it’ll be more difficult to do this next year. I would be completely embarrassed if the United States did that to Mexico.” \nWhile Fat Tony attempts to establish Mexico City as Hip Hop’s next international hub, he’s also continuing his own output of musical content. Releasing “Legal Weed” the day after the presidential election, he joined producer Kyle Mabson as duo Charge It To The Game. Though the two dropped the Urban Hall of Fame EP earlier this year, they also have plans for a full-length LP in 2017. A solo album from him is due around that time as well.  ",

The Hello singer thanked her band and the audience who had come out to support her in Phoenix, Arizona saying: \"Give it up for my band! Give it up for me! I did it! I'll see you on the other side. In a couple of years, I'll be back, and you won't be able to get rid of me.\" \nBefore leaving the stage, the 28-year-old was then heard saying she was going to \"have a baby\".

Media: brian.rogers@chron.com / The Houston Chronicle \nA Texas middle school teacher who was impregnated by a 13-year-old student could face up to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child. \nAlexandria Vera, who was arrested in June, told police that she fell in love with one of her students after the two began a relationship through Instagram messages. The 24-year-old former eighth-grade English teacher at Stovall Middle School in Houston also said that the boy's family was supportive of the affair. \nVera, who pleaded guilty on Wednesday, was initially charged with continuous sexual assault of a child, which carries a maximum punishment of life in prison. By pleading guilty to a lesser charge, her sentence was capped at 30 years, according to the Houston Chronicle. \nShe also is eligible for deferred adjudication, in which case she will be placed on probation and will have no felony on her record if she successfully completes the terms, the Houston Chronicle reported. \n\"We're very much hoping for deferred adjudication,\" Vera's attorney, Ricardo Rodriguez, said, according to the Houston Chronicle.

She said she initially resisted the boy's advances until sometime last fall, when she agreed to hang out with her student. \nProsecutors say Vera and the teen had sex almost every day for nine months. She told investigators that they love each other, according to court documents. During the relationship, Vera told her neighbors that the boy was her brother, according to KHOU, a CBS affiliate. \nThe boy's parents had known of the relationship since October of last year, and they accepted it, Vera told police. \nA police investigation began earlier this year after the school principal received a tip about Vera. She told police that she had gotten pregnant and had an abortion after Child Protective Services questioned her about the relationship in February, according to KTRK-TV, an ABC affiliate. \nVera has been free on a $100,000 bail and has been wearing a GPS ankle monitor. She's scheduled for a sentencing hearing in January. \nThe now-14-year-old boy, who also admitted to the sexual relationship, is in foster care and will remain there at least until August, according to KHOU. The boy's mother also was investigated by Child Protective Services, according to media reports. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

    "text": "\n. At least we finally got to play its broken, confusing battle system. Final Fantasy 15 \nTen years we waited for Final Fantasy 15. Ten years of rumors, speculation, and obsession over brief trailers for a game that started as a PlayStation 3 exclusive named Final Fantasy Versus 13. When it finally re-emerged as Final Fantasy 15 at E3 2013, we saw a trailer depicting a stunning fantasy world mixing hypermodern urban life with fantastic depictions of wildlife and magic. All of that culminated in this cover, a discarded poster for a male beauty pageant hosted by a Nick Lachey-less 98 Degrees and sponsored by L’Oreal. Where is the blonde guy even going? Everyone has to order you online, Final Fantasy 15, because they’ll be mortified buying you at a store. Final Fantasy 9 \nIn terms of cast lovability, Final Fantasy 9 ranks high in the series pantheon. There isn’t a dud among them. Zidane’s a classic lead, Vivi is the first personality behind the iconic black mage design, and Freya is almost Jim Hensonian in her warm mix of animal and human characteristics. Lumping them all together like this on the cover, though, captures none of the whimsy in their adventure. They look like a brochure for an online college where cosplay is a major. Sign up today and you too can learn to make Amarant wigs! Final Fantasy 8 \nAnother example of how Final Fantasy would have been better served by sticking to its original cover art. Final Fantasy 8 is a very, very strange story about a witch from the future trying to take over the world by compressing the past and the future into a single time. And teenagers falling in love. Right. Chew on that. , we get an 8th grader’s attempt at sexy stoicism. Ease down on the lavender and we’ll all get through this, kid. Final Fantasy 14 \nThings are starting to improve, but not by much with Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn. (We’re going with A Realm Reborn rather than the original Final Fantasy 14 because, much like Square-Enix and its shareholders, we’re trying to forget it ever happened.) On the bright side, the Final Fantasy Judge is a remarkable piece of character design which is striking on its own even if it doesn’t evoke the broad swath of experiences in this MMO. On the other side, Cool Guy With Sword is a pretty generic video game cover theme. Final Fantasy 11 \nThe original Final Fantasy MMO definitely did a better job at capturing the spirit of the series. The plain white background with concept artist Yoshitaka Amano’s logo depicting a united, ephemeral band of adventurers is stirring. The bizarre amalgam of cutscene screenshots and logos beneath it undercut any sense of budding majesty, though. All these years later, the cover is as much a monument to hilariously named internet services like PlayOnline as it as a work of art. Final Fantasy 5 \nNow we come to the good stuff. Final Fantasy 5, another early entry that waited until the Game Boy Advance to come west, benefits from a cover that’s far more romantic than the game itself. This is, after all, a game about a guy named Buttz whose best friend is a giant chicken and your mission is to fight random battle after random battle so he can slowly learn barely distinguishable jobs. Amano’s delicate characters on the cover, though, hint at a wispy world where even dudes named Buttz can be heartthrobs. Final Fantasy 3 \nWhat Final Fantasy 2 got so wrong, Final Fantasy 3 gets very right. Plain, graceful, and breathtaking, the Final Fantasy 3 cover for Nintendo DS is nearly perfect. The gorgeous logo captures how basic the game itself is. The original version on NES marked the first appearance of the Job System, where you train up characters in different vocations that can change as you go. That’s pretty much all there is to it. From a story perspective, it’s even straightforward good-versus-evil stuff than the first game. Beautiful and simple. Final Fantasy \nWhen Final Fantasy came out in 1990, the world still hadn’t gotten on board with JRPGs. Role-playing adventures were still largely stuck in 1970s Dungeons and Dragons mode, which is no bad thing. Everyone likes burly men and women wearing fur thongs in muddy landscapes. This cover graces up against that sort of Monster Guide territory with its big medieval weapons and crystal balls thing, but there’s a subtle quality to it that still feels distinctly Final Fantasy. It remains iconic even as the series’ more gossamer characteristics have come to the fore. Final Fantasy 12 \nOne of the primary criticisms leveled against Final Fantasy 12 by haters is that “it’s just weird Star Wars.” Is it really a criticism when the game clearly knows that it’s just riffing on the plot of the 1977 space opera? Even the cover apes the classic movie posters of Drew Struzan, combining the game’s cast and its ethereal world design into a pyramid like collage of romantic imagery. In the same way Sturzan arranged George Lucas characters to maximum effect, Final Fantasy 12’s cover pulls you into its Star Wars But Super Manga Sexy world. Just look at that sepia toned Balthier and Fran and tell me you don’t want to know about the hottest version of Han Solo and Chewbacca ever. Final Fantasy 7 \nWith the exception of the occasionally mangled English script, Square got everything right about Final Fantasy 7’s release in the West. Decades later, it’s still the nucleus of RPG fandom around the world because of its batshit story, iconic characters, amazing music, and sumptuous art. The American cover is arguably the best version, a ghostly but still vivid rendering of Cloud Strife as he stares up at the Shinra mako reactor, a classical depiction of resistance against corrupted power. It nails both the game’s nature as a technological showcase and as an environmentally conscious science fiction romance. Final Fantasy 4 \nThe first time around in the West, Final Fantasy 4 was called Final Fantasy 2, its difficulty was halved, and most of its characters lost their specialized abilities in an attempt to make the game more accessible. It also got a cover that was ust a logo against an angry red background . Not bad, but it doesn’t exactly embody a story where the hero has to literally fight the evil in his soul before flying a dwarven spaceship to the freaking moon. Many years later, Final Fantasy 4 made it to the US in an unedited, expanded form called Final Fantasy 4 Advance and it brought with it not just the sketched figure work of Yoshitaka Amano but a full, brand new painting. The thick color, angular bodies, and otherworldly faces capture everything about Final Fantasy 4 that’s kept people playing it for a quarter of a century. Final Fantasy 6 \nSo that Final Fantasy 3 SNES art we linked to above is pretty terrible. Our own Connor Sheridan described it as the crappy art on the side of a county fair haunted house. When it returned to the West appropriately named Final Fantasy 6 as part of the Final Fantasy Anthology, that mistake was remedied, and how. While Yoshitaka Amano’s logos and characters have appeared on other covers, Final Fantasy 6 marks the first time that one of his concept art landscapes made it to the cover as well. This portrait of Terra atop her Magitek armor before one of the game’s impossible cities actually manages to encapsulate everything Final Fantasy is at its best, an expert blend of sci-fi, fantasy, romance, and something wholly unique and strange that belongs just to this series. It’s sexy and strong, familiar and distant, all at the same time.

    "text": "Saskatchewan's universities are figuring out how to handle a budget cut with just a few months left in their fiscal years.\nThe province released its mid-year financial update Tuesday, and with it came $11.7 million of cuts to the Ministry of Advanced Education.\nSask. now projects $1B deficit for 2016-17 \nThe cuts include $9.3 million of reduced grants to post-secondary institutions, $1.5 million of money not yet allocated for preventative maintenance and renewal funding, $400,000 to post-secondary projects and $500,000 in administrative costs.\nAs for the institutions themselves, the University of Saskatchewan will see reductions of $5 million, the University of Regina will see $1.7 million, Saskatchewan Polytechnic faces $1.8 million and all other institutions will see $800,000.\nU of R to look for more savings University of Regina President and Vice-Chancellor Vianne Timmons said while they understand the financial situation the province is currently in, facing a cut now is especially challenging.\n\"To get the cut and absorb it within three months of an academic year, that's all we have left. It's going to be tough.\"\nThe university faces a $1.1-million reduction to its operating budget, a $300,000 clawback of a Workers' Compensation Board surplus rebate and a $275,000 cut to preventative maintenance.\nTimmons said the U of R hasn't received sufficient funding to balance its budget in the last few years. Increased enrolments helped the university absorb cuts last year, but Timmons said that likely won't happen this time.\n\"Every year we've gone in, looking for efficiencies and areas we can cut, and this will be another one.\"\nIf savings can't be found, Timmons said the university may have to go to its campuses to claw back funding.\nTimmons said the overall goal will be to make sure there is minimal impact to students, staff and faculty due to the cuts.\nU of S to draw from reserves At the University of Saskatchewan, the $5 million reduction is one that Michael Atkinson said can be absorbed out of the institution's reserves.\n\"This is why we have some reserves, to avoid that kind of forced deficit situation,\" said the interim provost and vice-president of academics.\nThe university faces a $3.1-million reduction to its operating budget, a $1.2-million clawback of a Workers' Compensation Board surplus rebate and a $720,000 cut to preventative maintenance.\nAtkinson also acknowledged the difficult situation the province is in financially, but he said he doesn't think universities will suffer down the road.\n\"There would be a concern if this was a long-term cut to the institution. But as we understand it, this is a one-time reduction in our budget for the fiscal year.\"",

    "text": "Why. Photo: WB \nI have a lot of problems with the television series you all know and love as Gilmore Girls . Lorelai and Rory are the actual worst . No one on this planet has ever spoken like Jess Mariano. Emily Gilmore is a queen and no one treats her as such. But perhaps my biggest issue with this show is the glaring eyesore of the title. Why on earth is that second \"g\" lowercase? Who was possessed to make such a structural error? Now, I never watched the show back in its original run, so I don’t have the same affection for the series as many my age do. And every damn time I watch this show it’s the first thing I think about, and I can’t shake the annoyance. To get to the bottom of this I did some significant research (read: Googling) and all I could find was this very short Reddit thread . So in lieu of an actual investigation, here are my best guesses at why the show chose this maddening grammatical faux pas for its title. \nTo represent the mother-daughter relationship. \nBig G, little G, big Lorelai, little Lorelai. The show is ostensibly about the power of love between a mother and daughter, but I think the series is really about a Connecticut grand dame who can’t get anyone to appreciate her dinner parties. This is the most obvious reason, but I think there’s another answer.\nTo illustrate the quirkiness of Stars Hollow. \nA pancake house that doesn’t sell pancakes. “Annual” traditions that only appear once over the course of seven years. A gazebo. This town is so wacky! Only a title so annoyingly incorrect would do for a town as ~unconventional~ as our dear setting.\nThe WB was trying to be hip. \nIn an effort to capture the elusive teen audience, the network tried speaking in AOL chat jargon. The original titled was actually GiLmOrE gIrLz.\nThe G’s growth was stunted from too much caffeine. \nFive cups a day really does affect your health.\nKirk was in charge of the title design and he forget to hit caps lock. \nJust like the forgotten Easter egg map before it, naming the show was a task Kirk was just not up for.\nThere was a budget issue. \nThe show spent so much money on the rights to Carole King’s seminal “Where You Lead” that there was no money left for a second capital G.\nHollywood’s oppressive gender wage gap. \nA much younger G was brought in to play alongside the veteran capital G to add some moxie. \nThe second capital G got lost trying to escape one of Amy Sherman-Palladino’s hats . \nThey are cavernous.\nThe first G requested she be the only capital in her contract. \nA notorious diva.",

RUGABER, The Associated Press 1:02 p.m. EST November 27, 2016 President-elect Donald Trump speaks during his meeting with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. Trump promised big tax cuts for the middle class, but for nearly 8 million families, the opposite would occur: They’d pay more. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP) \nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump's proposals would modestly cut income taxes for most middle-class Americans. But for nearly 8 million families — including a majority of single-parent households — the opposite would occur: They'd pay more. \nMost married couples with three or more children would also pay higher taxes, an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found. And while middle-class families as a whole would receive tax cuts of about 2 percent, they'd be dwarfed by the windfalls averaging 13.5 percent for America's richest 1 percent. \nTrump's campaign rhetoric had promoted the benefits of his proposals for middle-income Americans. \n\"The largest tax reductions are for the middle class,\" said Trump's \"Contract With the American Voter,\" released last month. \nThe tax hikes that would hit single parents and large families would result from Trump's plan to eliminate the personal exemption and the head-of-household filing status. These features of the tax code have enabled many Americans to reduce their taxable income. \nHis other proposed tax changes would benefit middle- and lower-income Americans. But they wouldn't be enough to offset those modifications. \n\"If you're a low- or moderate-income single parent, you're going to get hurt,\" said Bob Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center. \nUnlike Trump's polarizing proposals on immigration and trade, his tax plan is in line with traditional Republican policy. His steep tax cuts in many ways resemble those carried out by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, and the Republican-run Congress is expected to welcome them. \nDuring the campaign, Trump said his tax cuts — for individuals and companies — would energize the economy by boosting business investment in factories and equipment, while leaving consumers with more cash to spend. His proposals, he contended, would help create 25 million jobs over the next decade. \nBut Lily Batchelder, a visiting fellow at the Tax Policy Center and former deputy director of President Barack Obama's National Economic Council, estimates that roughly 7.9 million families with children would pay higher taxes under his proposals. About 5.8 million are led by single parents. An additional 2.1 million are married couples. \nOther analysts, including economists at the conservative Tax Foundation and right-of-center American Enterprise Institute, have agreed with Batchelder's conclusions. \nHere's what her analysis finds: \nRight now, a single parent with $75,000 in income and two children can claim a head of household deduction of $9,300, plus three personal exemptions. Those steps would reduce the household's taxable income by $21,450, to $53,550. \nTrump's plan would more than double the standard deduction to $15,000. But that change would be outweighed by his elimination of personal exemptions and head-of-household status. So the family's taxable income would be $60,000, and their tax bill would be $2,440 more than it is now. \nA married couple with four children and income of $50,000 would absorb a tax increase of $1,090 because of their loss of personal exemptions. \nKelly Rodriguez, 47, who lives in Tampa, Florida, voted for Trump and is a single mother who claims two of her four children as dependents. (Her ex-husband claims the other two.) She made roughly $90,000 last year, including alimony payments. Her taxes would likely rise under Trump's plan, according to Batchelder's analysis. \n\"I would want him to explain that to me,\" she said. \"Taxes have to make sense to the people paying them.\" \nStill, Trump's plan will likely evolve during congressional negotiations before it becomes law. \n\"This is not anywhere close to a final plan,\" Williams said. \nKyle Pomerlau, director of federal projects at the conservative Tax Foundation, noted that House Speaker Paul Ryan's own tax-cut proposal is similar to Trump's but wouldn't raise taxes on single-parent families. In theory, the two plans could be melded, and Trump's elimination of the head of household status could be dropped. \nBut leaving the head of household filing status and personal exemptions intact would lower tax revenue by $2.1 trillion over the next decade, the Tax Policy Center says. \nTrump's advisers deny that he will raise taxes on middle-income Americans but don't provide details. Previously, the campaign suggested that Trump would broadly instruct Congress to avoid raising taxes on lower- and middle-income workers. \n\"We will cut taxes massively for the middle class and working class and protect everyone in the middle class and working class,\" Stephen Miller, Trump's top policy adviser, said in an email. \nYet all independent analyses show most of the benefit flowing to the wealthiest Americans. Nearly half of Trump's tax cuts would go to the top 1 percent of earners, the Tax Policy Center found. Less than a quarter of the cuts would benefit the bottom 80 percent. \nTrump proposes to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent. That would slash the top rate from the current 39.6 percent. He would repeal the estate tax, which affects only about 0.2 percent of estates — those worth above $5.45 million. \nFor middle-income earners as a whole, the Trump proposals would cut taxes, even taking into account the increases on single-parent families. Those earning nearly $50,000 to about $83,000 — the middle one-fifth — would receive an average cut of $1,010, according to the Tax Policy Center. That would lift their after-tax incomes 1.8 percent. \nBy contrast, the wealthiest 1 percent — those earning over $700,000 — would enjoy a tax cut averaging nearly $215,000, boosting their after-tax incomes 13.5 percent. And the richest 0.1 percent — those making above $3.7 million — would receive a bonanza: An average tax cut exceeding $1 million. \n\"Trump's campaign rhetoric may have been populist, but his tax plan isn't,\" Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the policy center, wrote on its website. \nHis tax proposals suggest what may be a challenge for Trump's administration: Providing his middle- and working-class supporters with tangible signs of economic progress. Middle-income Americans already pay a relatively modest share of federal income taxes compared with the wealthy. That limits the scope of what tax cuts could do for them. \n\"The thing that he needs to worry about is making life better for his supporters, and that involves more than tax cuts,\" Williams said. \nMiddle class finances have also been squeezed by high and rising costs for health care, higher education and housing, noted Joseph Cohen, a sociologist at Queens College in New York City. \n\"We've been cutting taxes since Reagan, and things have been getting worse for the middle class since Reagan,\" he said.

If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nSaskatoon parents now have another option when it comes to their child’s education. For the first time ever in Saskatchewan, an elementary Montessori program is being operated by a school division. \nUnfamiliar with Montessori? It’s taught in thousands of classrooms around the world and this method is learning is all about freedom within limits. Saskatoon Public Schools plan to hire more French immersion teachers \n“Our students aren’t grouped in classes Grade 1, Grade 2 – they’re grouped in groupings of Grade 1, 2, 3 together so that children learn from one another,” Brent Hills, superintendent of education for Saskatoon Public Schools , said. \n“Children then have an opportunity to experience their learning as they’re ready for it as opposed to when the teacher is deciding this is now the time to learn.” \nREAD MORE: Saskatoon school boards experience rapid student growth \nThe classroom at City Park School that Global News visited didn’t have a desk for the teacher and each student quietly engaged in a different activity during what was noted on the whiteboard as “work cycle.” \n“Things are not divided up into subject areas. It’s not like the bell rings at 10 o’clock and everyone switches to math,” Dr. Grace Thomson, head of the School for Maria Montessori Preschool and Kindergarten, said. \n“They don’t have to do it at the same time so when you go into a Montessori classroom not only are the children multi-aged in there, you will also see them working at different things.” \nREAD MORE: Saskatoon Board of Education decides on names for new elementary schools \nWhile the Montessori program isn’t new to the province, a program being operated by a school division is. \n“There’s not a one size fits all for education for everybody and as a public education system we value that,” Hills said. \nSo in this specific case in Saskatoon, much of the programming is free as opposed to tuition-based. \n“It’s public education so it’s funded no differently than another special program or unique program in Saskatoon so our students in Grade 1 to Grade 8 don’t pay tuition.” \nREAD MORE: Saskatoon schools hope to train more teachers in treaty education \nMontessori tuition rates vary from institution to institution but parents in North America typically shell out any where from $1,000 to $14,000 a year. \nAt City Park School, tuition still applies to children in the early learning program aged two to five years old which is independently operated. \nOtherwise families with children in this newly integrated program are only on the hook for a small fee for resources and getting their child to and from school. \nAt this point, there isn’t a wait list for students but growing interest from parents who are considering the option next year. \n“It’s not about competition, it’s just about providing the opportunity for all families in Saskatoon to have a Montessori education if they choose to do so,” Hills said. \nThe success of the program will be reviewed and whether or not Montessori is integrated into other public schools in the district, that decision will be up to the board. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

    "text": "Benfica score against Besiktas after hitting woodwork three times Published 24/7 \nBesiktas came from three goals down to draw 3-3 with Benfica in an enthralling Champions League encounter on Wednesday. \nIt didn’t reach the level of Borussia Dortmund 8-4 win against Legia Warsaw the previous day - it’ll be a long time before another game does - but it provided enormous entertainment nonetheless. \nBenfica looked to have booked their place in the knockout round after scoring three goals in the first half but the Besiktas side bounced back in a game reminiscent of the 2005 Champions League final between Liverpool and AC Milan. Article continues below \nCenk Tosun reduced the deficit in the 58th minute but Besiktas had to wait until the 83rd minute to score again, Ricardo Quaresma scoring from the penalty spot. \nThe comeback was complete when Quaresma sent in a brilliant rabona cross that was turned in by Vincent Aboubakar in the 89th minute. Article continues below Cristiano Ronaldo awarded incredible new FIFA 17 card after Atletico hat-trick \nBesiktas must have thought it was just not their day when Ljubomir Fejsa scored Benfica’s third goal in bizarre circumstances. \nThe midfielder steered the ball home after his teammates struck the woodwork not once, not twice but three times. \nIn Benfica’s case, it was fourth time lucky. \nWatch the goal below. \nThe Portuguese outfit’s side luck ran out in the second half when they completely capitulated. Hamann: Nobody gave Liverpool a chance \nDidi Hamann, who was a part of the Liverpool team that beat Milan on penalties after recovering a 3-0 half-time deficit, was instantly reminded of that night in Istanbul. \n\"They were probably given as much chance as people had given us 11 years ago,\" Hamann told RTE, via Goal . \n\"But what a remarkable comeback. It started with an absolute screamer of a goal. Tosun with a great bicycle kick, then Quaresma with a penalty, and then look at that rabona! What a cross, he puts it in on a sixpence to Aboubakar, and he finishes off.” Quaresma's assist \nHamann certainly isn’t underselling Quaresma’s assist. Check it out below. Group B is finely poised \nThe result, couple with Napoli’s 0-0 draw against Dynamo Kiev, leaves Group B finely poised. Benfica and Napoli lead the way on eight points each but they take each other on in the final group game. Besiktas, on seven points, will fancy their chances of beating bottom-placed Kiev and reaching the last-16. \n\"At half-time they're nearly down and out because you're expecting Napoli to beat Kiev, but now they're right back in it,” Hamann added. “It's in their hands now. It would be a remarkable achievement after the first-half.\" What's the craziest goal you've seen? Let us know in the comments section below! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

ADVERTISEMENT \nReactions of “Aaaw” and “Ayiiii” reverberated in the room as Dayan told the story of how his affair with De Lima developed in 2007 until their breakup in 2015. \nMajority leader Ilocos Norte Rep. Rudy Fariñas added fuel to the fire when he asked Dayan to describe the level of his passion during the relationship with De Lima. \nAs Dayan recounted the times he received alleged kickbacks from alleged Eastern Visayas drug lord Kerwin Espinosa for De Lima, Fariñas took the opportunity to pander on the details of the affair. \n“Nung panahong yan, malakas pa pag-iibigan niyo o humina na?” Fariñas said. \n“Medyo signal number one na po sir,” Dayan responded, to the jeers of the audience. READ: Dayan recounts ‘breakup’ with De Lima \nFariñas then asked the extent of their relationship, to which Dayan said his passion for De Lima reached up to “signal number five.” \n“Umabot din siguro ng signal number five, sir,” Dayan said, during which Dela Rosa slumped to his seat laughing with his palms on his face. \nDeputy speaker Capiz Rep. Fredenil Castro was next in the interpellation and took from Fariñas’ line of questioning on digging into details of Dayan and De Lima’s affair. \n“Ginoong Dayan, sa inyong relasyon ni Senador, masasabi mo bang ang iyong pag-ibig ay dalisay?” Castro said. \nEliciting guffaws from the audience, Dayan answered: “Ang pag-ibig ko na tapat ay di isinukli.” \nWhen Castro asked him if he would be willing to let go of his love for De Lima, Dayan said: “Alang alang sa batas, sa katotohanan, kaya ko siyang ipagkanulo.” \nAsked why he acted as bagman for De Lima despite knowing that he was dealing with an alleged drug lord (Espinosa), Dayan said” “Nagawa ko po yan dahil sa pagmamahal ko sa kaniya.” \nCastro finished his interpellation when he asked Dayan if the latter transacted for De Lima in exchange for “init ng katawan,” to which Dayan reluctantly said no. \n“Hindi ko alam na delikado makipagkita kay Kerwin,” Dayan said. \nDayan had admitted delivering money from Espinosa to De Lima amid their romantic relationship. \nDayan has said he gave drug money from Espinosa for De Lima at least five times in 2014. Espinosa however said he gave De Lima at least P8 million in 2015 for the justice secretary’s senatorial campaign. \nDayan was arrested in La Union 11:30 a.m. Tuesday after he was cited in contempt for snubbing the House of Representatives inquiry in aid of legislation on the proliferation of drugs at the New Bilibid Prison implicating De Lima.

    "text": "\nto receive USC News via email subscribe Social Impact Architecture students design houses for L.A.’s homeless Trojans apply their skills to social ills, designing prototypes for temporary shelters that could work in the real world BY Joanna Clay November 29, 2016 \nWhen architecture student Jayson Champlain set out to build his first house, he didn’t go to vendors or Home Depot. \nHe went to Vernon — scavenging items outside warehouses and in the garbage. \n“One of the things we wanted to find was … an old truck camper shell,” Champlain said. “Luckily, we found one by the train tracks in Vernon, flipped up on the side of the road.” \nThe tiny house — with the shell for a roof — was built in the Madworkshop Homeless Studio at the USC School of Architecture. \nIn just a few months, a class of 11 fourth-year students came up with designs and prototypes for temporary homeless housing — from do-it-yourself nomadic designs, such as a bed that folds out of a shopping cart to tiny homes built with scavenged goods to a 92-square-foot prefabricated unit with built-in furniture. \nAnd they could see their work in the real world. \nMost recently, the class has been working with the city of Los Angeles and the nonprofit Hope of the Valley to create the prefabricated units for a 30-bed senior women’s shelter in the San Fernando Valley — a region that’s seen a 35 percent increase in homelessness in the last 12 months, said Hope of the Valley CEO Ken Craft. \n“We’re getting firsthand experience showing that architecture isn’t just for those who can afford it,” said Aleksandr Drabovskiy, “that it can be something that creates social good and changes the way people live their lives.” Funding found \nThe course was funded by a grant from Santa Monica-based Madworkshop, a design education nonprofit. Professors Sofia Borges and Scott Mitchell are director and board member at the organization, respectively. About the faculty Sofia Borges \nBesides being a professor at USC, she’s an architecture writer and editor, publishing numerous book titles for publisher Gestalten. This year, she exhibited a photography project at USC called “(Home)less.” Dedicated to her brother, she laid images of structures over photos of homeless living on the streets, highlighting how the “power of environment shapes how others see us.” Scott Mitchell \nHe is known for his experience in fabrication as well as design. He’s worked for Trojan Frank Gehry and is the owner of Los Angeles-based design-build company Gigante AG. \nThe course wanted to address the issue of temporary housing — the gap between living on the streets and living in permanent supportive housing. \n“It can take two years to get in permanent housing,” Mitchell said. “We’re trying to get people off the street immediately.” \nThe workshop not only got the students thinking about applying their skills to social ills — but, for the majority, it was their first time building anything. \n“They’re master builders now,” Borges said with a laugh. A trio of projects \nThe workshop was broken up into three projects. There were mobile shelters made for street living, such as the shopping cart model or carts that fold out with beds and desks. Then there were the tiny houses, which they built in a week using scavenged materials they found all over Los Angeles — incorporating everything from refrigerators to screen doors. Both got them thinking of the needs of the homeless. \nLastly were the prefabricated units, which are intended to be easily mass-produced and transportable by truck and used on under-utilized land in Los Angeles, such as land that is yet to be developed. There would be an agreement, like a land lease, and then the units could be moved to a new location when development starts. \n“It’s wonderful because it utilizes empty vacant land that otherwise is just sitting there,” Craft said. “Why not come up with a creative solution so that human beings have a place to sleep?” On the rise \nHomelessness has increased across Los Angeles County, but shelters are limited. For this reason, the county estimates 70 percent of the homeless are unsheltered, meaning they sleep on the streets or in tents. \nIn the San Fernando Valley alone, there are roughly 5,000 homeless people with only 900 beds to sleep in, Craft said. \nThe city of Los Angeles doesn’t require a conditional use permit for shelters of 30 beds or less, eliminating the need for community hearings, which means the shelter concept could be easily replicated and quickly, Mitchell said. The units would be pre-certified by the city. \nThe students have taken the reigns, scouting for land for the Valley shelter, finding a spot in Canoga Park. Right now, the nonprofit is looking to raise funds to negotiate the land lease and build the units, which Borges estimates would cost around $25,000 each. \nFor Borges, leading this class is a source of pride. Her brother, Daren, was homeless in Northern California, living off and on the streets for roughly 20 years. He died a couple years ago at the age of 42. \nShe hopes students realize their potential to help society with their work. \n“With doctors, you take an oath to help everyone and I think as architects we should take a similar pledge,” Borges said. “We have the ability to create housing, create shelter — typically we do that for the most fortunate among us, rather than the least.” \nOn Dec. 7, the class is presenting a prototype of the units they propose for Hope of the Valley. They invited Midnight Mission, Downtown Women’s Center, Skid Row Housing Trust and the city’s Department of Building and Safety with the hope that one day, the units can be all over Los Angeles.

    "text": "Follow @ZeeNews \nZee Media Bureau \nMumbai: Credai, the realtor's body, on Saturday said that housing prices unlikely to come down in primary market post demonetisation since rates are already at the lowest level. \nCredai , however, supported the decision of note ban and said that the decision will help in eliminating black money, corruption, fake currency and terror financing. \nThe association in a statement said that the primary market is funded by banks and financial institutions which are all regulated entities. As such, cash component is not an integral element of the primary market. \nTherefore, Credai denies adverse impact on the primary real estate market arising out of demonetisation . In fact, the primary segment is expected to gain at a rate of 15 per cent YoY, the statement said. \nThe government's resolve to eliminate black money and corruption is in the interest of the common man as well as business and industry, it said. \nReal estate industry contributes 7 per cent of country's GDP and is the second biggest employer after agriculture. Given the scale and size of the industry, it is imperative that Credai articulates the impact of demonetisation on the industry and brings it to the knowledge of the general public, it said. \nIn the aftermath of demonetisation move, banks are going to have additional funds upward of Rs 10 trillion. Hence, a fall in interest rates up to 200 basis points is expected. \nAn early sign is seen with country's largest lender State Bank of India cutting its deposit rates by 1.75 per cent. \nAccording to Credai, we see home loan rates coming down from the present level of 9.25 per cent to less than 7 per cent in less than one year from now. This would bring down the EMI for the ultimate consumers. \nCredai expects the mop up of black money to also lead to higher tax collection and a lower rate of personal and corporate income tax from the next financial year onwards. In other words, the demonetisation would put more money into the pocket of home purchasers through lower tax burden and incentives for home ownership. \nThe tendency towards lower rate of interest is also going to be strengthened by a low rate of inflation. \nCredai, comprising 11,500 real estate developers spread over 166 cities in 23 states in the country, is the apex body for private real estate developers in the country. \n(PTI inputs) ",

    "text": "Kashmir rights activist Khurram Pervez Even after J&K High Court on Friday termed the detention of human rights activist Khurram Parvez under Public safety Act “not only illegal” but “abuse of power” and ordered J&K Government to release him, Parvez is still in prison. The reason: a minor error in the date of the issue of PSA warrant at one place in the order. Superintendent of Kotbalwal Jail Dinesh Sharma told The Indian Express “there was a minor clerical mistake in the (court) order and we will release him (Parvez) as soon as it is rectified”. Director General of Prisons S K Mishra said he can’t comment because he hasn’t received any order. “As soon as the jail receives the order, they will release (him),” he said. J&K’s Home Secretary Home R K Goel said he will have to check. “I haven’t received any order,” he said.\n“The High Court hasn’t just ordered his release, it has questioned the detention itself,” a close relative of Parvez told The Indian Express. “We have been waiting for his release since Friday when the court order was issued. Today, the jail authorities told us that they cannot release him because there is a minor error in the order”. He said “at one place in the order, the date of the issue of the PSA warrant against him (Parvez) has been put as September 19 instead of September 21”. “The jail authorities called it a minor error but wanted the Home department to disregard this small issue and tell them to release him. That didn’t happen. Now we will have to approach the Court again to issue a fresh order to correct this error,” he said. The PSA warrant was issued on September 21 while this warrant was based on a dossier of the Senior Superintendent Police issued on September 19.\nThe J&K Police had picked up Parvez from his home in Srinagar on September 16, a day after he was disallowed to board a Geneva bound flight at Delhi as he was on his way to attend United Nations Human Rights Council session and was subsequently booked under PSA and imprisoned at Kotbalwal jail in Jammu.\nJustice Muzaffar Hussain Attar while ordering Parvez’s release had said that District Magistrate Srinagar Farooq Ahmad Lone has “arbitrarily” ordered his detention and “nothing is brought into the notice of the Court” to show that “involvement of the detenue (has) surfaced as an accused” in the FIRs mentioned in the grounds of detention. “…he (Detaining Authority) has not been sure whether the activities of the detenue were prejudicial to the security of the State or maintenance of public order and has, thus, arbitrarily, ordered for detention…It also shows that the detention order suffers from lack of application of mind on the part of the Detaining Authority,” the order said. “Though it is the duty of the State and its authorities to maintain peace in the society but it is equally their responsibility to ensure that laws, which they invoke to achieve such purpose, are followed and complied with honestly”.\nReferring to Public Safety Act, Justice Attar had said “a society which has catapulted itself to the highest position of democratic values and principles, may not accept the law like the Act of 1978”. Saying that Parvez’s detention order “is not only illegal but the Detaining Authority has abused its powers in ordering his (Parvez’s) detention, the Court said that “…….perusal of the FIR’s…. show that in none of these FIRs, the detenue (Parvez) has been named as an accused”.\n“Nothing is brought to the notice of the Court, either in the grounds of detention or in the Reply Affadavit, that in the investigation of these FIRs, involvement of the detnue (Parvez) surfaced as an accused,” the Court said.\nThe Court had also raised serious questions about the police case against Parvez that led to his arrest initially, saying that the police witnesses “made parrot-like statements”, gave wrong parentage and address of Parvez and also didn’t provide the content of the slogans that they accused Parvez had instigated people to make. The Court also said that (Detaining Authority) has not been sure whether the activities of the detenue were prejudicial to the security of the State or maintenance of public order,” Justice Muzzafar Hussain Attar said in the order.\n© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

    "text": "The Latest on Deep South severe weather (all times local): 10:15 p.m. Emergency officials in Tennessee say a wildfire has set 30 structures ablaze in Gatlinburg, including a 16-story hotel, and is at the edge of the Dollywood theme park. Tennessee Emergency Management Agency spokesman Dean Flener says in a news release Monday night that mandatory evacuations were underway for areas in and around Gatlinburg, including the south part of Pigeon Forge, where Dolly Parton's theme park is. Flener says strong afternoon winds fanned the wildfire on land in the great Smoky Mountains National Park to move quickly onto private property. TEMA says no deaths have been reported. ——— 7:45 p.m. Officials say several areas are being evacuated because of fires in and around Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Gatlinburg police had been going door to door in one neighborhood asking for voluntary evacuations. But the Knoxville News Sentinel reported that as wind picked up and fallen trees sparked fires from downed lines, Gatlinburg fire officials declared a mandatory evacuation of a larger area. The newspaper said some park employees were also evacuating and some locations closed. A news release from the Gatlinburg Chamber of Commerce said the National Park Service reported more fire growth expected in the park with spot fires possibly forming outside the main area. ——— 6:45 p.m. Roaring winds have been followed by an inch or more of rain across much of Mississippi Monday but not enough to break a months-long drought. National Weather Service meteorologist Eric Carpenter says areas of northeast Louisiana and Mississippi's Delta region got more than an inch, and parts of central and northeast Mississippi were also likely to reach that total. As of last week, more than 70 percent of the state was classified as being in extreme drought. Trees were reported downed in nearly 20 counties across the state, with gusts of more than 50 mph in multiple locations. Power outages peaked at more than 23,000 statewide. Mississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesman Greg Flynn says powerlines downed by winds sparked grass fires in four central Mississippi counties. Though at least one tornado warning was posted, for Noxubee County, Carpenter says no tornadoes were confirmed by early Monday evening. ——— 5:15 p.m. A storm system moving across the South announced itself in Mississippi with hours of wind before heavy rains arrived. Damage was light, but trees were reported down in at least eight counties, including one that fell on the town hall in the 100-resident hamlet of Eden in the state's Delta region. Yazoo County Emergency Management Director Jack Willingham says the metal building is damaged beyond repair, but no one was injured. Photos taken by Willingham show a tree branch plunged through the roof. Statewide, power outages rose to nearly 23,000 by 5 p.m., with the heaviest numbers around Jackson and in Tallahatchie County. Forecasters say a threat of strong wind and possibly an isolated tornado persists through the evening. More than 2 inches of rain fell in some areas. ——— 3:30 p.m. Fire officials say a storm system moving across the South appears to be heading toward many of the largest ongoing wildfires and will help suppress them. However, authorities say the rain moving across parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Tennessee on Monday likely won't end the fire threat and dangers posed by the blazes. Several of the largest fires are in Georgia and North Carolina. Dave Martin of the U.S. Forest Service says high winds on the leading edge of the front could topple dead trees and put firefighters in danger. But Martin said the rains will certainly help the overall situation. Forest Service spokesman Adam Rondeau says there are 24 large wildfires now burning throughout the southern U.S., covering about 133,000 acres. ——— 1:30 p.m. More than 14,000 customers are without power in Mississippi as heavy winds accompany rain into the state. Outages are concentrated in central and southeast Mississippi, according to power providers. Entergy Corp., Mississippi's single largest utility, reported 6,800 users without power Monday afternoon, with the largest numbers in Rankin and Hinds counties. Southern Pine Electric Power Association reported 4,500 customers without power, mostly in Copiah, Scott and Smith counties. Sustained winds above 20 mph were being reported at Jackson International Airport and Meridian's Key Field. A gust of 54 mph was reported Monday morning at Clarksdale. ——— 12:35 p.m. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, has issued a tornado watch for western and northern Louisiana. The watch is in effect until 5 p.m. Monday. The weather service says thunderstorms will slowly increase in coverage and intensity through the afternoon and spreading into northwest Louisiana. Forecasters say the storm environment will become more favorable for supercells with the potential to produce a few tornadoes. A tornado watch means conditions are favorable for tornadoes to form. ——— 9:05 a.m. Most of the Deep South is under the threat of severe weather through Wednesday. The Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, says a cold front approaching Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia will bring thunderstorms to the region. The weather service says damaging winds will be the primary threat, with tornadoes also possible. Some storms could produce possibly severe hail. Northern Louisiana and northern Mississippi will see gusty winds of up to 40 mph and brief heavy downpours on Monday. Rainfall amounts will average a quarter to half of an inch, with isolated higher amounts of up to an inch possible. The weather service says the rain water should be soaked up quickly because of severe drought conditions across the Deep South. 0 Shares",

    "text": "9 COMMENTS Breitbart News is asking its readers to boycott Kellogg Co. after the cereal maker said it would no longer advertise on the conservative news website.\nIn a post on Breitbart News on Wednesday, the publication called on readers to sign a #DumpKelloggs petition against the manufacturer, whose brands include Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies and Cheez-It.\nKellogg on Tuesday said it would pull its ads from Breitbart News after consumers notified the manufacturer that its products were appearing on the site. A company spokesperson told the Associated Press , “We regularly work with our media buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren’t aligned with our values as a company.”\nBreitbart fought back hard. “Boycotting Breitbart News for presenting mainstream American ideas is an act of discrimination and intense prejudice,” Alexander Marlow, Breitbart News editor-in-chief, said in the Breitbart News article.\nThe anti-Kellogg petition accused Kellogg of trying to “placate left-wing totalitarians.”\nIn a statement, Kellogg said, “To be clear, our decision had nothing to do with politics.”\nBreitbart News, a hard-right site know for scorched-earth populism, has been popular with the “alt right,” portraying immigration and multiculturalism as threats. The site’s critics say it has explicitly embraced white nationalism.\nThe site’s former chairman, Stephen Bannon, helped run Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and is now poised to become one of the president elect’s top advisers in the White House. Since the election and Mr. Bannon’s appointment, scrutiny of Breitbart has intensified.\nAds appear across the internet thanks to a complex web of third-party services, and brands often do not know where their ads will end up. The Kellogg spokesperson told the AP that “there is a very large volume of websites, so occasionally something is inadvertently missed.”\nLast week, online-advertising company AppNexus said it would stop letting Breitbart News use its ad-serving tools because the site violated the ad tech company’s hate speech terms, Bloomberg reported.\nOther brands, including Allstate, Nest, EarthLink, Warby Parker and SoFi, have also blacklisted Breitbart from showing their ads, Digiday reported.\nWrite to Steven Perlberg at steven.perlberg@wsj.com",

    "text": "Drag according to your convenience ET NOW RADIO ET NOW TIMES NOW If you don't talk to Pakistan, you give terrorists and sponsors what they want: Former NSA By IANS   04.39   Shivshankar Menon | Sartaj Aziz | NSA | National Security Advisor \"It is not going to change the mind of the Pakistan Army which sponsors this cross-border terrorism or the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) or the jihadi tanzeems who undertake it, nor is it going to destroy their infrastructure or the courses they espouse and what motivates them. That is not going to change.\" NEW DELHI: India's former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon says there is no alternative to talking to Pakistan to resolve outstanding issues because not talking is to allow terrorists to have a \"veto on the relationship\" and submitting to the \"agenda of terrorists and their sponsors\". \"If you don't talk, you are actually giving the terrorists and their sponsors what they want, because they don't want talks... They want to control the dialogue. They want to have a veto on the relationship. So, I don't see why you should allow them to do that,\" Menon, who also served as Foreign Secretary and ambassador to important capitals, including Islamabad and Beijing, told IANS in a chat ahead of the formal launch of his book, \"Choices - Inside the Making of India's Foreign Policy\" (Penguin Random House). \"Talking doesn't mean you don't do the other things necessary to deal with the terrorists. You have to eliminate the terrorists, do what a state is supposed to do. \"But that also doesn't mean you stop talking. If you have an opportunity, do talk, and you have a lot to say... you do want the ceasefire to be restored, you don't want the standoff in the relationship with cross-border terrorism going on and on... and a lot of this with the support of the Pakistani state, and elements of the Pakistani state. \"We need to raise this and talk to them about it,\" Menon stated. He was speaking in the context of reports that Sartaj Aziz , Pakistan's foreign policy adviser, was coming to Amritsar early next month to attend the multinational 'Heart of Asia' conference on Afghanistan, raising questions about whether or not there should be bilateral talks between the two countries to break the ice following the Uri terror attack that left 19 Indian soldiers dead in September and a reprisal strike inside Pakistan by Indian Special Forces. Menon thinks use of application of military force -- or \"surgical strikes\" as India's cross-border action against \"terror launchpads\" in Pakistan were described -- had \"limited utility\". \"It is not going to change the mind of the Pakistan Army which sponsors this cross-border terrorism or the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) or the jihadi tanzeems who undertake it, nor is it going to destroy their infrastructure or the courses they espouse and what motivates them. That is not going to change.\" He said any way the tanzeems \"seek martydom\" and are not afraid to die. Menon reiterated that \"covert cross-border action\" had been undertaken by the previous administration too, but the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh decided not to go public with it as these strikes were more focused on outcomes rather than on influencing public opinion. \"If your goal is to effect public opinion at home, you have to deal with its consequences,\" said Menon, adding that these often raised public expectations of results and then \"control of escalation becomes a challenge\". \"The moment you go public, then these (expected outcomes) are unlikely to happen because then both sides' faces are involved. Both sides have to show that they have not been deterred or frightened.\" He said the Manmohan Singh \"kept quiet for a reason\" on the covert actions that were undertaken \"and the reasons (for not publicising them) are still valid\". Menon said the dilemma of dealing with Pakistan was that \"there was not one Pakistan\" as there were \"large portions of Pakistani society that was not inimical to India\". In his book, Menon says that \"an Indian policymaker must deal with several Pakistans -- with civil society, the Pakistani business community, civilian politicians, the army and the ISI, and the religious right (which extends from political parties to jihadi tanzeems). \"Not all of these Pakistans have the same attitude towards India, and each responds and acts differently towards India and Indians.\" He said thanks to \"Pakistan's decline into irrelevance, Indian motives to address India-Pakistan issues are diminishing. The tragedy is that Pakistan is increasingly becoming a single-issue country in Indian discourse, and that issue is the zero-sum one of security\". And, he says, as Pakistan becomes ever closer and more tied to China, \"India-Pakistan relations will bear the imprint and will probably pay the price\". The book, to be released by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, deals with difficult decisions in foreign policy and national security faced by India's government leaders and the choices they are often forced to make in the existing circumstances.

    "text": "Map: Kambalda 6442 \nA herd of feral goats that has plagued a Western Australian mining town for the better part of 2016 has been rounded up, despite a determined effort to sabotage the operation by some locals. Photo: Mr Hansen says Kambalda locals deliberately unlocked this pen, releasing 20 feral goats back into the wild. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Sam Tomlin) \nThe herd of around 300 goats has been wandering in and out of Kambalda, 50 kilometres south of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, for most of the year. \nComplaints of ravaged gardens and damaged property, as well as restrictions on council rangers' ability to deal with the animals, prompted the Shire of Coolgardie to bring in contract musterer Paul Hansen to round up the animals. \nBut despite successfully capturing 170 of the goats, Mr Hansen said locals had attempted to sabotage his work. \n\"The very first evening, I managed to get a mob into the yard, spoke to the responsible people and asked to leave the goats there,\" Mr Hansen said. \n\"But I went back the next day and that mob was gone.\" \nA further 20 goats had been set free the day ABC Local spoke to Mr Hansen, this time from a pen around 5 kilometres east of Kambalda. \nTyre tracks were visible leading up to and away from the empty pen. \n\"It was holding goats last night, but some kind person has come along and released them [and] it makes it almost impossible to recapture them,\" Mr Hansen said. Photo: Contract musterer Paul Hansen came from western New South Wales to deal with Kambalda's goat problem. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Sam Tomlin) Wild dogs, rough terrain make for tricky muster \nBased in western New South Wales, Mr Hansen took the Kambalda job on the recommendation of a friend who works in the local mines. \nWorking with offsider Mick King, the men used a motorbike and team of six dogs to flush the goats out and round them up. \n\"I though it was a busman's holiday, so I thought I'd come over and have a look,\" Mr Hansen said. \nHaving worked with livestock for most of his life, he said the unusual behaviour of the Kambalda goats made them particularly challenging to deal with. \n\"Here it's a little bit different — they see a dog and it's either attack mode, or flat out in reverse,\" Mr Hansen said. \n\"I've had a couple of dogs lifted by billies; one was lifted a metre and a half off the ground. \n\"Some of these fellas must be 10 or 11 years old. They're big and they've never been handled.\" \nHe said he believed the presence of wild dogs in the area was the reason behind the animals hostility and flightiness. Photo: Rolly the dog was one of a team of canines assisting Mr Hansen and offsider Mick King with rounding up the goats. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Sam Tomlin) Some residents happy for goats to stay \nBack in Kambalda East, where the goats did the bulk of their reported damage, locals were surprisingly divided over the issue. \nWhile complaints from residents forced the local council to act, long-time resident Jenny Milbourne said the animals should remain. \nShe said the complaints reflected the unwillingness of some new residents to adapt to life in the bush. \n\"The long-termers in town think it's ridiculous, but the newbies seem to want them eradicated,\" Ms Milbourne said. \n\"Since city people have been coming out in droves, they're the only ones who are whingeing.\" \nFellow resident Tina Taylor agreed. \n\"If it was something serious and not just their gardens being munched on, they might have a better leg to stand on,\" Ms Taylor said. \n\"When you're choosing a garden over an animal's life that's here and part of the community, it's just ridiculous.\" Photo: Mr Hansen managed to round up around 170 goats during his time in Kambalda. (ABC Goldfields-Esperance: Sam Tomlin) Goats now destined for meatworks \nWhile unable to tell if he wrangled the entire Kambalda herd, Mr Hansen said he believed he had accounted for a large majority. \nWith the venture west being less profitable and more frustrating than he initially anticipated, he said the trip had been a learning experience. \n\"As I said, it's been a busman's holiday and I've learned a lot,\" Mr Hansen said. \n\"I've driven the Nullarbor, which I'd never done, so it's a 'bucket list' thing.\" \nThe goats, now safely penned at a nearby station, will be shipped to meatworks in WA's Great Southern. \n\"They'll be sent down south towards Katanning and I'll be heading back east,\" Mr Hansen said. \n\"I've had my moments of drama ... there's never a dull moment.\"",

By comparison, Topaz Farm, which can generate up to 550 megawatts of power, took almost two years and over 2.5 billion in funds to build. \nAdani Group sponsored and oversaw the project. “Before us, the largest solar power plant at a single location was in California in the U.S. That was 550 MW and was completed in around three years. We wanted to set up a solar plant of 648 MW in a single location in less than a year,” said Adani CEO Vneet Jaain. \nWith the introduction of this solar farm, India is expected to become the world’s third-biggest solar market from next year, trailing behind only China and the US. \nStill, the country has a long way to go before reaching its goals to generate solar energy for 60 million homes by 2022, with plans to produce 40 percent of its power needs from non-fossil fuels by 2030. \nIn case you want to catch a glimpse of the colossal plant, National Geographic has previously made a documentary about Adani’s ambitious undertaking.",

    "text": "Sections News Peter Dutton reveals the US has a limit to the number of refugees it will take Michael Koziol, Political reporter Aa Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has acknowledged there is a limit to the number of refugees who will go to the US as part of a resettlement deal with Australia, but said it is \"not in our best interests\" to reveal the figure. He emphatically denied a Sky News report that claimed Washington may take just 300 or 400 of the 1600 refugees eligible to apply for resettlement in the US. \"That is completely false,\" Mr Dutton said. The Turnbull government has repeatedly refused to reveal how many refugees from Manus Island and Nauru the Obama Administration has agreed to take, or whether there is a cap. But Mr Dutton on Tuesday admitted there was such a limit, when asked directly if he had discussed it with the US. \"Yes and I'm not going to detail that, and there are very good reasons for that,\" he told Sky News. \"It's not in our best interests to have that number out there. [But] the reports about the 300 number are completely false. I don't want people to conjure up in their mind that this is limited by that number - it's not.\" Department of Immigration statistics show there were 872 men on Manus Island and 390 people on Nauru at the end of October. A further 750 people live outside the regional processing centre in the Nauruan community. There were also 377 people, including about 90 families, on the Australian mainland who were brought here for medical treatment. They are eligible to apply for the US offer but may have to return to Nauru or Manus first. A spokeswoman for the minister confirmed that of those 2400 people, about 1600 have been found to be refugees, with the others either found not be owed protection or still being processed. Sky News reported that 16 officers from the US Department of Homeland Security will arrive in Nauru on Sunday to commence work on the arrangement but it will not be finalised before Donald Trump is inaugurated on January 20. The pay-TV network, which was given rare access to Nauru, asylum seekers and officials, interviewed many refugees and found most were keen to settle in the US but were sceptical about it happening. Some were hostile to the idea. Aziz Khan, a Rohinga Muslim from Myanmar who has been on Nauru for two years, said he did not want to go to the US under Mr Trump. \"No, I don't prefer. Because I am a Muslim. The President-elect Donald Trump doesn't like Muslims in his country as a migrant,\" he said. Nauruan deputy police commissioner Kalinda Blake said police were concerned about the fate of those who are inevitably left behind, including the possibility they would commit acts of violence or self-harm. \"The Nauru Police force is actually putting plans in place just to cater for should that happen,\" she said on Sky News. \"I would not wish there would be any [cases of self-harm] but will be ready for it if there should be.\" In another of the Sky News program's revelations, acting Nauruan president David Adyang admitted the country had banned Australian media outlets from visiting the island, but waived it in certain circumstances. \"Selectively we bring in Australian media to try and provide balanced reporting on what we are doing,\" he said.

    "text": "Wednesday, Nov 23, 2016 11:00 PM UTC Thanksgiving, a day of mourning for Native Americans Native Americans are still here — and Thanksgiving is a day of remembrance and activism for us 0 All Share Services Topics: Dakota Access Pipeline , Native American , Native American Cultures , Native American representation , Thanksgiving , Thanksgiving: A Day of Mourning for Native Americans Looking Forwar , Life News A photo of the author during the annual Shinnecock Indian Powwow. \nPlagues, fires, taking from giving — these are the associations many of my relatives have with traditional American Thanksgiving, all the way back to our ancestors. This history of generosity and hospitality by the original people of these lands that were taken away and who were destroyed by illness is well articulated in Native American poet Allison Adelle Hedge Coke’s poem “ America, I Sing Back .” \nOh, before America began to sing, I sung her to sleep, held her cradleboard, wept her into day. My song gave her creation, prepared her delivery, held her severed cord beautifully beaded. \nMy song helped her stand, held her hand for first steps, nourished her very being, fed her, placed her three sisters strong. \nCoke illustrated the tenuous grasp the arriving settlers had on life and how the inhabitants of the “Americas” helped them to survive by guiding them and showing them the agricultural “three sisters” method of growing corn, beans and squash (still referred to in the “Farmer’s Almanac” today). For the subsequent hundreds of years, Indian people, and the wrongs done to our contributions and us, have been forsaken. \nOn Thanksgiving Day at noon, as they have for the past 46 years, Native Americans whose heritage lies in the band of Indians called Wampanoag will gather on Cole’s Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to commemorate a National Day of Mourning. The United American Indians of New England’s website, which requested organizing and food-serving volunteers for this year’s gathering, declares “We Are Not Vanishing. We Are Not Conquered. We Are As Strong As Ever.” It is a message that lives in the hearts and minds of indigenous people the world around: We are still here. \nAnd while many of us are modernized and fully functioning people with a toe in two proverbial worlds — the Western one and the sovereign, Native one — there are many Native Americans who do not celebrate the Pilgrims’ arrival with a feast. Nor do they herald the transgressions against humanity done them by other European settlers. \nIn 1637 Massachusetts Gov. John Winthrop celebrated the first official “Day of Thanksgiving” to mark the homecoming of men from the English colony. Part of this grateful day that was left out of common knowledge? Six hundred Pequots were destroyed after laying down their weapons and accepting Christianity. This was nothing to be thankful for. \nWell before that, the original Wampanoag feast was called Nikkomosachmiawene (or “Grand Sachem’s Council Feast”). In 1621, the Wampanoag amassed the food to help the Pilgrims. This is what European settlers came to know as “Thanksgiving Day.” \nIf you grew up learning in school about the Pilgrims and the Indians being good, happy friends and have not yet read a retelling like Howard Zinn’s “A People’s History of the United States,” you might not realize that for American Indians, Thanksgiving is a reminder of the genocide of millions of our people, the quashing of our culture and traditions and the stealing of our virgin lands. \nMost Americans know something of the true history by now and perhaps not everyone cares. After all, there is a virtue in gathering with family and friends one day a year to eat a lot and share company, if you remove the historic significance. \nThose who do care have been vocal about supporting the fight for clean water preservation at Standing Rock, North Dakota, an opposition by water protectors, Native Americas and non-Native people, that has waged on for seven months. Last Sunday night it grew still worse when 400 people were teargassed and sprayed with freezing water from powerful hoses. \nAnd so descendants of the people of the Eastern shores will show up at Cole’s Hill on Thursday to honor their ancestors and in particular to acknowledge the current challenges Native people continue to face in this country. Poverty, alcoholism, drugs and the decimation of natural resources (which, as I’ve said in recent Salon interviews about the Dakota Access Pipeline, are a human problem, not an Indian issue alone) are paramount, and unyielding. \nSaid United American Indians of New England in a statement: “It is a day of remembrance and spiritual connection, as well as a protest of the racism and oppression which Native Americans continue to experience.” \nWhile most school children are still taught that Native Americans helped the Pilgrims and were invited to the first Thanksgiving feast, we can work to help them understand in an age-appropriate way that it wasn’t all roses. When your children put on an Indian or Pilgrim costume for their first Thanksgiving play, they often learn an incomplete, incorrect history. \nStill, it can be damaging to share the realities of a genocidal story with young children. Instead, for each of the past two years, in coincidence with these school lessons and plays, I have donned my tribal regalia, as have my school-age children. I visit their classrooms and share elements of Native American culture, food and agriculture with curious minds, as my mother and elder relatives did for my elementary classes. \nI answer questions about how Indians really lived, and in a careful way, explain that without the Indians, no arriving settlers — essentially city slickers— would have survived. In this way, I enforce a presence of gratitude, something all children can understand and benefit positively from. \nIn Native American Heritage Month, it seems a good time to recognize not only the legacy of Native people and how we continue to survive but also how our approach to treating our Earth is the only way civilization as a whole will remain. Looking down the snare of the “black snake,” as Native people refer to oil transfer pipelines, there are lessons for everyone. As the stewards of the land, the water and the sky, Native Americans have great historical lessons to teach of kindness, of respect, of temperance. I would argue that these are lessons for all people on Thanksgiving Day. \n“Oh, but here I am, here I am, here, I remain high on each and every peak, carefully rumbling her great underbelly, prepared to pour forth singing — and sing again I will, as I have always done,” Coke’s poem concludes. America “will make herself over. My song will make it so. . . . When she grows far past her self-considered purpose, I will sing her back, sing her back. I will sing. Oh, I will — I do. America, I sing back. Sing back what sung you in.” \nAnd so it will be again, as it was.

Golian didn’t want to give her name, explaining she feared for her safety. \nThe operator said she had to leave her name but that it wouldn’t be revealed. \nAn Administration for Children's Services lawyer wound up subpoenaing Golian in March 2016, however. Somehow, the mom learned Golian made a report. \nAbout a month later, when Golian was leaving school, the mom was waiting outside. \nThe mom started hurling insults at Golian. And when Golian tried calling the cops, the mom swiped her phone — and slammed the teacher to the ground, punching and kicking her until a Good Samaritan intervened. \nDuring the beatdown, the mom said, “I know what you did. I know you called ACS on me,” the lawsuit claims. \n“I just feel like by doing my job I’m protecting them, but there’s literally nobody protecting me,” said Golian. \nGolian's lawyer, Gerald Cohen, said, “We believe this is not an isolated incident.” \nCops arrested the mom in relation to the beating. She pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and got three years of probation, say court papers that identify her as Jennifer DeJesus. \nA city Law Department spokesman said the city will review the suit.

A video posted to Facebook shows a man ranting while onboard a Delta Air Lines flight about President-elect Donald Trump, calling others 'Hillary b----s\" Tuesday November 22, 2016. (Facebook) \nA Facebook video circulating on social media showed the man – whose name was not released – calling passengers “Hillary b----es” after he asked how many people voted for President-elect Donald Trump on board Flight 248 bound for Allentown, Pa., on Nov. 22. \nTrump supporter fired from bank job for racist Obama comments \n\"Donald Trump, baby!\" the man shouted in the 45-second video . \"That's right. This man knows what's up. We got some Hillary b----es on here. C'mon baby, Trump!\" \nIf Delta employees had known about the video before take-off, “there is no question they would have removed him from the aircraft,” Bastin noted. \nAt the time, flight attendants had escorted the man off the plane, but he boarded again minutes later and went to his seat where he had no further meltdowns, according to a 21-year-old Belize resident who recorded the unruly scene. Delta Air Lines said the man has been banned from flying the airline. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg) \nDelta acknowledged in a previous statement that the man should have been removed from the flight. \n“I also want to make sure all of you know we have your backs,” Bastin added in the note. “The heightened tension in our society means that now more than ever we must require civility on our planes and in our facilities.” \n“We will not tolerate anything less,” he said.

    "text": "Story highlights 2M TV runs item to mark International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women It prompts a furious response from activists, who said it normalizes violence (CNN) To help women battling domestic violence, a Moroccan TV channel offered some advice: Cover your bruises with makeup.\nThe state-owned 2M TV caused controversy with its segment on Wednesday showing a makeup artist covering blue \"bruises\" on the eyes and cheeks of a model. \"It's a painful and sorrowful topic, but on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, we will show you the makeup [to cover the signs] of beatings,\" said the smiling artist. \"It is a topic we lack the courage to discuss.\" The makeup artist showed how to cover facial bruising with concealer. The segment, which apparently also used makeup to create the \"bruise,\" angered activists, who said it normalized domestic violence. Activists also created a petition on the change.org website calling for punitive measures against the morning show. Read More \"Do not cover domestic violence with makeup, condemn the aggressor,\" said the petition , posted by a group calling themselves Concerned Moroccan Citizens. \"As Moroccan women and as feminist activists in Morocco, and in the name of all Moroccan people, we denounce the message of normalization with violence against women. We demand severe sanctions against this show, 'Sabahiyat,' and the channel 2M,\" they added.\nThey encouraged signatories to contact the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication, demanding it take action against 2M and \"Sabahiyat.\" The TV segment prompted campaigners to say, \"Do not cover domestic violence with makeup, condemn the aggressor.\" The channel apologized two days later, saying the segment was inappropriate, an editorial error of judgment and in violation of its policy of 27 years that advocated for women's rights. It also removed the video clip from its website. The apology did little to placate the outrage. Social media users continue to condemn the channel and the petition had attracted more than 2,000 signatures by Monday. \"The media attacks the core of all plans to combat violence against women,\" Moroccan politician Saadiya Elbahi wrote on Facebook. \"It normalizes violence against women, legitimizes it and covers it with makeup.\" Domestic violence is not a crime in Morocco and, according to a government survey conducted in 2009/10 by Human Rights Watch, two thirds of women had experienced physical, psychological, sexual or economic violence. A draft bill criminalizing domestic violence was passed by the first chamber of parliament, the House of Representatives, in Morocco in July. However, due to a general election last month, it has yet to be reviewed by the second chamber, the House of Councillors. According to Rothna Begum, Middle East and North Africa women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, the draft bill does not do enough to ensure victims will get the help they need from authorities. \"It is a step forward. It does provide for some protective measures but only where a victim has started a prosecution, and women often tend to drop prosecutions because of pressure from their families,\" she said. CNN contacted 2M TV and the High Authority of Audiovisual Communication. They did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "text": "Office of the Press Secretary For Immediate Release Press Conference by President Obama in Lima, Peru Lima Convention Centre Lima, Peru \n5:52 P.M. PET \nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Good evening, everybody. Let me begin by thanking President Kuczynski and the wonderful people of Peru for hosting us and for their outstanding hospitality. Peru is one of the United States’ strongest partners in the Americas -- from standing up for democracy, to promoting jobs and growth, to fighting climate change. And this summit has been a success thanks to the great work of our Peruvian friends. So on behalf of us all, muchas gracias. \nThis summit, and my trip over the past week, has obviously occurred against a backdrop of the broader debate over globalization and trade. As I’ve said, over the decades, our global, integrated economy has helped to improve the lives of billions of people around the world with historic gains in prosperity, education, and health. At the same time, when jobs and capital can move across borders, when workers have less leverage, when wealthy corporations and global elites too often seem to be playing by a different set of rules, then workers and communities can be hit especially hard; the gaps between the rich and everyone else grow wider. And that can reverberate through our politics. \nThat’s why I firmly believe that one of our greatest challenges in the years ahead -- across our nations and within them -- will be to make sure that the benefits of the global economy are shared by more people and that the negative impacts, such as economic inequalities, are addressed by all nations. When it comes to trade, I believe that the answer is not to pull back or try to erect barriers to trade. Given our integrated economies and global supply chains, that would hurt us all. But rather the answer is to do trade right, making sure that it has strong labor standards, strong environmental standards, that it addresses ways in which workers and ordinary people can benefit rather than be harmed by global trade. All of this is the central work of APEC. \nAs this debate moves forward in the United States, it’s important to remember how vital the Asia Pacific is to America’s prosperity. The 21 Asia Pacific economies here represent nearly three billion people, a majority of the global middle class, six of America’s top 10 trading partners, more than half of the global economy, and the world’s fastest-growing region. In other words, these 21 countries represent tremendous opportunity for the United States to sell our goods and support U.S. jobs. And that’s why, as part of the rebalance of our foreign policy to the Asia Pacific, we’ve boosted U.S. exports to the region by some 50 percent. Nearly 60 percent of our exports go to the region. \nAnd this is part of broader progress. With 95 percent of the world’s customers beyond America’s borders, I’ve made it a priority to open up new markets overseas. And during my administration, we’ve increased U.S. exports to the world by more than 40 percent -- to record levels -- and these exports support more than 11 million American jobs. Moreover, we know that companies that export tend to grow faster and hire more employees and pay their workers more than companies that do not export. All of which is why exports have helped to drive our economic recovery. It's one of the reasons that U.S. businesses have created more than 15 million new jobs. \nSo that’s the kind of progress that trade -- when done right -- can deliver. And that’s the kind of work that we’ve tried to do here at this summit. We’re continuing our work to make it easier to do business between our countries so we’re creating even more jobs. In the United States, we’re simplifying the process of starting a new business, increasing access to credit, all of which will help more ventures -- especially small businesses -- get up and running, and helping them to be able to export as well, so that they can access a global market even if they can't afford fancy lawyers and accountants and foreign offices. \nWe agreed to increase our collective effort against corruption by targeting the bribery that enriches elites at the expense of people. And we committed to making it easier to trade in services as well as goods. \nWe also discussed the excess capacity that exists in certain sectors, like steel and aluminum that distorts markets and hurts business and workers, including American workers. And even as I've argued that we cannot engage in protectionist measures, my administration has been at the forefront of really cracking down hard on unfair trade practices and brought, consistently, cases against the -- cases under the WTO against those who are engaging in unfair trading practices, and we've had a great track record of trade enforcement that has to be a part of this process. \nI’ve been very clear that excess capacity is not the result of market forces; it’s the result of specific government policies, and it needs to be fixed. And here at APEC, we've been taking steps, as we were at the G20 in Hangzhou, to start addressing these issues in a systematic way. \nWith regard to the digital economy, we endorsed rules to protect the privacy of personal information as it crosses borders. We discussed the importance of maintaining the current moratorium on customs duties for digital goods and innovation. And given growing cyber threats, our 21 APEC economies affirmed that no one should conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, with the intent to providing a competitive advantage to companies or commercial sectors. \nWe’re also moving ahead with making our economies more inclusive. And one particular area of focus is making sure that women have fair access to economic growth -- expanding education; expanding access to careers in science, technology, engineering and math; helping more women entrepreneurs to access finance and integrate their businesses into the global supply chain. According to one study, if women around the world participated in the labor force, it could add up to $28 trillion of additional output for the global economy -- $28 trillion. When women are more prosperous, then families, communities and countries are all more prosperous as well. \nMy meeting yesterday with my fellow leaders of the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a chance to reaffirm our commitment to the TPP, with its high standards, strong protections for workers, the environment, intellectual property and human rights. Our partners made very clear during the meeting that they want to move forward with TPP; preferably, they’d like to move forward with the United States. A number of countries already are starting to ratify TPP. \nAt the same time, we’re already hearing calls for a less ambitious trade agreement in the region with lower standards, lower protections for workers, lower protections for the environment. That kind of agreement would obviously exclude U.S. workers and businesses and access to those markets. So for all those reasons, I believe that TPP is a plus for America’s economy, America’s workers, American jobs. I think not moving forward would undermine our position across the region and our ability to shape the rules of global trade in a way that reflects our interests and our values. \nFinally, our cooperation with APEC has been critical to our historic progress in fighting climate change -- bringing the Paris agreement into force, agreeing to limit aviation emissions, phrasing out dangerous HFCs. Here in Lima, we continue our work to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and countries made new commitments toward our goal of doubling our renewable energy over the next two decades. \nSo, as I wrap up my last summit and likely my last foreign trip as President, I could not be more proud of the progress that we’ve made together. Obviously, the work is never done. And given the prosperity and security we seek for not only the United States but our allies and our partners, I continue to believe that America will have a vital role to play in creating and sustaining a strong, enduring leadership role in the Asia Pacific. \nSo, with that, let me take some questions. And I'll start with Darlene Superville of AP. \nQ Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve been telling world leaders this week that President-elect Trump is unlikely to govern in the divisive way that he campaigned. But I'm wondering, how can you be so certain of that given that the first group of people he’s chosen for top national security and law enforcement positions hold the same views that he espoused as a candidate? And second, to follow up on your meeting earlier today with President Putin, did you discuss with him Russia’s alleged meddling in the U.S. election? And are you concerned that the kind of involvement that we saw in this year’s campaign will be the new normal going forward in future U.S. elections? \nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, what I have said to world leaders is the same thing that I've said in a number of press conferences, which is the President-elect now has to put together a team and put forward specifics about how he intends to govern. And he hasn't had a full opportunity to do that yet. And so people should take a wait-and-see approach in how much his policy proposals once in the White House, once he is sworn in, matches up with some of the rhetoric of his campaign. \nMy simple point is, is that you can't assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy. \nI can't be sure of anything. I think, like everyone else, we'll have to wait and see. But as I've said before, once you're in the Oval Office, once you begin interacting with world leaders, once you see the complexities of the issues, that has a way of shaping your thinking and, in some cases, modifying your thinking, because you recognize this solemn responsibility not only to the American people but the solemn responsibility that America has as the largest, most powerful country in the world. \nAnd I can't guarantee that the President-elect won't pursue some of the positions that he's taken. But what I can guarantee is, is that reality will force him to adjust how he approaches many of these issues. That's just the way this office works. \nAnd I've said before, if these issues were easy -- if ensuring prosperity, jobs, security, good foreign relations with other countries -- if all that was simple, then it would have been done by every previous President. And I'm a pretty good presidential historian; I've looked at my 43 predecessors, and it seems like for all of them -- even the best ones -- that you end up confronting realities that you didn't anticipate. I think the same will happen here. And that's a good thing. That's an important thing. \nWith respect to President Putin, I didn't have a meeting. We talked briefly while we were in between sessions. And the conversation that I had with him was consistent with the conversations I've had with him over the previous several months, indicating to him that we are still deeply concerned about the bloodshed and chaos that's being sown by constant bombing attacks by Assad and the Russian military against populations in Aleppo, and the need for us to arrive first at some sort of humanitarian ceasefire and begin moving towards a political transition of some sort. \nAnd I talked to him about Ukraine and the need for us to get Minsk done. I urged him to instruct his negotiators to work with ourselves, with Frances, with Germany, with Ukraine to see if we can get that done before my term is up. As usual, it was a candid and courteous meeting, but very clear about the strong differences that we have on policy. \nThe issue of the elections did not come up because that's behind us and I was focused in this brief discussion on moving forward. I had already made very clear to him our concerns around cyberattacks, generally, as well as specific concerns we had surrounding the DNC hack. \nI don't think this will be the norm, but as I've said before, the concern I have has less to do with any particular misinformation or propaganda that's being put out by any particular party, and a greater concern about the general misinformation from all kinds of sources -- domestic, foreign, on social media -- that make it very difficult for voters to figure out what's true and what's not. And let me put it this way. I think if we have a strong, accurate and responsible press, and we have a strong, civic culture and an engaged citizenry, then various attempts to meddle in our elections won't mean much. \nIf, generally, we've got elections that aren't focused on issues and are full of fake news and false information and distractions, then the issue is not going to be what's happening from the outside; the issue is going to be what are we doing for ourselves from the inside. The good news is that's something that we have control over. \nGardiner Harris. \nQ Mr. President, thanks so much for holding this press conference. If you had had hotels, real estate, and other businesses distributed around the world prior to becoming President, would you have thought it appropriate to sell them off and put the cash proceeds in a blind trust? Or is it okay for the President of the United States to be personally vulnerable to the policy decisions of the foreign leaders he meets and in the foreign policy decisions he makes as President? And also, just briefly, what's your complaint about how the NSA and Cyber Command have done their job? And are you considering firing Admiral Mike Rogers? \nPRESIDENT OBAMA: That was a rhetorical question, that first one. (Laughter.) Rather than comment on hypotheticals, let me say specifically what I did. Obviously, my assets were significantly smaller than some other Presidents or President-elects. But we made a decision to liquidate assets that might raise questions about how it would influence policy. \nI basically had our accountant put all our money in Treasury bills -- the yields, by the way, have not been massive over the course of the last eight years -- (laughter) -- just because it simplified my life. I did not have to worry about the complexities of whether a decision that I made might even inadvertently benefit me. \nAnd that's consistent with the broader approach that we've taken throughout my administration, which is to not just meet the letter of the law, but to go well beyond the letter to the spirit of the law -- not just for me, but for the people in the White House and in our leadership positions. \nWe have established a whole set of rules, norms, playbooks that just keep us far away from the line. Early on in the administration, there would be questions about could a staff person go to this conference, or what should they do about this gift that was provided. And I think it was maybe our first general counsel who was responsible for setting up our guidelines and rules inside the White House that said, if it sounds like it would be fun, then you can't do it. (Laughter.) That's a general test. If it sounds like something you would enjoy or appreciate -- no go. \nAnd as a consequence -- and I'll knock on some wood here, because we got two months left -- I am extremely proud of the fact that over eight years we have not had the kinds of scandals that have plagued other administrations. And when I met with the President-elect, I suggested to him that having a strong White House Counsel that could provide clear guideposts and rules would benefit him and benefit his team because it would eliminate a lot of ambiguity. And I think it will be up to him to make determinations about how he wants to approach it. \nI know what worked for us, and I think it served the American people well. And because I had made a promise to the American people that I would not fall into some of the familiar habits of Washington, that I wanted a new kind of politics, this was one indicator. And at the end of eight years, I think I can say to the American people I delivered on that commitment. \nWith respect to cyber, the NSA, Admiral Rogers is a terrific patriot and has served this country well in a number of positions. I generally don't comment on personnel matters here. I can say generally that we've spent a lot of time over the last several years looking at how we can organize our cyber efforts to keep pace with how rapidly the environment is changing. \nIncreasingly, our critical infrastructure, government data, financial systems are vulnerable to attack. And both state and non-state actors are getting better and better at it, and it is becoming more and more rapid. And it is inevitable that we're doing to have to modernize and update not just the tools we use to defend those assets and the American people, but also how we organize it. And it is true that we are exploring a range of options in terms of how we organize the mission that currently exists. \nRich Edson. \nQ Good evening, and thank you, Mr. President. Earlier this year, former President George W. Bush reportedly said that he worried he would be the last Republican President. Now Republicans have won the White House, control the House and Senate, two-thirds of state legislatures, 34 governorships, and there are charges of a shallow Democratic bench behind you. Are you worried you could be the last Democratic President for a while? And secondly, sir, speaking of your predecessor, he made sure to offer essentially no public criticism of you during your time in office. Will you equally withhold public criticism for President Trump, even if he attempts to dismantle much of what you’ve accomplished? Thank you. \nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, no, I'm not worried about being the last Democratic President. I think -- not even for a while. And I say that, not being cute. The Democratic nominee won the popular vote, and obviously this was an extremely competitive race and I would expect that future races will be competitive as well. I certainly think it's true that politics in America right now are a little up for grabs, that some of the old alignments within both parties -- Democrat and Republican -- are being reshaped. And although the results of this election involved some of the specifics of the candidates and aren't going to be duplicated in every subsequent election, Democrats do have to do some thinking about how do we make sure that the message we have is received effectively and results in winning elections. \nThis is something that I've been wrestling with throughout my presidency. When you look at the proposals I put forward, they garner majority support. The majority believes in raising the minimum wage. The majority believes in common-sense gun safety rules. The majority believes in investing to rebuild our infrastructure and create jobs. The majority believes in making sure that people aren't going bankrupt when they get sick. The majority agrees with all the individual components of Obamacare. \nI think there was a Gallup Poll this week, subsequent to the election, that showed that the general public has a more favorable view of Democrats than Republicans. And as I noted, my approval ratings are quite high. And yet what’s been true during the course of my eight years is that does not always translate; in fact, too often it hasn't translated into working majorities either at the state level or at the federal level. \nNow, some of that is just the nature of our system, and geography. As long as Wyoming gets the same number of senators as California, there’s going to be some tilt towards Republicans when it comes to congressional races. The fact that a lot of Democratic voters are bunched up in big cities, and a lot of Republican voters are spread out across geography gives them an advantage when it comes to congressional races. \nSome of it is just political bad luck. For example, I came in as an economy was in free fall, and although we took the right steps to save the economy, in my midterm election in 2010, people couldn't yet see the recovery and, not surprisingly, the President’s party got punished. We lost control of a lot of not just congressional seats but also gubernatorial seats and state legislative seats. And that happened to be the year that the Census is done and you start doing redistricting, and those Republicans took advantage of political gerrymandering to lock in majorities, even though in numerous subsequent elections, Democrats have actually cast more votes -- or more votes have been cast for Democratic congressional candidates than Republican. And yet you end up having large Republican majorities. \nSo there are just some structural problems that we have to deal with. But, look, you can't make excuses about the rules. That's the deal, and we got to do better. And I think doing better, as I said, involves us working at the grassroots; not ceding territory; going out into areas where right now we may not stand a chance of actually winning but we're building up a cadre of young talent; we're making arguments; we're persuading; we're talking about the things that matter to ordinary people, day to day, and trying to avoid some of the constant distractions that fill up people’s Twitter accounts. \nAnd if we do that, then I'm confident that we'll be back on track. I don't think that there has to be a complete overhaul here. I think that there does have to be better organization, a smarter message. And one message I do have for Democrats is that a strategy that's just micro-targeting particular, discrete groups in a Democratic coalition sometimes will win you elections, but it's not going to win you the broad mandate that you need. And ultimately, the more we can talk about what we have in common as a nation, and speak to a broad set of values, a vision that speaks to everybody and not just one group at a time, the better off we're going to be. \nI think that's part of the reason why I was able to get elected twice, is that I always tried to make sure that, not only in proposals but also in message, that I was speaking to everybody. \nYou had a second part to your question? \nQ (Inaudible.) \nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Ah. Look, I've said before, President Bush could not have been more gracious to me when I came in. And my intention is to, certainly for the next two months, is finish my job. And then, after that, to take Michelle on vacation, get some rest, spend time with my girls, and do some writing, do some thinking. So I want to be respectful of the office and give the President-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every instance. \nAs an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I'll examine it when it comes. But what I do know is, is that I have to take Michelle on vacation. (Laughter.) \nJuliet Eilperin. \nQ Thanks, Mr. President. Given what you just said about the strong differences that you and President Putin have on the future of Syria and the conflict there, can you talk a little about how you see that unfolding, both at the end of your tenure, at the beginning of Donald Trump’s, and whether you have concerns that even if we eliminate the Islamic state in eastern Syria and western Iraq, you may be allowing a permanent al Qaeda safe haven around Aleppo and (inaudible.) And on Aleppo, can you say to what extent you think the United States has fulfilled its responsibility to protect in that instance? \nAnd then, in terms of finishing your job, which you just mentioned, last week you exercised your executive authority on multiple fronts -- finalizing oil and gas leasing rules on public lands, as well as issuing a five-year leasing plan, banning drilling in the Arctic and the Atlantic. Many Republicans say that you should hold off finalizing anymore rules as you're headed out the door because they oppose many of them -- when they control both the executive and legislative branch next year. What do you say to that suggestion? \nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, on the second question, these are the same Republicans who suggested that they didn’t need to confirm a Supreme Court justice when I was nine months out until the next election. I think their general approach seems to be that probably two days after my reelection, I should stop until the next election. I don't think that that's what the Constitution calls for. \nThe regulations that we have issued are ones that we've been working on for a very long time. They’ve been subject to extensive public notice and comment, and everybody has known they’ve been out there. These aren't things that we've been surprising people with. They’re well-considered, they’re the right thing to do. They’re part of my task of finishing my work. \nAnd I recognize that when the new administration comes in, and a new Congress comes in, that they will have the option of trying to undo some of those rules and regulations that we've put in place. And that's their prerogative. That's part of how democracy works. But I feel very strongly these are the right things to do, and I'm going to make sure I do them. \nWith respect to Syria, as I said I think even on this trip in a previous press conference, I am not optimistic about the short-term prospects in Syria. Once Russia and Iran made a decision to back Assad in a brutal air campaign and essentially a pacification of Aleppo, regardless of the potential for civilian casualties, children being killed or wounded, schools or hospitals being destroyed, then it was very hard to see a way in which even a trained and committed moderate opposition could hold its ground for long periods of time. \nAnd the issue that obviously I've wrestled with for the last five years -- how involved should the United States be? What are our legal constraints in such involvement? What are our moral obligations? What are our strategic interests? Those haven't changed. I continue to believe that we did not have a legal basis for military intervention there; that it would have been a strategic mistake given the work we still had to do in Iraq, the counter-ISIL campaign, ongoing operations in Afghanistan; that we had worked tirelessly to arrive at a political transition of some sort that could alleviate the suffering and provide humanitarian access. And we will continue to do that work all the way until the last day that me and John Kerry and others have the authority to speak for the United States government. \nBut ultimately, it takes two -- or in this case, four, or six, or eight -- to tango. And we're just not getting help or interest from those parties that are supporting Assad, and Assad, as a consequence, has been emboldened. Look, this is a man who has decided that destroying his country, turning it to rubble, and seeing its population scattered or killed was worth it for him to cling to power, when he had the option to peacefully engage in a transition that could have kept the country intact. That's his mentality. That's not a mentality we support. That's a mentality that the Russians and the Iranians have been willing to support. But at this stage, we're going to need to have a change in how all parties think about this in order for us to end the situation there. \nNow, our ability to go after ISIL I think can be sustained. There’s no doubt that there will continue to be extremist forces in and around Syria because it's still going to be in chaos for quite some time. There will be elements in Iraq, just as there have been elements in Afghanistan even after the Taliban we're swept out, even after we killed bin Laden. But I think we can effectively reduce the risk and take their key external operators off the field. \nThe thing I'm probably most concerned about is making sure that even as we do that, U.S. policy, U.S. statements, U.S. positions don't further radicalize Muslims around the world, or alienate and potentially law-abiding Muslims who are living in Europe or the United States. And that's why I think it's important for us to understand those are our key allies in this fight, not enemies. \nMike Memoli. \nQ Thank you, Mr. President. This final foreign trip of your presidency is obviously playing out in very different circumstances than you might have expected. A very different transition is underway than the one you might have envisioned. Given that, though, I wonder if you intentionally sought to approach this trip reflecting more on the powers of and influence of the presidency on the world stage so that you might be able to offer the kind of counsel to your successor that he has said he hopes to draw upon. \nAnd also, on a political note, you talked often during your reelection campaign about this fever that had consumed the Republican Party, an effective political strategy that they employed to block you even on issues where there might have been some common ground. What would be your advice to Democrats who might see that kind of strategy as the same kind of path to taking back power that the Republicans employed? And related to that, what would your advice be to House Democrats about whether or not to reelect Nancy Pelosi as the party leader in the House? \nPRESIDENT OBAMA: I'll work in reverse. I think Nancy Pelosi is an outstanding and historic political leader. So much of what we accomplished was accomplished because of her smarts, her tenacity, her legislative skill. And I don't normally meddle with party votes, and certainly on my way out the door, probably I shouldn’t meddle here. But I cannot speak highly enough of Nancy Pelosi. She combines strong, progressive values with just extraordinary political skill. And she does stuff that's tough, not just stuff that's easy. She’s done stuff that's unpopular in her own base because it's the right thing to do for the American people. I think she’s a remarkable leader. \nWith respect to Democrats and Republicans and how Democrats should deal with a new administration, I think you give them a hearing. I certainly don't want them to do what Mitch McConnell did when I was elected -- meet the day of and say our sole objective is to not cooperate with him on anything even if the country is about to go into a depression, so that we can gain seats in the midterms and ultimately defeat him. \nThat's not why the American people send us to Washington, to play those games. So that's not my advice to Democrats. My advice to Democrats is know what you care about and what you stand for, and fight for your principles even if it's a hard fight. If there are areas where the new administration is doing something that's going to be good for the American people, find a way to work with him. If you think it's going to be a problem, then say so, and make the argument. \nThe touchstone is, what’s good for the American people. And that's worked for me. That means that at the end of the day -- and at the end of eight years -- I can look back and I can say that I consistently did what I thought was best. It doesn’t mean you don't make mistakes, but it means that you're being true to your oath and the commitments you made to the people who elected you. \nAnd in terms of reflecting on the U.S. presidency as I've been traveling, I think the main reflection I have and the main advice that I give to the incoming President is the United States really is an indispensable nation in our world order. And I say that as somebody who has gone out of his way to express respect for every country and its people, and to consistently acknowledge that many of the challenges that we face are not challenges that America can solve on its own. But what I also know is that the basic framework of the world order coming out of World War II and then on through the end of the Cold War was shaped by a set of ideals and principles that have worked for the vast majority of people -- not just America, but around the world. The notion of democracy and rule of law, and a free press and independent judiciary, and open markets, and a social welfare state to moderate some off the sharp edges of capitalism, and lifting up issues of human rights, and investing in public health and development not just within our own borders but elsewhere in the world. And working with multilateral institutions, like the United Nations; making sure that were upholding international norms and rules. \nThat's what’s made the modern world. And there have been times where we, ourselves, have not observed some of these norms as well as we should, and have been accused of hypocrisy. Here in Latin America, there have been times where countries felt disrespected and, on occasion, had cause for that. There are times where we haven't observed these values in our own country and have fallen short of our ideals. But that basic structure is the reason why the world is much wealthier, much more secure, and, yes, less violent, healthier, better educated, more tolerant than it was 50 years ago. \nAnd that requires constant work. It doesn’t just happen on its own. I've said this in Europe. I've said this in places where there’s this pushback against this modern order. But you take an example like Europe -- before that order was imposed, we had two world wars in the span of 30 years. In the second one, 60 million people were killed. Not half a million, not a million, but 60 million. Entire continents in rubble. \nIn places like the Asia Pacific, before that order existed, you routinely saw famines of millions of people -- not just concerns about low wages, but people dying because they didn’t have any food or drinking water, or died of cholera or simple diseases -- if somebody had some penicillin. \nAnd so what I would say would be that we all share responsibilities for improving that order and maintaining it, and making sure it's more inclusive, and delivers greater hope and prosperity for more corners of the world. We all have responsibilities -- every nation -- in respecting the dignity and worth of their citizens. And America can't do it all for everybody else. There are limits to our reach into other countries if they’re determined to oppress their people, or not provide girls education, or siphon off development funds into Swiss bank accounts because they’re corrupt. We're not going to be able to handle every problem. \nBut the American President and the United States of America -- if we're not on the side of what’s right, if we're not making the argument and fighting for it, even if sometimes we're not able to deliver at 100 percent everywhere -- then it collapses. And there’s nobody to fill the void. There really isn't. There are other very important countries -- like a China -- where if it weren't for China’s cooperation, we couldn't have gotten the Paris agreement done. But China is not the one who was going around organizing 200 nations to sign on to a Paris agreement, or putting together the paper and the policy outlines and the conceptual framework. \nRussia is a very significant military power, but they’re not worrying right now about how to rebuild after a hurricane in Haiti. We are. \nAnd I've said before, that's a burden that we should carry proudly. And I would hope that not just the 45th President of the United States, but every President of the United States understands that that's not only a burden, but it's also an extraordinary privilege. And if you have a chance to do that right, then you should seize it. \nAll right? Thank you, everybody. (Applause.) \nEND",

    "text": "Eat your damn pie this Thanksgiving It’s really not worth feeling guilty about a little over-indulgence during the holidays. Maren Caruso Like clockwork, the pre-Thanksgiving articles and TV segments on how to stick to a diet, how to avoid overeating , and how to “ detox ” after you’ve over-indulged have arrived. Tips include replacing potatoes with cauliflower, filling up on salad instead of stuffing, and doing everything you can to tune out the siren call of creamy pumpkin pie. I say: Ignore this miserable advice. Just eat your damn pie this Thanksgiving. Here’s what’s wrong with obsessing about a slice or two of pie this week: It’s a distraction from what really matters for health. Much more important in the long run is creating an environment and habits that foster healthy eating for the other 364 days. Now, there is some evidence that holidays can lead to modest amounts of weight gain. But a few rich meals this time of year aren’t going to relegate you to a life of ill health if you have a healthy diet most days. And the energy spent fighting temptation or scolding yourself will only make you feel bad. So what does healthy eating look like? It’s actually not that complicated. Check out this recent consensus statement from a very diverse group of nutrition researchers, who got together to discuss what they all agree on about nutrition and health: A healthy dietary pattern is higher in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, seafood, legumes, and nuts; moderate in alcohol (among adults); lower in red and processed meats; and low in sugar-sweetened foods and drinks and refined grains. Additional strong evidence shows that it is not necessary to eliminate food groups or conform to a single dietary pattern to achieve healthy dietary patterns. Rather, individuals can combine foods in a variety of flexible ways to achieve healthy dietary patterns, and these strategies should be tailored to meet the individual’s health needs, dietary preferences and cultural traditions. More fruits and vegetables. Less ultra-processed junk food. But there is no food bogeyman, not even pie. Anyone who tells you there’s one food to fear — one food that will make all the difference in your health — is probably trying to sell you something. “Thanksgiving is not the time to begin a diet, nor is it the right time to get serious about [dieting],” food policy and nutrition researcher Marion Nestle summed up. “The objective should be to relax and take pleasure in family, friends, and food.” Even more simply, obesity doctor Yoni Freedhoff says: “Just live the healthiest life you can enjoy.” Also remember: If the pie is already in front of you, your ability to resist it will be quite low, as Vox’s Brian Resnick has explained in his story on the myth of self-control . Research shows that “trying to teach people to resist temptation either only has short-term gains or can be an outright failure ,” he writes. In short, the pie has already won. Healthy eating is more about surrounding yourself with healthy options — not about how virtuous or strong a person you are. So, again, the focus should be on creating an environment that makes foods like fresh fruits and vegetables the default — at least most of the time. To be clear: That’s easier said than done for many people. We know that America’s food landscape is more obesity promoting than health promoting, and that fresh produce is more expensive than the salty, sugary, and fatty junk that is for sale everywhere. Right now, fewer than 3 percent of Americans manage to incorporate one or two of the very basics of a healthy lifestyle — more fruits and vegetables or going on walks — into their routines. These challenges abound all year round, not just during pie-rich holidays. “Thanksgiving is not the cause of overweight,” Nestle explained. “It’s the other 364 days of living in a relentless food marketing environment — food sold everywhere, 24/7, in huge portions — that makes weight control so difficult.” In that context, pie on Thanksgiving is the least of our worries.

    "text": "The Royal Cafe is staffed by refugees from the Red Cross camp in Oberhausen Hasan Al Babi, a Syrian refugee from Damascus, is steadily carving slices of chicken shawarma off a gas-heated rotisserie. It's lunchtime in Oberhausen and the German city's first Syrian restaurant is doing a brisk trade.\n\"It's not about the job as such,\" says Hassan.\n\"It's about the fact that I'm working and producing and not waiting for help at the job centre.\"\nIn the year since BBC News first visited Oberhausen , refugees have started to become part of the community.\nMore than 2,500 refugees, many fleeing conflict in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, are currently settled in the city.\nHassan Al Babi says working in the cafe is better than queuing in the job centre The Royal Cafe opened in August this year. The €30,000 (£25,000; $32,000) start-up cost was covered by German-Palestinian, Omallah ali Maher.\nThe café is managed by Mr Al Babi and another Syrian friend. It employs a further three Syrian refugees to serve its customers. Mr Ali Maher met them at the Red Cross camp in Oberhausen.\n\"They told me that they wanted to work for themselves. They don't want to be beggars,\" he said.\nHow a former migrant has helped finance a cafe providing work for five new Syrian refugees \"We don't have a written contract. I just looked in their eyes I see they are really honourable people.\"\nAll profits made by the business go towards paying the staff and paying back their debt.\nAccording to Mr Ali Maher, who helps the men by collecting supplies and doing their German paperwork, the café's model of using business to help refugees is the answer to Europe's migrant crisis.\n\"We can be successful by solving the refugee problem in Germany, when we get people to work,\" says Mr Omallah.\n\"I am 71 years old, I feel like 60 and I work from morning until the evening but I feel happy because I am doing a kind of nice work for those people and their families.\"\nCafé Royal's success is a positive reflection of how refugees are adapting to life in Oberhausen.\nThe city's new arrivals have now been moved from shared accommodation - blocks of flats used to house groups of migrants - and most are now in state-provided flats around the city.\n\"I think we are on top of the situation completely,\" says Joerg Fischer of the German Red Cross.\n\"Now a system is in place and is working well. Around 40 refugees arrive every week. This is nothing compared to last year when we had up to 300 a week. So we can manage this and the integration of those who've been here for longer.\"\nOberhausen lies in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which took in 172,511 asylum-seekers in the first 10 months of 2016.\nThat is almost 27% of the total number of people seeking asylum in Germany over that period, and more than double the number of the region with the next highest number of refugees, Baden Wuerttemberg.\nA BBC team first visited a year ago and returned last spring to speak to aid workers, residents and the asylum seekers themselves.\nHow one German city is coping with migrant crisis - BBC visits Oberhausen in November 2015\nChanging attitudes of a German city - BBC visits Oberhausen in April 2016\nSettling into school Svenja Beyer says it's easier to cope with just 12 pupils in her class In April this year Svenja Beyer's integration school in Oberhausen was struggling with a class made up of 34 pupils from nine different countries.\nThere were problems with aggressive behaviour and fights between different ethnic groups.\nBut now some of the older pupils have moved on to other schools and the number of pupils in her class has fallen to 12, although still of several different nationalities.\n\"We have a different atmosphere now. It's calm, it's peaceful,\" she says. \"The pupils are motivated and they learn very rapidly, they want to learn and so fewer children means more time for every child.\"\nFor adults there are numerous state-run and non-governmental group initiatives aimed at helping them find work.\nBut one that has made headlines is Serap Tanis's women's empowerment group, the Courage Project. The local group aims to help newly arrived immigrants and refugees realise their potential while living in Germany.\nMs Tanis, the project leader, is herself an immigrant of Turkish descent. She moved to Germany from Istanbul when she was six years old. She compares herself to a pearl diver, believing that \"there is a 'treasure in everyone hidden deep below\".\nThrough discussion groups she helps women to think about education and employment in a new light. However, Ms Tanis is keen to stress she's not trying to turn them into Germans or transform them overnight.\n\"Empowerment is a process and we give them the courage to find their strength,\" she says.\nRoudin Davo and her family arrived seven months ago One of the women she is helping is Roudin Davo, a Syrian Kurd who fled from Kobane in Northern Syria after jihadist group Islamic State captured the city in October 2014.\nShe arrived in Oberhausen in April 2016 after a treacherous journey through Europe with her husband and two young daughters.\n\"We lost everything, but here we try to begin again from the bottom,\" says Mrs Davo.\n\"Before [in Syria] I thought: I am a mother, I have to stay at home. But then my friends told me there is a school where they look after my girls and I can learn German.\"\nIt's difficult to know whether schemes like the Courage Project have helped refugees into work, but unemployment in Oberhausen has fallen this year from 11.7% in March to 10.3% in October.\nThat is still far higher than the 6% average across Germany.\nFar-right demonstrators meet opposition in Oberhausen from supporters of the migrants When BBC News last visited Oberhausen in April its Chief Police Inspector Tom Litges said there was a sense of fear towards refugees among some of Oberhausen's residents following the New Year's Eve sex attacks in nearby Cologne.\nSome of Oberhausen's residents even began calling for civil patrols. But nothing ever came of it and the fear has dissipated.\n\"There haven't been any serious crimes related to migrants in the last six months,\" says Chief Inspector Litges.\nBut right-wing activists have been targeting the city. Since April, there have been two anti-immigration rallies - made up of about 70 far-right protestors, mainly from neighbouring Essen.\nRefugees and unemployment 211,888\npopulation of Oberhausen\n2,593\nare refugees\n649 asylum-seekers are from Syria\n257 are from Afghanistan and 257 are from Iraq\n11,318 people in the town are unemployed (10.3% unemployment rate)\n1,141 of them are under 25 (10.2% youth unemployment rate)\nSource: Oberhausen City Council, Nov 2016 The right-wing nationalist party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), has been growing in popularity since it started in 2013 and now has MPs in nine of Germany's 16 state parliaments - although none in North Rhine-Westphalia.\n\"Every now and then what we do have is [right-wing] demonstrations and usually those who are against the right-wing demonstrators are normally five, six, seven times more [in number], says Chief Inspector Litges.\n\"So for that reason the people of Oberhausen show that they do no accept right-wing propaganda.\"\nThe BBC will return to Oberhausen in six months to find out what happens next.",

Her new results show that her cognitive intelligence, her perception and her memory have all greatly improved. \nAccording to her latest supervised test, her IQ is now evaluated at 220, making her smarter than Stephen Hawkins, Albert Einstein and Leonardo Da Vinci, and placing her among the most intelligent people in human history ... The Chair of Mensa International, Bibiána Balanyi, says that Ms Franklin could now be one of the three most intelligent people in history. \nThe image that was included along with the story was taken from a 4 August 2015 advertisement for a game called \"Mensa Brain Training\"; the clip from which the image was taken provided no name for the woman, and the app was for a game, not membership in Mensa: \n\nA second attached image was labeled as \"Bibiána Balanyi,\" head of Mensa International. Although Balanyi was indeed named head of Mensa in July 2015, the photograph included did not show more than a passing resemblance to her: \nThe sensational and clickbaiting subject is typical of the output from WNDR , a fake news site that solely publishes outlandish fabricated and often salacious or titillating stories. \nWNDR often snatches unrelated images from the internet to illustrate their false claims, as evidenced by the \"Alicia Franklin\" image swiped from an app commercial. Their material inevitably generates traffic via social media, but there was no truth to the claim that the nonexistent Franklin (or any other individual) demonstrated cognitive gains thanks to the regular ingestion of sperm or semen.

Not surprised that the Fisher football family decided to take matters into their own hands. Thank you!” \n“One of the coolest things I have seen done,” another commenter wrote. “It was awesome.” \n“God bless our Cardinals!!!” another fan exclaimed. “This was one class act!!!” \nWhile St. John Fisher fell to Frostburg 38-14, their players’ patriotism likely will be what sticks in people’s minds.",

The first was Funny or Die Presents: Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie —an entertaining, extended jab at this year's GOP presidential nominee. The second was Al Gore's documentary, An Inconvenient Truth .\nRELATED ARTICLES Kamala Harris So Concerned About Trump Threat She Wants to Make It Harder to Criticize Him Ed Krayewski | 11.21.16 \nLena Dunham Goes Hardcore Cultural Appropriation In Pro-Hillary Clinton Rap Video Anthony L.

And yet to three members of the Federal Election Commission, it is anything but.\nThe FEC is split evenly between Republicans and Democrats. This leads to many stalemates and causes much teeth-grinding rage among those who would like it to crack down harder on political speech, especially by incorporated nonprofits such as the NRA and Planned Parenthood , which spend money on elections without disclosing their donors.\nIn the instance at hand, it was not the Republicans but the Democrats who shrank from endorsing what should be the fundamental right to distribute movies. After all, the Supreme Court has made it plain that \"moving pictures, like newspapers and radio, are included in the press whose freedom is guaranteed by the First Amendment.\"\nRegarding that point Lee Goodman, one of the three Republican members (and a former counsel to the Virginia GOP), recently tried to have some language—just a few words, actually—inserted into a notice of proposed rulemaking. The language would have made it clear that the \"press exemption\" in campaign-finance regulations applies not only to newspapers, magazines, and TV but also to movies, books, and streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.\nThat campaign-finance regulations have a \"press exemption\" in the first place is what poker players would call a tell, and what you and I would call a dead giveaway. The exemption is necessary because without it newspapers, TV networks, and similar media would routinely be in violation of the law whenever they carried anything that might be construed as support for, or opposition to, a political candidate. They are, after all, corporations—and campaign finance laws strictly limit corporate involvement in elections.\nThe media exemption helps explain why most coverage of campaign-finance regulation paints it as woefully inadequate: Media organizations can agitate for restrictions on political speech by other types of corporations, secure in the knowledge that they enjoy special protection from the rules that apply to everyone else.\nBut that could change if the makeup of the FEC ever changes. When The New York Times lashed out at the FEC for being an \"impotent joke\" and demanded that it be replaced by a new agency—one that can be stacked in favor of more regulation—FEC Commissioner Ann Ravel tweeted , \"Finally: my concerns are being heard.\" (Translation: Head of Government Agency Agrees Government Agency Should Have More Power.)\nWhen Goodman proposed language stipulating that books, movies, and streaming services should be treated according to the same First Amendment principles that protect newspapers and magazines, Ravel joined her two Democratic colleagues in opposition.\nRavel claimed she was concerned about timing: \"None of us have had an opportunity to really review and think about\" Goodman's proposal, she said. First, that wasn't true; Goodman had circulated it months before. More importantly, how much reviewing and thinking should be needed to agree that books and movies are covered by the First Amendment?\nQuite a lot, apparently. In another recent case, a right-wing movie-maker made a movie, \"Dreams From My Real Father,\" contending that Barack Obama is really the son of a communist, and then mailed millions of copies to voters in swing states. (The premise was so ridiculous that it actually turned off Republicans in a focus group.)\nWhen a complaint against the movie was lodged at the FEC, the three Republican commissioners ruled that it was covered by the media exemption. The three Democratic commissioners ruled otherwise. One of them, Ellen Weintraub, explained her reasoning succinctly: Noting that the press exception depends on \"whether the press entity was acting as a press entity,\" she asserted that \"press entities do not act as press entities when they distribute millions of free DVDs immediately before an election solely in electoral swing states.\" Oh? What about free newspapers? Free magazines?\nIn a June case this year, the FEC took up the question as to whether Fox News' two-tiered arrangement during its Aug. 6 debate last year violated federal regulations. Two commissioners—Ravel and Steven Walther, another member of the Democratic bloc—voted to take enforcement action against Fox. A subsequent vote on a measure stipulating that the FEC lacks the authority to regulate how news organizations run debates failed on a 3-3 partisan vote.\nAll of this should alarm members of the media for two reasons. First, newspapers are now producing video on a regular basis.\nThey also publish books, such as the Washington Post 's \" Trump Revealed \" (available on Amazon, at Barnes & Noble, and on Audible). Such works include news content, but then so do many other movies and books produced by non-media sources. It is not clear why the former should be exempt from regulation if the latter are not.\nThe other reason to be alarmed is that the Democratic members of the FEC seem to think they can, as Goodman puts it, \"sit in judgment of ... news directors' editorial criteria\"—and that while they can do so only rarely at present, they would like to do it much more.\nThey might just get the chance. Hillary Clinton has promised that, if elected, she will propose a constitutional amendment in her first 30 days so that the First Amendment no longer can limit the reach of campaign-finance law. If she does, the media might finally wake up to the implications of such a proposal. But by that point, it might be too late.\nThis column originally appeared at the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\nPhoto Credit: swruler9284/flickr",

    "text": "comment () \nBuckingham Palace hasn’t quite turned into a fixer upper, but the centuries-old mansion is definitely showing its age. \nThe home of Queen Elizabeth is in need of roughly 369 million pounds (about $455 million) worth of major repairs. The fixes will “future proof” the palace and prevent putting it at risk from fire, flood and other danger, the palace said in a statement and at a news conference. Getty Images During this past summer's Trooping the Colour, a fly-past of aircrafts pass above Buckingham Palace, which will get major updates beginning April 2017. \nAbout 100 miles of electric cables, much of it 60 years old, along with lead pipes, thousands of light fixtures and wall outlets, and about 2,500 radiators will be fixed during the renovation. \nWork will begin in April and will last for the next 10 years. The queen, who turned 90 earlier this year , will remain in residence during the construction. AFP - Getty Images A portion of the White Drawing Room inside Buckingham Palace. \nPalace officials estimate that once benefits, energy efficiencies and inflation are taken into account, the actual price tag of of the work will be about 222 million pounds ($274 million). \nThe renovations will be paid partially through a temporary 10 percent increase in the Sovereign Grant, the account funded by the United Kingdom government to maintain the operational costs of running the queen’s household and the crown estate. Getty Images Queen Elizabeth meets with Angelina Jolie inside Buckingham Palace in 2014, when the actress was named an honorary dame for her humanitarian work. \nNews of the publicly-funded repairs led to the creation of a petition demanding that the royal family foot the bill for the palace renovations. More than 12,000 people have signed the petition, which questions why the monarchy was getting so much additional money during a national housing crisis and period of austerity. \n“Now the Royals expect us to dig deeper to refurbish Buckingham Palace,” the petition states. “The Crown's wealth is inestimable.

Yair Lapid.   \nThe Palestinians need to work on building a state for themselves instead of focusing on terror and death, Yesh Atid chairman Yair Lapid said at The   Conference in the capital Wednesday.Lapid recounted his participation in pro-Israel events in Europe, on the outskirts of which protesters chanted \"free Palestine,\" and asked what kind of freedom the Palestinians are seeking.   \"Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela knew something about freedom that those protestors do not understand. They knew that freedom is not just a gift you are given. Freedom is a responsibility...a moral duty,\" he said. As someone who is committed to a two-state solution, Lapid said, he needs to know what kind of state the Palestinians want to build.\"What is their version of freedom?\" he asked. \"What price are they willing to pay for it? What responsibilities are they willing to take upon themselves?\"Lapid pointed out that the PA has existed for over 20 years and Israelis do not have a presence in Palestinian cities except when there are security needs. The Palestinians, he said, have built a corrupt governing system without an effective judiciary or modern industry. Palestinians did not use the resources Israel left behind in Gaza, and instead they voted in Hamas, who shot rockets at Israel .In addition, the \"Palestinian education system poisons the minds of six and seven-years-olds, every single day, with antisemitic propaganda of the worst kind.\"That's not freedom. When they tell their children that Jews are monkeys and pigs, they are not marching towards the liberation of Palestine, they are putting new chains on their own ankles,\" he added.Lapid also detailed the way Palestinian terrorists and their families receive a salary from the PA, which uses the donations they receive from other countries.\"Instead of building something, instead of creating something, they choose a culture of murder and destruction,\" he stated.The Yesh Atid leader asked if that is what the European protesters want freed.\"Free the people who hang gays from telephone poles. Free the people who beat their wives. Free the people who want to kill Jews. Free the people who burn down churches. Free them. Don’t ask what stands behind them, don’t ask what they really want,\" he said of the activists.\"The world wants to free Palestine. We have the right to ask what is it that they want to free in our back yard?\" Lapid asked.Lapid described Palestinians who carry keys to their forebears' homes in Haifa and Safed and said that they wouldn't have had to leave if the Arabs had accepted the 1947 Partition Plan, but in any case, they should focus less on the past and more on the future.\"In the words of Alan Dershowitz – maybe, grow up already?\" he quipped. \"Israel has over six million Jews who could travel the world with a key. Keys to homes in Iraq, in Morocco, in Iran and Algeria. Keys in Poland, in Germany, in Hungary. We don’t do that because self-pity is not an efficient policy.\" Lapid called on the Palestinians to \"free [themselves] from the past and go build a future. If you do that, we will be the first to help you.\"  ",

    "text": "By Amy Shojai, CABC Updated February 19, 2016 . \nThere are several kinds of cat aggression, and more than one can happen at the same time. The more types Kitty shows and the longer they’re allowed to go on, the poorer becomes the prognosis for improvement. \nCats rarely aggress towards people when they live with other cats. They’d rather challenge other kitties than argue with the two-leggers with wallets who fill the food bowl. Aggression isn’t limited to bared fangs, though, because feline aggression can be quite subtle. \nSigns range from outright attacks to urine spraying , or glares and stares that make the other cat move. It’s normal for adult cats to aggress toward strange animals that trespass on their territory, which makes new cat introductions a challenge for owners. But cats are champion poker-players and despite furious yowls and posturing, they bluff so well that fur rarely flies. \nDominance displays more often are so subtle that you may never know any controversy took place. Body language from face-front silent confrontations, to thumping tails or lowered ears can send less confident cats scurrying for cover. \nAlmost all types of aggression have a fear or anxiety component . This holds true especially during pet introductions or in multiple cat households where dynamics often shift with age, health status, and stress levels. \nOftentimes, people accidentally encourage aggression when they reward bad behavior by allowing the cat to get his way. For instance, if they cut short the grooming when the cat hisses, Sheba subsequently “generalizes” the lesson and uses a hiss or leave-me-alone-bite to control other interactions. \nDon’t argue with a cat that’s aggressing. You’ll only make it worse. Owners who act anxious or threatening in the cat’s presence further aggravate feline aggression . And the more a cat “practices” the better he’ll become at using aggression as a fail-safe behavior to get his way. \nRecognize potential triggers and understand warning signs of aggression to avoid or diffuse aggression. Common aggression triggers include: When feeling pain When a deaf or blind cat is startled When approached/disturbed while resting When overcrowded by too many cats for the space When protecting resources (bed, territory, kittens) When physically and/or verbally disciplined When forced to make prolonged eye contact When experiencing unwelcome handling (being held, petted, lifted) When restrained, or forced into unwelcome position When hearing certain music frequencies or high pitched sounds (i.e., baby crying, violin playing) When suffering from physical health conditions ( hyperthyroidism , hyperesthesia syndrome ). \nMost cats learn early on how to wrangle without physically hurting each other. Kitties have exquisite control of their teeth and claws, and know how to pull punches to keep damage to a minimum. They posture, show teeth and swipe claws near (but not in contact with) the target, rather than biting. This allows them to resolve differences without hurting each other.",

Related articles Finland scrambles jets TWICE in one day to intercept Russia' warplanes \nHe said: “This missile would easily outrange any American - or other NATO - air-to-air missile. \n“Reports are that the size would put it into the category of a very long range air to air missile (VLRAAM) with ranges exceeding 186 miles, likely max out between 250 and 310 miles.' \n“Additionally, the VLRAAM's powerful rocket engine will push it to Mach 6 speeds, which will increase the no escape zone (NEZ), that is the area where a target cannot outrun the missile, against even supersonic targets like stealth fighters.” \nWith a new radar system, missile is also understood to have a thrust boost to supplement its manoeuvrability. \nLast year a Chinese scientific journal reported that once fired by a fighter jet, a VLRAAM could fly 15km upwards to a 30km altitude before it is guided by long range radars to hurtle at hypersonic aircraft into stealth bombers and fighter jets to destroy them.

    "text": "How to deal with worries about stranded assets Oil companies need to heed investors’ concerns Nov 26th 2016 Tweet \nIN SEPTEMBER 2015, at a candlelit dinner at Lloyd’s of London, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, addressed the insurance industry on climate change. He gave warning in advance that there would be no jokes. Then he dropped a bombshell on the oil industry. \nHis message was twofold. First, if the world seriously intended to limit global warming to 2ºC, most of the coal, oil and gas reserves in the ground would be left “stranded”, or unrecoverable. Such “transition risk” could jeopardise financial stability, he argued. Second, a task force would be set up to prompt companies to disclose how they planned to manage risks and prepare for a 2ºC world, similar to the one created to improve risk disclosure by banks after the financial crisis. \nEver since that speech, oil companies have been incensed by the idea that they may be the next Lehman Brothers. Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, talks of financial regulators trying to “weaponise financial markets against oil and gas”. Patrick Pouyanné, the boss of Total, has urged Mr Carney to “take care of the pound, not the oil industry”. \nBut Mr Carney’s remarks presaged a change in attitude towards oil companies by governments, financial regulators and investors that has become clearer since the Paris climate-change agreement last December. The Securities and Exchange Commission, America’s stockmarket regulator, is investigating whether ExxonMobil, the country’s biggest oil company, values its untapped reserves appropriately in light of the recent halving of oil prices and potential regulatory action on climate change. In October it said it might write down about one-fifth of its reserves. The company has faced related probes by New York’s attorney-general, Eric Schneiderman. \nActivist shareholders have had unprecedented support from mainstream investors for their efforts to force oil companies to explain how their businesses would be changed by full-scale decarbonisation. Total, Shell and BHP Billiton, a coal and oil company, were ahead of the field, issuing reports in the past 12 months that outlined scenarios for a move to 2ºC warming. \nAmerican oil firms prefer to dig in their heels, arguing that market forces are a better way to reduce emissions than “international accords or government initiatives”. They note that thanks to the shale-gas revolution in America, emissions last year were 12% lower than a decade earlier. Such attitudes risk causing more of a backlash towards the most resistant companies. BlackRock, a big asset manager, estimates that more than 500 investment firms, with assets of $3.4trn under management, have pledged to divest from fossil-fuel companies. It says that when financial fiduciaries decide where to invest, they should now consider the climate impact as well as the likely returns. \nBevis Longstreth, a former SEC commissioner (and climate activist), says such exhortations can have a ripple effect throughout the investment community. Local governments are beginning to unwind their oil and gas investments. It reminds him of the rush to disinvest from big companies that traded with South Africa under apartheid in the 1980s. “It’s like getting out of the theatre when you smell smoke.” Stranded by guesswork \nYet the industry’s tetchy reaction to the questions raised over the value of its reserves is partly justified. Mr Schneiderman’s probe of ExxonMobil has cast this way and that, like a wildcatter desperately looking for oil. Because oil prices go up and down so much, estimating and valuing reserves is fiendishly hard. It is even harder to predict what regulators might do to counter climate change. \nAs for Mr Carney’s worry about stranded assets, the industry argues that it is premature. Countries like Saudi Arabia may have reserves estimated to last 70 years, but oil companies’ proven reserves are much shorter-range, typically 10-15 years. IHS, a research firm, estimates that about 80% of the value of most listed oil companies is based on proven reserves that will be used within that time frame. Daniel Yergin, IHS’s vice-chairman, also points out that the recent collapse in oil prices posed no threat to the stability of the financial system, even though the shock was more abrupt than climate change is likely to turn out. He thinks Mr Carney has overstepped the mark. If measures to stop global warming are fully implemented, oil-company revenues could fall by more than $22trn over the next 25 years \nAll the same, the industry may come under further pressure. Under the aegis of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a body administered by the Group of 20 that monitors the global financial system (and is chaired by Mr Carney), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures is drawing up global guidelines, due to be presented to the FSB in December, for voluntary disclosure on how to manage climate risks. Members of the task force acknowledge that these risks may be tricky to account for on the balance-sheet, especially as it is not clear what future regulations governments will impose. IHS argues that such rules could harm fossil-fuel companies by putting off lenders and giving an advantage to state-owned rivals that would not face the same pressures from investors. \nOne of the advisers to the task force, Mark Lewis, of Barclays, says that if measures to stop global warming are fully implemented, oil-company revenues could fall by more than $22trn over the next 25 years, more than twice the predicted decline for the gas and coal industries combined. Mr Lewis sees a cautionary tale in the woes of European utilities, hit by government action to penalise coal and nuclear power. They have suffered such a devastating collapse in their share prices in recent years that some of the biggest, including Germany’s E.ON, have been forced to split off their fossil-fuel businesses. If the big oil companies are encouraged to discuss climate-change risks openly, they will have a better chance of avoiding such a fate.",

    "text": "at 4:38pm CDT \n4:33pm: There is optimism that a lockout can be avoided, ESPN’s Jayson Stark writes . Stark cites two sources who tell him there is a “ path to a deal .” Both sides, however, seem to believe that the lockout suggests December 1 is a “ hard deadline ” to reach an agreement. If there were to be a lockout in December, it wouldn’t necessarily result in missed games, but it could delay the progress of the offseason and cut off player benefits. \nTODAY, 12:32pm: ESPN.com’s Buster Olney writes ( Insider link ) that there’s no particular reason to think that the saber-rattling will lead to a significant interference in labor relations, stating his own “educated guess” that compromise will be found. Sources do tell him that the league side is indeed “incredibly frustrated” by the union’s foot-dragging and unwillingness to move on issues like the international draft. And that could still lead to a standoff that impacts the progress of this winter’s trade and free agent markets. But as Olney explains, there’s relatively little at stake in the talks (in relation to the immense amount of money that both sides are making) and plenty of time before the owners and union would risk interfering with the 2017 season. \nYESTERDAY: Major League Baseball’s owners “will consider” instituting a player lockout if a new collective bargaining agreement between the league and the MLB Player’s Association can’t be found, according to a report from Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports . The current CBA is set to expire on December 1st, and the sides are said to be at an impasse over several matters. \nThis is the first time we’ve heard a firm report suggesting that there could be a work stoppage — though, of course, there’s no imminent threat to actual baseball games with Spring Training not set to begin until mid-February and the regular season still four months off. It has long been assumed that the owners and union would resolve any differences, particularly given that the game has continued to experience growth in revenue, but talks have dragged on longer than expected. \nIn considering a lockout, the owners would be threatening to interfere with the conduct of the offseason’s business, much of which remains to be completed. Some have suggested that a failure to reach agreement by the new deadline might result in a continuation of the status quo; presumably, that’s still also a possibility. But if a deal can’t be struck and the owners take a hard line, it might well result in a freeze on transactions right before the Winter Meetings. \nIt’s important to bear in mind that there are strategic reasons for suggesting the possibility of a lockout, which would require a vote of ownership to be instituted. And with just over a week left to finish negotiations, there’s still time for a resolution. Commissioner Rob Manfred says he’s still “committed to the idea that we’re going to make an agreement before expiration,” while union chief Tony Clark declined comment. \nThe sides are certainly jockeying for position on the remaining issues; no doubt, each is familiar with the other’s positions at this stage. The key matters yet to be determined are, however, rather notable. According to Rosenthal, the owners offered to get rid of any tying of free agents to draft compensation (as currently embodied in the qualifying offer system), but requested an international draft in exchange. The union, it seems, has lined up behind the idea that the draft would be too onerous. \nThere’s also disagreement regarding the competitive-balance tax and the Joint Drug Agreement. As to the former issue, it seems largely a matter of divvying up dollars and figuring out ways to ensure that teams put any subsidies into their major league roster. With regard to the latter, it seems that all are agreed on the need to add force to the JDA, but the players are asking to be compensated in exchange. \nRosenthal spoke with sources to get a read of the situation, and his article is well worth a full read. The takeaway seems to be that there’s still a path toward completing an agreement before the CBA expires, but the players are also prepared to dig in their heels. There’s certainly much to be lost for both sides in the event of a serious labor dispute, and that fact remains the best reason to retain hope that a lockout can be avoided. While this bit of brinkmanship is hardly determinitive, though, it’s also a notable sign that there have been real difficulties in seeing eye to eye.",

    "text": "Home » News » Trump begs Americans Trump begs Americans 8:25 am In News , Politics by adekunle Comments \nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump has called on Americans to “speak with one voice and one heart” after a long and bruising political campaign. \nTrump’s plea was made in a video posted on YouTube after he announced the selection Wednesday of two more Cabinet officials on Wednesday. \nThe officials are South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley who was appointed as ambassador to the United Nations and Michigan billionaire Betsy DeVos who would work as secretary of Education. \n“It is my prayer, that on this Thanksgiving, we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country, strengthened by a shared purpose and very, very common resolve.. \n“We have just finished a long and bruising political campaign; emotions are raw and tensions just don’t heal overnight. \n“It doesn’t go quickly, unfortunately, but we have before us the chance now to make history together to bring real change to Washington, real safety to our cities, and real prosperity to our communities, including our inner cities. \n“This is so important to me and to our country. But to succeed, we must enlist the effort of our entire nation,” Trump said. \nDonald Trump began to broaden the base of his future cabinet Wednesday, nominating two conservative women including a critic, after his earlier picks rewarded campaign loyalists. \nTrump’s nomination of South Carolina’s 44-year-old governor, Nikki Haley, as US ambassador to the United Nations will be seen as a sign he is ready to forgive some foes to raise a bigger tent. \nBut his choice of wealthy activist Betsy DeVos, a champion of alternatives to local government schools, as education secretary, was another victory for social conservatives. \nTrump’s one-time presidential rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, appeared to be next in line for the nod — reportedly as housing secretary — after he posted on social media that an announcement was imminent. \nTrump’s choice of Haley for the UN was announced amid reports that Trump is considering another vocal critic — former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney — for the key post of secretary of state. \nAnd it followed a cordial chat between Trump and The New York Times, a newspaper he considers hostile, in which he softened his stance on climate change, torture and prosecuting his defeated rival Hillary Clinton. \nThe 70-year-old property tycoon also told the Times that he is “seriously, seriously considering” appointing widely respected retired Marine general James Mattis as his defense secretary. \nThe UN ambassador post is of cabinet rank and if Haley — a staunch conservative with no foreign policy experience — is confirmed by the Senate she will become a powerful figure in world diplomacy, despite previously clashing with Trump. \nAs one of two women tapped so far for Trump’s cabinet, the daughter of Indian immigrants also injects a measure of diversity in a group that until now consisted solely of men. \n– Murdered churchgoers – \nLast year, after a white supremacist murdered nine black churchgoers in South Carolina, Haley supported a decision by legislators to remove the Confederate flag from the state house. \nThe decision drew protests from racist groups. This year, while campaigning for Trump’s primary rival Marco Rubio, Haley called Trump out for his failure to repudiate the Ku Klux Klan. \n“I will not stop until we fight a man that chooses not to disavow the KKK. That is not a part of our party. That is not who we are,” she declared. \nTrump, true to form, responded with one of his trademark Twitter insults, declaring: “The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley!” \nTrump’s choice last week of the self-described “economic nationalist” Steve Bannon, head of the right-wing news platform Breitbart, as his chief strategist delighted white supremacists. \nBut on Tuesday, after video emerged of fans of the so-called alt-right making straight-armed salutes and chanting “Hail Trump,” the president-elect disavowed the movement. \n– Campaign rhetoric – \nAs he works with his advisers in his luxury Mar-a-Lago golf resort outside Palm Beach, all eyes will be on the appointments he makes for a sign of the direction his administration will take. TRUMP When it comes to security threats and global issues, the president-elect has reportedly received just two classified intelligence briefings since winning the presidency, far less than his immediate predecessors, according to the Washington Post newspaper. \nThe Republican’s limited engagement with his team of intelligence analysts has some officials questioning the real estate mogul’s commitment to national security or international affairs, arenas in which he has no significant experience. \nWhen Trump’s November 8 election victory still seemed an unlikely prospect, many Republicans and conservative policy experts condemned his anti-Muslim rhetoric, his affinity for Russia or his isolationist and protectionist positions. \nMany of these figures are now moderating their tone and looking for work, whether they are lured by the prospect of a powerful job or are keen to serve US interests as a moderating influence inside a Trump administration. \nThe former Iraq and Afghan war commander, retired general David Petraeus — who resigned as head of the CIA after he was caught sharing classified data with his mistress — made his pitch on Wednesday. \n“If you’re asked, you’ve got to serve, put aside any reservations based on campaign rhetoric, and figure out what’s best for the country,” he told BBC Radio. \nIn May, Petraeus described hardline rhetoric like Trump’s threat to ban all Muslims from traveling to the United States as “toxic” and “corrosive to our vital national security interests.” \nThis week a Trump aide was photographed carrying notes on a border security plan into Trump Tower. The first three points were legible in the picture, and pointed to stringent vetting for Muslim visa applicants. \nTrump and his family will stay at Mar-a-Lago through Thursday’s Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend. More meetings will be held on Monday with transition officials, his press office said. \nMeanwhile, erstwhile Democratic candidate Clinton — who lost to Trump by carrying a minority of the electoral college which decides the election outcome — saw her national lead in the popular vote tally pass two million votes. adekunle",

    "text": "FRANKFURT/HAMBURG Just as Porsche and Audi have fought for supremacy on the race track, the Volkswagen brands are now locked in a cut-throat battle to develop and manufacture the next generation of electric cars at a group embroiled in the \"Dieselgate\" scandal.\nVolkswagen Group denies that the kind of internal rivalry that it encouraged at the Le Mans 24 hour race is getting out of hand in the boardroom.\nBut senior executives told Reuters that in-house conflict, particularly between VW and its premium brands, is intensifying over which factories will develop next generation cars while the German group has to cut costs elsewhere to pay for cleaning up its emissions cheating scandal.\n\"There is a cut-throat battle for resources. Every brand with engine-manufacturing capacity now wants a leadership role when it comes to electric motors, battery packs and battery-cell expertise,\" an executive at one of the VW divisions, who declined to be named, said.\nSince returning to top-line racing three years ago, Porsche has beaten Audi to the world championship for sportscars and at Le Mans for the past two seasons.\nPorsche will again seek to defend the titles in 2017 with its ultra-sophisticated petrol hybrids. But Audi, whose hybrid racers showcased the group's troubled diesel technology, has pulled out after winning the French race 13 times.\nIn the broader competition, Porsche also appears in the ascendant as Audi - which since the 1990s has achieved rapid sales growth to rival Mercedes-Benz and BMW - now struggles with the Dieselgate fallout and a series of negative press leaks.\nJobs are at stake as the group - whose brands also include Skoda, SEAT, Bugatti, Bentley and Lamborghini - moves to new technology and faces up to Dieselgate penalties and lawsuits which analysts say could cost as much as 30 billion euros ($32 billion).\nBecause electric cars are far less complex to assemble than traditional combustion engine vehicles, manufacturers may not be able to guarantee the same level of employment in future - a thorny issue in an industry dominated by a workforce with multi-year collective wage agreements.\nVolkswagen and its unions agreed to cut 30,000 jobs at the core VW brand in exchange for a commitment to avoid forced redundancies in Germany until 2025.\nThe executives at Audi, VW and Porsche, who all declined to be named, said conflict between group brands is not new and healthy internal competition can push them to greater technical and commercial achievements.\nHowever, some critics said the scramble has become more intense partly because the company last year lost a powerful central figure who controlled the balance of power between the brands, their managers and worker representatives.\nThat balance is now being redefined, pitting Volkswagen, one of the group's least profitable mass market brands, against its highly profitable siblings Porsche and Audi.\nVolkswagen dismissed this analysis, and denied that an unhealthy power struggle was underway at all. \"This is pure speculation which lacks any kind of foundation and is something which we emphatically reject,\" spokesman Eric Felber said.\nGroup chief executive Matthias Mueller has previously worked as Audi's head of product management and Porsche boss. But since getting the top job after the scandal erupted last year, he has yet to build the level of power once enjoyed by former chairman Ferdinand Piech, whose extended family controls the firm.\nPiech, who spent years cultivating ties to VW's powerful labor leaders, was an engineering genius who inspired fierce loyalty from staff because of his willingness to take risks. He masterminded the Porsche 917 racer, which starred alongside Steve McQueen in the 1971 movie \"Le Mans\", as well as the legendary Audi Quattro rally car of the 1980s.\nPiech also turned Audi into one of the main research and development hubs for the 12-brand group, although eventually he lost a separate power struggle, quitting as chairman last year.\n\nBRAIN DRAIN\nWhile the main contributor to VW group profit, Audi has lost some battles in recent years for developing vehicle components to the smaller Porsche brand, and is also competing with the VW brand to develop next generation zero-emission cars. \nSince diesel cheating was exposed, Audi has lost two research and development chiefs and the head of its automotive electronics division who did pioneering work in the area of autonomous driving and battery technology. \nIt appointed a new development chief on Friday but Audi and its Chief Executive Rupert Stadler remain under fire for the brand's involvement in the cheating in emissions tests. \nMeanwhile, Porsche - a firm that VW swallowed up in 2012 - has emerged as a strong rival engineering center. \nPorsche's MSB platform, used for its four-seater Panamera model, has been adopted for the next generation Bentley Continental even though Audi had developed a similar offering. \nPorsche has also taken over production of eight-cylinder gasoline engines for large sportscars for the VW group, even though Audi has its own engine factory in Hungary. \n\"For Audi, it has always been difficult to accept if Porsche gets something. They tried to resist the Porsche platform but in the end, a business decision was made,\" a Porsche source said.\nAudi is not out in the cold. It remains the centre of excellence for sports utility vehicles, a lucrative and growing market, where it supplies platforms to Porsche and other brands such as Bentley. With self-driving vehicles likely to play a major future role in the industry, Audi also develops autonomous cars for the group.\nOn the race track, Audi will compete in the Formula E electric-car championship.\nNevertheless, analysts say VW must not neglect it in allocating resources. \"Some successful divisions like Audi need to be nurtured,\" said Juergen Pieper at Metzler Bank.\n\nJOBS AND BEER\nA separate internal race has begun to become an engineering hub for electric vehicles, a field which includes research and development of battery cells, battery packs and electric motors, in the hope of preserving local jobs. Porsche has developed the J1 electric cars platform, creating 1,000 jobs at its plant outside the southwestern city of Stuttgart, while the Volkswagen brand made its own MEB platform for conventional passenger cars in Lower Saxony, and pledged to create 9,000 jobs in developing autonomous and electric vehicles. \nThe Volkswagen brand will spend 2.5 billon euros to develop electric cars, the company said.\nAudi is working on its own electric car at its Bavarian base but it is unclear whether it will develop its own electric car platform now that the Volkswagen brand is to establish itself as a centre for battery cells, battery packs and electric motors.\nSome senior executives say the fierce competition between brands is nothing unusual. But others point to press reports that appeared during the final days of VW's future pact negotiations as an example of a more abrasive power struggle, although the source of the leaks remains unclear.\nIn July, German paper Bild am Sonntag reported that internal auditors had ordered Stadler to repay 12,500 euros in expenses spent on a beer-drinking contest.\nThen on Nov. 6 it said California's Air Resources Board had discovered a new software-cheating device in Audi cars. The report appeared as Audi tried to secure a final deal with U.S. regulators on compensating owners of cars with Audi-built motors. \nOn Nov. 11, Der Spiegel weekly said VW supervisory board members were discussing possible successors for Stadler, but a senior source dismissed this. \"There is no reason why Rupert Stadler cannot continue as Audi's chief executive,\" he said.\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Irene Preisinger, Ilona Wissenbach, Andreas Cremer and David Shepardson; editing by David Stamp)",

According to Eng Munira Abdul Kareem, manager of the Ministry of Infrastructure Development's Project Execution Department, the department is geared up to adopt 3D printing technologies in the future. \"All the buildings to be built in the future by the ministry across the UAE will be 3D-printed in line with the national agenda of the country and the UAE 2021 vision.\" The ministry will organise over 20 workshops and launch many other initiatives to support the country's infrastructure development and boost sustainable development here, she added.\"Using 3D printing technology will cut construction costs by 80 per cent, and save up to 70 per cent of the time needed, and 50 per cent of manpower required.\" These are apart from the incomparable flexibility of the aspired building designs, regardless of their heights and sizes, she explained. \"The 3D technology is also beneficial in terms of less power consumption and harmful emissions which may only hit 25 to 30 per cent.\" 3D printing - according to some construction industry accounts - could reduce labour costs by 50 to 80 per cent and construction waste by 30 to 60 per cent, while also compressing the construction schedule from months to weeks. \"Seeking to corner this emerging market, firms have used or proposed the use of 3D printers to build novel structures ranging from high-rise villas to disaster-relief shelters to research outposts on Mars,\" Abdul Kareem pointed out. The ministry is also planning to introduce new innovative school building designs in the future, Abdul Kareem stated. \"We want to build smart schools as per the latest international standards adopted in modern schools worldwide.\" Lecturing on innovation keys, Eng Azza Sulaiman, an FNC member, said the concept must be observed in all government departments, and even become a lifestyle. \"The Innovation Week is an indication to the quantum leaps the UAE has made and how our prudent leaders care for our past, present and future, as well as our prosperity and welfare.\" - ahmedshaaban@khaleejtimes.com ",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama took on the problems of a lack of access to health care and high cost, but he and Democrats paid a political price. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to undo much of what Obama put in place, and pledged to make the system better. Although Trump is lacking in specifics, he seems to want to make costs his priority. States, insurers, businesses, and individuals would get more leeway to sort out access.\nHealth care keenly reflects the country's deep political divide. A look at some lessons Trump might learn from Obama's rough ride:\nTHE PERILS OF PROMISES\nObama promised that \"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\" But then several million people were threatened with the loss of policies that didn't conform to his overhaul. Obama said premiums would come down, too.\nTrump hasn't made such specific promises, yet it may already be too late for him. In the campaign, Trump made it sound like replacing the law would be quick and easy, and people would be widely satisfied with the results.\nConsider his idea for allowing insurers to sell policies across state lines. \"Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have yourself great plans,\" Trump said. That ignores practical issues such as whether an insurer in Houston can set up a viable network of doctors in New York.\n\"There are no easy solutions in health care,\" said Jim Capretta, a health policy expert with the business-oriented American Enterprise Institute. \"Whatever is done will necessarily involve some trade-offs, and winners and losers. There are political risks associated with every kind of policy proposal.\"\n___\nMEDICARE AND MEDICAID\nAs a candidate in 2008, then-Sen. Obama proposed requiring parents to get health insurance for their children, one of several steps to move toward coverage for all. As president, he embraced a broader \"individual mandate\" requiring most people to be covered. Enforced with fines from the IRS, it's been unpopular from the start.\nSeparately, Obama and a Democratic-led Congress financed part of the coverage expansion in the Affordable Care Act with cuts in Medicare payments to service providers. That was an unwelcome surprise to older people. Even if Medicare cuts improved the program's balance sheet, older voters helped deliver the House to Republicans in 2010, a few months after Obama signed the overhaul.\nTrump has promised not to cut Medicare, but Republican leaders in Congress want to revamp the program to provide future retirees with a fixed amount to purchase private insurance. Will Trump go along?\nTrump initially also said he wouldn't cut Medicaid, the health care program for low-income people. During the campaign, though, his views shifted to backing a \"block grant\" that would limit federal money to states and could result in big cuts.\nMedicare and Medicaid have been around for more than 50 years and are politically popular. Most people, including Republicans, don't equate the programs with the health law. So Trump could be left exposed.\n___\nGOING IT ALONE\nDemocrats passed the 2010 law over solid GOP opposition. Progressives blamed Republican obstinacy and said the overhaul contained many provisions with a centrist, even Republican, pedigree. But the lack of bipartisan support stoked years of opposition.\nTrump's ability to win over some Democrats will determine whether his ideas are remembered as a fleeting lurch to the political right or a lasting course correction.\nAt the moment, it's hard to detect any glimmer of bipartisanship.\n\"If President Trump succeeds in getting the ACA repealed, he and the Republicans will 'own' America's health care system,\" said Ron Pollack of Families USA, a leading advocate for Obama's law. \"As tens of millions of people lose coverage, the blame will go squarely onto the shoulders of those who engineered the repeal.\"\n___\nPEOPLE LIVE HERE\nWhen Obama signed the measure into law, Democrats hailed it as the fulfillment of historic aspirations to close the last major hole in the nation's social safety net.\nIf Trump gets to sign \"repeal and replace\" legislation, the rhetoric will be about getting government off people's backs and giving consumers the options they really needed.\nHow will the reality measure up?\nObama's law has been a lifeline for many people who previously could not get coverage. For others it brought unwanted legal obligations and expenses that burdened household budgets. The law did not hold back the trend of rising out-of-pocket costs for those with employer coverage.\nPeople worry about the overall affordability of their health care, said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Consumers have gotten savvy that out-of-pocket costs, which come on top of premiums, erode the value of their insurance card.\n\"Republicans may be tempted to push insurance premiums down by allowing insurers to offer skimpier coverage with fewer benefits and higher deductibles,\" he said. \"That's not likely to satisfy consumers in the end.\"",

    "text": "Five more 'avoidable' baby deaths in another Scottish maternity unit Questions are being asked about the standard of maternity care in Scotland Simon Johnson , Scottish Political Editor   \nS NP ministers are facing more questions over the standard of maternity services in Scotland’s hospitals after an NHS board apologised for the “potentially avoidable” deaths of another five babies. \nA report into the deaths at Caithness General Hospital in the Highlands found signs of illness were missed, midwives delayed seeking specialist help and labour was not properly supervised. \nNHS Highland offered an “unreserved” apology to the families of the babies, who were either stillborn or died soon after birth, and said the “model” for providing maternity care rather than staffing shortages was responsible. \nBut the disclosure of the Caithness cases came less than a week after it emerged six babies had died “unnecessarily” at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. \nIt was also reported that Shona Robison, the SNP Health Minister, was warned about problems in the latter’s maternity unit on at least 12 occasions before she ordered a review into its cases. Shona Robison is facing more questions about maternity care in Scotland Credit: Andrew MacColl/REX Shutterstock \nD onald Cameron, the Scottish Tories’ Shadow Health Minister, said: “These revelations are very alarming, and will give cause for concern to people all over Scotland. It's an incredibly sensitive area, and it now requires the utmost attention. \n\"Shona Robison is in charge of the health brief, and she must quickly set out in detail what action the Scottish Government is going to take.\" \nAnas Sarwar, Labour’s health spokesman, said the Caithness and Crosshouse reports were “heart-breaking” and called for a national review of staff and workforce issues across all maternity units. \nThe Scottish Mail on Sunday reported the findings of the 128-page report into neonatal and maternity services in Caithness, which will be discussed at an NHS Highland board meeting on Tuesday. \nThe review was ordered after medics failed to spot the early signs of blood poisoning in a two-day-old girl last September. The delay in seeking specialise help to deal with the sepsis infection, caused by E.coli, was found to have contributed to her death. \nFour other perinatal deaths involving “sub-optimal care” and “avoidable factors” were discovered to have taken place at the hospital between 2010 and 2015. \nIn one case a “high risk” young mother suffered a stillbirth when ten days overdue after the health board could not fund a bed for her. Another lost her child after giving birth at home, with medics failing to recognise the danger of her going into labour prematurely. \nNHS bosses will recommend the maternity unit is downgraded to a midwife service for “low-risk” mothers, with more complex cases being referred 100 miles away to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness, where there is 24-hour specialist cover and high dependency care. \nDr Roderick Harvey, the board’s medical director, said: “Families do rightly put their faith in the health service and the fact that infants died possibly as a result of sub-optimal care is unacceptable and I apologise unreservedly for these past failings.” \nHe said there had been no legal claims tabled by the families of the deceased babies and no staff had been disciplined as the problems identified “did not reflect on individual clinicians, but rather the system they work in.” \nWith only 165 local births per year, he said that the hospital’s three obstetricians “cannot maintain their skills” as they only intervene very infrequently and this is compounded by a lack of specialist neonatal support. \nDr Harvey concluded that they face an “impossible” situation of being pressurised to undertake specialist procedures “in a hospital that cannot provide that care” and predicted more avoidable deaths would happen if complex cases were handled there without the proper support. \nIt was also alleged yesterday that Ms Robison was repeatedly told about problems with maternity care in NHS Ayrshire and Arran by grieving relatives, campaigners and an SNP member. However, she was accused of failing to act until BBC Scotland reported last week on the six cases at Crosshouse Hospital. \nThe Scottish Health Minister said: “The safety of mothers and their babies is of paramount importance, which is why we must do everything we can to mitigate against similar incidents happening again.‎ Our deepest sympathies go out to the families who have been affected. \n“We want to ensure that every woman and baby in Scotland gets the best maternity and neonatal care and that is why we initiated a review of maternity and neonatal services across Scotland, which will report shortly.” Follow Telegraph News",

    "text": "School bus driver in fatal crash that killed six kids tests negative for drugs and alcohol Bus driver in crash that killed six kids tests negative for drugs THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Johnthony Walker arrested after a school bus from Woodmore Elementary in Chattanooga, Tennessee has overturned killing six children. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  43 AM \nCHATTANOOGA, Tenn. — A school bus driver had no drugs or alcohol in his system when he careened off a road and smashed into a tree, killing six elementary schoolchildren, police said Wednesday. \nChattanooga Police Sgt. Austin Garrett said a toxicology test was performed on Johnthony Walker, 24, the bus driver now in jail on five vehicular homicide charges. \nLater Wednesday, the police department said in a statement that a sixth child had died of injuries from the crash and another vehicular homicide charge would be added. \nFederal authorities said Walker left the designated bus route and had driven onto a curvy road while carrying 37 children on their way home from Woodmore Elementary School. \nSixth child in Chattanooga bus crash dies, police say \nPolice said he was driving well over the posted 30 mph limit when he lost control of the bus and slammed into a tree. Five children remain in the hospital. \nNational Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher A. Hart says it's unclear why driver Walker left the designated route and drove the bus down Talley Road. \n\"One of the things we're exploring is A, has he done it before, and B, if so, why?\" Hart said. \nHe said Walker, who has no criminal record in the state, had taken on a second job at an Amazon Fulfillment Center, and part of the agency's investigation will look at whether fatigue played a role in the wreck. \nDriver in Tenn. school bus crash involved in crash 2 months ago \nThe NTSB will also bring in a specialist to analyze video and audio recordings from the bus's interior cameras that were damaged in Monday's wreck. \nPolice disputed one woman's claim that the driver asked the children if they were \"prepared to die\" just before the wreck. Jasmine Mateen, whose 6-year-old daughter was among the dead, said one of her two surviving children who were on the bus told her about the driver's remarks. \nGarrett, however, said at a Wednesday press conference: \"I want to be very clear on this. No witness we have spoken with has that information or provided it directly to our investigators.\" \nHe added that investigators have not yet interviewed the children on the bus and asked anyone with additional information to bring it to police. \nFamilies identify four girls and boy killed in Tenn. bus crash \nThree of the children killed were in fourth grade, one in first grade and another in kindergarten, said Kirk Kelly, interim superintendent of Hamilton County schools. The age and identity of the sixth child wasn't immediately released. A makeshift memorial to them grew up around a telephone pole, with stuffed bears, flowers and dozens of balloons. \nTheir families remembered them as fun, happy children taken much too soon. A school bus from Woodmore Elementary in Chattanooga, Tennessee has overturned. (Chattanooga Fire Department) \nD'Myunn Brown liked to play little tricks on grown-ups. The 6-year-old would snatch a cellphone, hide it, then giggle and bat his big brown eyes. \n\"That's what made him so pretty, and he was as sweet as he could be,\" said his great-grandmother, Winifred Bray. \"I'm still numb. I still can't believe he's gone.\" \nLaFrederick Thirkill remembered his 9-year-old cousin, Cordayja Jones, as a girly-girl who liked dressing up and giving hugs. \nThirkill is the principal at Orchard Knob Elementary, where Cordayja attended before changing schools to Woodmore Elementary. \nShe was a polite little girl, he said. Even though he was her cousin, she called him \"Mr. Thirkill\" when she saw him in the hallways. \n\"I remember her as just a kid who always smiles,\" he said. \nSchool officials repeatedly declined to answer questions Wednesday about whether they received complaints about the driver. School Principal Brenda Adamson-Cothran said their focus is on \"giving our families and students the support that they need in this tragedy.\" \nWalker was involved in another bus accident only two months ago, police said. In September, he was driving the bus into a blind curve when he crossed over the center line and hit an SUV, according to a police report. No one was injured, and the damage to both vehicles was minor. He was not cited for any violations. \nHamilton County School District spokeswoman Amy Katcher referred all questions about his performance and that of other drivers to the company that manages them, Durham School Services. \nThe bus company did not respond to questions about its safety record or Walker's employment history. Durham CEO David A. Duke released a video statement expressing condolences to the families and pledging to work with investigators. \nA mother and 8-year-old son, who was injured in the crash, filed a lawsuit against Durham on Wednesday, attorney Herbert Thornbury confirmed. He said the boy suffered minor injuries, watched his best friend die and has been crying uncontrollably ever since. The lawsuit contends the boy may be permanently injured, sustained pain and suffering and will incur medical and other expenses as a result of the wreck. \nBased in Warrenville, Illinois, Durham operates about 13,700 vehicles across the U.S. and has nearly as many drivers, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. \nThe company has had 346 crashes over two years, including three resulting in deaths and 142 with injuries, federal figures show. During that period, it had 53 incidents involving unsafe driving violations. Join the Conversation:",

Voices It’s impossible for the government not to screw up Brexit with only 24 months to seal the deal \nFrom figuring out the negotiations guidelines to drawing up a transition deal, parliament’s vote, European Court of Justice reviews and even talks about who gets what wine from the Commission’s cellar, drawing up a Brexit deal will take years not months Wednesday 23 November 2016 11:55 BST Click to followThe Independent Online As the deadline approaches, an extension is not likely for Theresa May Getty \nIt has become conventional wisdom to assume that the EU will exact a price from Britain for leaving the EU; that some European countries are out to punish the UK, and that all they need to do is wait and a desperate Britain will strike a bad deal. Similarly, there is little to suggest that the UK will view the negotiations as anything but an adversarial, zero-sum affair. \nBut even if we assume the negotiations will be calm, cool and collected, and that politicking takes a backseat, the time challenge presented by Article 50 is enormous. When Article 50 is activated by Theresa May, Britain will get 24 months to conclude a decent divorce agreement with the rest of Europe. If a deal cannot be reached within that time, Brexit will be direct, dramatic and disorderly. \nMay’s notification will sound the opening bell for a flurry of discussions. But at least initially, these will not involve London. The EU’s 27 other member-states will first have to agree on the negotiating guidelines for the Commission, and aligning different interests will take time. Britain has refused to ‘show its hand’ and Europe has avoided pre-negotiations. So, since the referendum, the leaders of the 27 have only met twice to discuss Brexit , with the next meeting scheduled for February in Malta. Expect a few more meetings and delays before the EU’s guidelines are agreed. \nWhen the chief negotiators on both sides – Michel Barnier and David Davis – finally meet, their first order of business will be talks about the talks. They must agree on crucial procedural issues including whether to negotiate the withdrawal agreement and a future trade deal in parallel or one after the other, and how to negotiate a transitional agreement to avoid a ‘cliff-edge’ while finalising a comprehensive trade deal after Britain has formally left the EU. The transitional agreement is likely to grant the British more access to the EU’s single market than the final trade deal, and could be very cumbersome to agree. EU’s position in Brexit negotiations 'does not make sense' \nLess high-brow but no less important, Barnier and Davis will need to settle issues like how often to meet, where to meet, who can be present at the meetings, and even perhaps, what language to use . \nTowards the end of the divorce talks, more time will be lost. Article 50 says that a withdrawal agreement has to enter into force within 24 months. That means any parliamentary consent, including from the European Parliament, must be given before the two years are up. The British parliament will vote on the final agreement – and that could take up to six weeks – but so might others. \nSince the rights of EU workers in the UK will be a key feature in the divorce, Central European parliaments might seek a proper debate before their governments sign off on any deal. \nNeither should we dismiss the possibility that the European Court of Justice will be asked to give its views on the legality of the divorce terms. In 1991 the Court unpicked some elements of the new European Economic Area – even after all countries involved had agreed to its design – causing a year long delay. \nAs for the meat of the Article 50 talks, it is not just about who pays the pensions of British EU civil servants. Article 50 covers many delicate areas including the UK’s new schedule of WTO commitments and British access to European counter-terrorism databases. What experts have said about Brexit What experts have said about Brexit 1/11 Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond \nThe Chancellor claims London can still be a world financial hub despite Brexit “One of Britain’s great strengths is the ability to offer and aggregate all of the services the global financial services industry needs” “This has not changed as a result of the EU referendum and I will do everything I can to ensure the City of London retains its position as the world’s leading international financial centre.” Reuters 2/11 Yanis Varoufakis \nGreece's former finance minister compared the UK relations with the EU bloc with a well-known song by the Eagles: “You can check out any time you like, as the Hotel California song says, but you can't really leave.

We are fully supportive of a process that is as little disruptive as possible so that people around the world can continue to benefit from economic growth\" Getty Images 11/11 Kristin Forbes \nAmerican economist and an external member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England argues that the economy had been “less stormy than many expected” following the shock referendum result: “For now…the economy is experiencing some chop, but no tsunami. The adverse winds could quickly pick up – and merit a stronger policy response. But recently they have shifted to a more favourable direction” Getty \nBut if anything Article 50 has all the ingredients to become a fight about money. Here are some of the thorny issues that need resolving: Britain must be untangled from the European Investment Bank, and its 16 per cent share of the bank’s capital – nearly 40 billion euros – must be returned. EU grants will need to be repaid and fishing quotas adjusted. Someone will have to pay for relocating the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority from London. In turn, the UK will claim its share of EU assets – from EU offices down to the Commission’s wine cellar and cutlery . Lawyers on both sides will have a field day. \nAs the deadline approaches, an extension is not likely. Europeans will elect a new European Parliament in Spring 2019, a new Commission will take office later that year, and a new multiannual budget will start in 2020. The 27 will want to get Brexit out of the way before a new institutional cycle starts. \nSo the negotiating horizon will be much, much shorter than 24 months – perhaps 18 months or less – and the issues to be resolved are deeply divisive. And this assumes two big ifs: that no event in the next two years will throw the talks off course and that the political climate is favourable. \nThe UK and EU can hardly be faulted for being meticulous in the negotiations. This is what voters, parliaments and the courts expect. But the time constraints mean that the perfect will be the enemy of the good. Crashing out of the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be the hardest Brexit imaginable. Inside the Article 50 pressure cooker, someone will have to carry a watch. \nRem Korteweg is a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform More about: ",

    "text": "Fans in Saskatchewan will remember the 1987 and 1997 telethons that helped save the team when it was twice in danger of going out of business.\n\"Good evening, Rider telethon here, how many seats can we put you down for?\"\n\"Yeah, thanks ... put me down for four and I'd like to challenge everyone in North Battleford to match that ...\"\n\"OK, bud, that's great.\"\nIt worked.\nCBC Throwback Thursday: Saving the Roughriders 2:06\nSomehow this solution doesn't seem workable for Toronto, especially since the results might be embarrassing.\nBut there is a spark there of what needs to be done to fix the perennially struggling Argonauts, and restore some dignity to the sport around these parts.\nIt may be simpler than everyone is making out.\nRocket Men: The far-out (but true) story of the '91 Argos Perhaps it's time for some of those fans who watch the game in the comfort of their home (and there are a couple hundred thousand of you at least) to get off your bums and get down to watch the games if you care even a cow's lick about football. (This does not include those dedicated football fans who have been making the trip regularly for years. You are true and loyal and deserving of respect.)\nThis is a new and soul-shaking approach for me, as since 1968 I have never put any fault on the fans through the insanity that often revolves around this city's gridiron. Years ago, I was a season subscriber for almost a decade — so I know, Double Blue folk, I know.\nBoutique sport The new paradigm hit me while reading stories about ticket sales for Sunday's Grey Cup, perhaps the last to be held around these parts for a long while. Twitter announced with some excitement on Wednesday afternoon \"less than 2,000 tickets\" remained for the game at BMO Field.\nWonderful.\nFree ducats (remember when they were priced out of the ballpark up until a month ago ?) are being handed out to employees of TSN, and rumours of \"papering\" the house are rampant. This has happened at many previous Cups, especially here and in Vancouver, but it's never been done for a stadium with only 35,000 seats.\nToronto Grey Cup tickets prices slashed Here's the deal — Toronto is not, and has not been for around 25 years, a football town.\nWhy is complicated, but it includes a stupidly shortsighted local TV blackout rule in the 1970s and 1980s that sent an entire generation of Toronto fans to the NFL, plus endless poor ownership decisions and a growing feeling among locals that our game was second class.\nBack in 1976, one season before Major League Baseball came to the shores of Lake Ontario, the Argos drew an average of 47,354 fans, with a high of 50,212. In 1981, the average was 33,175 per, with a high of 38,225. It was downhill from there.\nCFL football in Toronto, once second only to the Leafs here, has become a boutique sport, loved by a small, though enthusiastic, group of supporters — almost entirely on television.\nYou're not cool — but that's OK Young Toronto fans are going to the pro parks and arena in greater numbers these days to see the Blue Jays, Raptors and Toronto FC, and certainly the Argo managers need to find a way to get some whippersnappers of their own.\nFootball fans can help in a big way by stopping the excuses and getting involved.\nThere are none that resonate anymore.\nYou can't complain about the stadium being lousy. Yes, Rogers Centre was terrible for football when it was half full, but BMO Field is an absolute gem. You should see it. Few of you have.\nArgo games more fan-friendly but still lacking You can't complain it's hard to get to when Toronto FC fans (an average of 26,583 this year) don't see it as a problem. They show up, even when there was construction all around this summer, and the Go Train was delayed because of the heat, and the Bathurst streetcar had turned into hot buses, and parking was a problem.\nYou can't whine about the team being lousy. Yes, the Argos went 5-13 this year, but they were 10-8 in 2015. They won the Grey Cup in 2012. That's not a long time ago.\nAlso, week one this year drew 24,812 at BMO Field to see Toronto lose. Three weeks later, only 12,373 came by when the club was 2-1. What, the great new stadium and a winning record were too confusing?\nStop complaining the team isn't \"cool\". Neither are you. You're a CFL football fan in a town where that's equivalent to being the guy who wears an ugly Christmas sweater in February. The Raptors are cool. Toronto FC is cool. The Blue Jays are cool, but they weren't until the 2015 trade deadline. Things change in a hurry.\nDon't tell everyone you're waiting for the NFL. The National Football League is not coming. Evah. It's going to London, or St. Louis again, or anywhere but here after the \"Bills in Toronto\" disaster.\nFinally, don't use the excuse there's no atmosphere at the games because \"nobody goes.\" Yeah, like you. How about sucking it up, taking a page from Toronto FC fans, and starting a supporter's club for the south end zone? Make noise. Have fun.\nGet away from your TV. Put some effort in.",

As they do, the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America.” Also Read: Fidel Castro Death: 9 Hollywood Stars Seduced by Cuban Leader \nTrump, meanwhile, took a different approach. \n“Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades,” Trump said. “Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.” \n“While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,” he said. \nCastro died on Friday night at age 90. He was president of Cuba from 1976 to 2008, when he stepped down to allow his brother to take power. He was previously prime minister from the Communist revolution in 1959 to 1976. \nPresident Obama ended five decades of frozen U.S.-Cuba relations two years ago, reestablishing diplomatic relations with the Communist island. A 56-year economic embargo that has crippled Cuba financially remains in place. \nRead both Trump and Obama’s statements in their entirety below.

REUTERS/Vincent Kessler \nLONDON The European Parliament's top Brexit negotiator backed the idea of individual European Union memberships for Britons who want to stay in the bloc in an interview published on Saturday. \nFormer Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, a European federalist and arch-foe of eurosceptics said there were legal obstacles - but in principle he supported individual EU memberships for Britons, paid by annual fee. \n\"Many say 'we don't want to cut our links'. I like the idea that people who are European citizens and saying they want to keep it have the possibility of doing so,\" he told the Times. \nAndrew Bridgen, a pro-Brexit British member of parliament, said Verhofstadt's comments were designed to divide Britons and undermine June's vote to leave the EU. \n\"The truth is that Brussels will try every trick in the book to stop us leaving,\" he told the Times. \nThe European Parliament will have a limited role in the detailed negotiations with British Prime Minister Theresa May, once she formally launches the process triggered by the June 23 referendum vote to leave the bloc. \nBut members of European Parliament will have to pass legislation to enact a divorce, and possibly other agreements. \nEarlier this week, Verhofstadt said the European Parliament would not accept an agreement for Britain's exit from the European Union that would endanger any of the four EU freedoms, including the freedom of movement of people. \n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by Alexander Smith) Next In UK",

EMMA DANGERFIELD/FAIRFAX NZ \nCanterbury District Health Board chief executive David Meates says clinicians are worried it will be more difficult to ensure clinical safety while mental health services remain at Princess Margaret Hospital. \nA child and youth inpatient unit, eating disorders unit, mothers and babies mental health service and regional community mental health teams remain at PMH after other services moved as part of the Christchurch hospitals redevelopment. \nPlans to move mental health services from PMH have been left in bureaucratic limbo. The CDHB will have to come up with at least $30 million to relocate the services, the emails show. \nREAD MORE: * Government to fund several mental health packages worth millions for Canterbury JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nDavid Meates, chief exective of Christchurch District Health Board, left, Jonathan Coleman, Minister of Health, Bryan Spinks, Burwood Hospital project director, and Michael Hundleby, acting national director, during a visit to Burwood Hospital. \nAn original business case for the hospitals redevelopment prepared by the CDHB in 2012 included the relocation of PMH-based mental health services to the Christchurch Hospital Parkside building. \nIn February, Meates told director general of mental health John Crawshaw the final business case submitted to Cabinet had cut the planned move without the CDHB's knowledge. \n\"These services are now stranded at PMH site and will require additional operational resources to maintain them on what will be an empty site. Concerns are being raised by the clinicians as it will be more difficult to ensure clinical safety,\" Meates wrote. \nAbout 31 patients from three specialist mental health services and staff remain at the earthquake-damaged facility. Ad Feedback \nCritical structural weaknesses were identified in the hospital buildings after the 2011 earthquake, and engineers recommended making seismic upgrades. The decision was made to keep services at the facility only until they could be moved. \nMinistry of Health projects director Michael Hundleby said in a statement to Stuff the original plan was \"not being progressed … as there is not the space to accommodate [the services]\" at Christchurch Hospital. \nThe emails show Meates raised the issue of relocation multiple times, often highlighting the urgency of the situation. \n\"There is a real urgency required to review options, models of care and potential funding options,\" he wrote to Hundleby in July. \nIn December 2015, the ministry's capital investment committee chairman, Evan Davies, told CDHB chairman Murray Cleverley​ in a letter that a \"two-step\" business case would need to be developed by the CDHB as the project would cost over $15m. \nDavies' letter made it clear the cost would be born by the health board. \n\"There is no Crown funding, so it will need to come from CDHB's baseline resources or the Earthquake Repairs Programme of Works,\" he wrote. \nAn independent \"clinical review of the proposed models of care and options\" for the services was requested. \nIn another letter to Crawshaw, Meates said a wide range of temporary and permanent options costing \"from $30m upwards\" had been explored, including using Burwood and Christchurch hospitals, the temporary police station or various locations at Hillmorton Hospital. \nIt would take 12 to 18 months to approve any of the options, with a longer timeline needed for temporary service arrangements in the interim, he said. \n\"Any requirement to retain these services on the remaining PMH facility needs to consider that the facility contains significant critical structural weaknesses and fragile infrastructure including sewage and water.\" \nMeates said minimum repairs were made to PMH over the past four years, \"under the clear basis that the facility was to be vacated as planned in the [original] detailed business case\". \nA CDHB business case sent to the Hospital Redevelopment Partnership Group (HRPG) in March was \"not formally considered … as a source of funds had not been identified\", Hundleby told Meates. \nNurses working at the affected services were not happy about working at PMH due to the lack of supportive infrastructure. \n\"We want to see a solution but there doesn't seem to be one in sight,\" New Zealand Nurses Organisation organiser Lynda Boyd said. \nCleverley said he was not on the board when the original business case was drafted and submitted. \nHe said work was being done on a business case for the relocation of those services, and all the options would be considered once that was completed. \nMeates declined to speak to Stuff about the situation. - Stuff",

    "text": " Google+\nElise Amendola/Associated Press\nThe main entrance of Massachusetts General Hospital.\nBy Liz Kowalczyk Globe Staff November 27, 2016\nFederal regulators have faulted three large Massachusetts hospitals, along with a dozen others nationwide, for failing to properly report patient deaths and injuries that may have been caused by medical devices — part of a renewed effort to detect problems before they cause widespread harm.\nMassachusetts General, Brigham and Women’s, and UMass Memorial were among 17 hospitals inspected last December by the FDA. Regulators were concerned about infections possibly linked to contaminated instruments called duodenoscopes, used to examine the small intestine, and about the spread of uterine cancer when a surgical device called a power morcellator, which cuts up tissue, is used.\nAdvertisement\nLast month, the agency disclosed the inspection reports, showing that 15 of the 17 medical centers were either late in reporting cases in which patients were harmed by various devices or failed to report at all. The FDA inspection reports also disclosed other lapses.\nDr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA’s center for devices and radiological health, said in an Oct. 24 blog post on the agency’s website that the problems identified at these hospitals are hardly unique and, in fact, are widespread.\nThe Food and Drug Administration, device makers, and hospitals have been criticized for failing to act quickly when it appears a device may cause a threat. The FDA depends on hospitals to help identify new safety problems with devices and to report upswings in previously recognized problems.\nView Story Right procedure, wrong patient There are at least 14 instances since 2011 in which caregivers at Mass. facilities have performed a procedure on the wrong patient.\nA list of mistaken medical procedures\nAgency inspectors found that Mass. General failed to report the deaths of two patients, one of whom suffered a heart attack in the emergency department. The FDA withheld certain details from the reports, including descriptions of the devices involved — though Mass. General executives said the agency examined cases involving duodenoscopes as well as other devices.\nMass. General executives said a monitor was involved in the emergency department patient’s death, but said they could not provide more information because of patient privacy concerns. The FDA said the hospital also failed to report a patient injury and was late in reporting the deaths of two surgery patients and an injury to another patient.\nAdvertisement\nDr. Elizabeth Mort, senior vice president of quality and safety, said Mass. General has a strong history of bringing forward device problems, but the FDA “is widening the net’’ of incidents that hospitals must report to the agency, manufacturers, or both. The FDA “may be able to draw conclusions that one institution cannot draw,’’ she said.\nHospitals are required to report within 10 days information that “reasonably suggests that a medical device has or may have caused or contributed to’’ a serious injury or death of a patient.\nOver the two-year period the FDA examined, Mass. General submitted seven mandatory reports, plus 72 voluntary reports about concerns with devices that did not involve patient harm, Mort said.\nIn cases cited by the agency, the hospital did not report them because “we didn’t necessarily think the device caused the problem,’’ Mort said. For example, a monitor did not detect that the patient had a pacemaker but it was not designed to do so, Mort said.\n“They want us to report problems even when the device worked perfectly,’’ she said. “They are ramping up surveillance. If the design could be improved, the FDA wants to know about it.’’\nThe January report from the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions listed Mass. General as one of the hospitals with patient infections tied to contaminated duodenoscopes, which is apparently why the FDA inspected the hospital.\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff\nThe Worcester campus of UMass Memorial Medical Center.\nMort said that in late 2014 and early 2015, Mass. General reported concerns about the device to the manufacturer and stopped using it. But in the end, extensive testing by the hospital was unable to tie patient infections to the instruments, despite the report’s initial conclusion.\nThe FDA faulted the Brigham for failing to report the death of one patient and for submitting four reports on patient injuries late. The patient, who died in December 2013, had undergone a procedure 18 months earlier with a power morcellator, often used during hysterectomies to shred tissue and extract it through small incisions.\nThe risk of morcellation was brought to public attention by Dr. Amy Reed. Soon after undergoing a hysterectomy at the Brigham in October 2013, follow-up tests on the removed tissue showed that she had an aggressive cancer, and that the cancerous tissue had been spread throughout her abdominal cavity during the surgery, sparking advanced cancer. She and her husband, Dr. Hooman Noorchashm, have fought an aggressive battle against morcellation and the hospital.\nBrigham spokeswoman Erin McDonough said the hospital contacted the FDA by phone in March 2014 about the patient’s death and Reed’s case but did not believe they met the criteria for mandatory reporting.\n“The device functioned as expected and was used in the way it was intended, although with unintended and tragic consequences,’’ she said in an e-mail. The FDA later issued a clarification, saying that such cases should be reported, and discouraged the use of morcellators through a safety advisory.\nThe four reports regarding injuries involved cardiac patients, McDonough said. But she said one case did not need to be reported and a second had misstated the date of the incident and was actually filed on time.\nThe FDA findings at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester included failure to report infections in patients who had undergone a procedure with a duodenoscope. Three of those patients later died, but two of the patients had complicated illnesses, the FDA report said.\nTimothy Tai for The Boston Globe\nDr. Dominic Nompleggi, chief of gastroenterology at UMass Memorial, said 14 patients developed infections. But he said the hospital was never able to find the same bacteria on the scopes, and therefore could not definitively link them to the infections. He said UMass Memorial reported the cases to Massachusetts public health officials but did not believe it also had to tell the FDA.\nHospitals use hundreds of medical devices, including imaging machines, heart testing devices, and in-vitro tests to make diagnoses; infusion pumps, ventilators, and robotics to provide treatment; and an array of implants to replace diseased joints and organs.\nChris Lavanchy, engineering director in the health devices division of ECRI Institute, a Pennsylvania-based patient safety organization, said over-reporting of incidents is also a problem. Hospitals report numerous cases in which it’s unclear if the device was related to the patient injury, making it hard for the FDA to untangle problems. Investigations become even more challenging when the injury involves the spread of cancer or infection, which can occur days or even years after the procedure.\nThe FDA did not take further action against the hospitals because it said they were all trying to improve reporting practices.\nSpokeswoman Deborah Kotz said the agency recognizes “it may not be immediately apparent to health care providers that a patient’s exposure to a device may have caused or contributed to that patient’s death.’’\n“Nevertheless, the FDA considers hospital reporting of device-related patient deaths and serious injuries to be critical to improving the safety of medical devices and improving patient care overall,’’ she said in an e-mail.\nLiz Kowalczyk can be reached at kowalczyk@globe.com .",

By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: November 28, 2016 12:20 PM The authority has ordered 86 of six coach trains from Korea’s manufacturer. The new trains will be seen on two routes. (Reuters) \nDelhi Metro riders are up for a treat as DMRC is all set to unveil its brand new, more efficient and faster metro trains in the coming year. These trains will be opened for commuters in March. The authority has ordered 86 of six coach trains from Korea’s manufacturer. The new trains will be seen on two routes. The first one being Magenta Line and the other being the Pink Line. While the former (Magenta line) connects Botanical Garden and Janakpuri West, the later (Pink Line) connects Mukundpur and Shiv Vihar. However, according to DMRC, it would not be possible to integrate the trains with the existing ones. These are state-of-the-art trains and are driverless. Aside from this, the trains will have several other new features. Check them all out: \n1. Driver-less trains \nThe trains have a mode which enables them to run unattended. The mode however would be run by an operator initially – the mode would be put under trail for an year or so but eventually, the trains will go completely unattended. \n2. More spacious \nThe coaches in the new Korean trains are wider than the existing ones and the technical equipments too have been moved under the seat increasing the carrying capacity of the train from 1780 to 1866 per train, according to a report in HT. \n3. Faster \nThe new trains will be 10% faster than the existing ones. Moreover, since the distance between two trains can be less, the trains would be able to run at the frequency of 90 seconds as against the current frequency of two minutes and 10 seconds. \n4. Digital Screens \nAll the coaches in the new trains will have a fully programmable LCD screens which can be used for playing advertisements and flashing route maps. \n5. Energy Efficient \nThe new design will lower the energy consumption by 20% with the help of the new technologies such as LED saloon lights, automatic dimming facility based on ambient light and energy efficient air conditioning system controlled by inverter. \n6. In addition to this, the metros will have coloured seats, wifi connectivity, USB ports and backrest support for wheelchair users.  ",

    "text": "Wealthy seen snaring a $21 billion gift with Trump tax overhaul Bloomberg 5 hrs ago Simone Foxman NEW YORK — Some of the wealthiest families in the U.S. are hoping for a $21 billion benefit from President-elect Donald Trump next year.\nThey and their businesses are re-evaluating, or putting on hold, strategies for transferring money to heirs as the new administration could work with a cooperative Congress to reform or repeal federal estate and gift taxes among its early moves. That would be an about-face from President Barack Obama, who sought to place tighter restrictions on the way wealth could be passed from generation to generation.\n“Eliminating the death tax will equate to an enormous gift,” said Peter Rup, who manages about $900 million for rich families at Artemis Wealth Advisors in New York. The IRS collected $21 billion from taxes on estates and gifts in its fiscal year 2016, according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department.\nTrump is gearing up to embark on the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades. His proposals include cutting income and corporate taxes and eliminating the so-called death tax, which is paid primarily by the richest 10 percent of earners, according to the Tax Policy Center. Advisers to wealthy families and their offices also anticipate that the new administration’s approach to estate and gift taxes could negate rules they were bracing for, which sought to limit tax breaks on transferring wealth.\nWealthy families sometimes use a discount strategy to pass on shares in their privately owned businesses and family offices — that is, firms that handle the financial affairs of a single family and are often structured as partnerships or limited liability companies. Families often took a discount of 20 percent to 45 percent on the value of the stakes to save on taxes, according to a report by law firm White & Case LLP. The Obama administration tried for years to curtail the benefit through legislation without success and instead in August proposed rules through the Internal Revenue Service set to do just that.\nThe proposed change was met by objections not only from some of the country’s wealthiest individuals but also from trade organizations like the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association and the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Both organizations have many members who own family businesses.\nFamily enterprises of all kinds are now optimistic that the new administration will halt the IRS effort. Under the new president, any such rules “could be pulled,” said John Olivieri, a White & Case lawyer who works with wealthy families.\nUnder current law an individual can leave up to $5.45 million to heirs without paying federal gift or estate tax. Above that threshold, the tax is assessed at a 40 percent rate. Married couples can shield estates worth as much as $10.9 million from the tax this year.\nTrump’s tax changes already appear to be on the fast track. A week after the election, Vice President-elect Mike Pence told House Republicans to be ready to move on sweeping legislation next year and mentioned taxes among the items. On Nov. 15, Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who chairs the House tax-writing panel said discussions were already in the works.\nGiven the prospect for sweeping tax reform, wealth advisers are telling clients to hold off on making large wealth transfers until there’s more clarity about the rules. They’re also advising them to take steps before year-end to defray taxes by, for example, booking investment losses now.\n“More than ever, any income, including investment income, that can be deferred to 2017 should be,” Nicholas Bertha, director of wealth and trust planning at Fieldpoint Private, wrote in a client advisory after the election. “Discretionary deductions, on the other hand, should be accelerated to this year.”\nTrump’s plan would replace the estate tax with a capital gains tax on the appreciation of inherited assets of more than $10 million, subject to some exemptions for small businesses and family farms.\nHe may face a difficult time ushering in a permanent end to the estate and gift taxes, even with Congress on his side. Under current rules, a permanent repeal would require 60 senators to agree. In 2017, Republicans will hold a thin majority of only 51 or 52 seats, depending on the outcome of Louisiana’s runoff election on Dec. 10.\nIn the meantime, advisers to high-net worth families on their trust and estate plans are re-evaluating.\n“Estate planning and gifting strategies will still be extremely important,” said Ida Liu, managing director and global market manager to the metro New York region for Citi Private Bank. “But certain types of trusts may be more or less favorable going forward if the estate tax is repealed or restructured.”\nGo to MSN Home",

When the pressure is weak it can split in two with the second pocket of cold air being pushed southwards.",

Photo by Robert Cohen, Forest Park Parkway near Kingshighway to close Dec. 5 for up to a year Buy Now Robert Cohen \nTraffic passes underneath Kingshighway Boulevard on Forest Park Parkway as seen looking west from the pedestrian bridge on the Barnes-Jewish Hospital campus on Friday, June 17, 2016. Sections of the parkway will close next month for a year so that the road can be raised to the level of Kingshighway, making it easier to navigate the area. Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com \nA chunk of Forest Park Parkway west of Kingshighway is set to close Dec. 5 for up to a year as part of a $10 million project to create a \"traditional intersection\" between the two thoroughfares, according to Barnes-Jewish Hospital. \nForest Park Parkway, which currently runs underneath Kingshighway Boulevard near the BJC Healthcare campus, will be raised to connect and be at-grade with Kingshighway. \nLocal traffic west of the construction won't be affected and Kingshighway will be open in both directions. The existing Kingshighway bridge over Forest Park Parkway will be left in place and filled underneath, the hospital said. \nThe project had been set to start in July, but was delayed. The city said about 17,000 drivers use that stretch of Forest Park Parkway a day. \nForest Park Parkway currently runs under Kingshighway, which can make it difficult for drivers to get to Barnes-Jewish Hospital, as well as to the Central West End and Forest Park, the hospital said. \nThose headed east on Forest Park can't turn onto northbound Kingshighway. Drivers on Kingshighway can't get to westbound Forest Park Parkway from either direction. \nConstruction is to be done overnight, between 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. Kingshighway will be open during the day, but some lane closures are expected overnight. Forest Park Parkway between Kingshighway and Euclid Avenue will be limited to just one lane in each direction. \nAnd of course, it will mean detours for those who use Forest Park Parkway to travel through the area. \n\"That's my east-west link,\" said Joe Gallo of University City. He said he'll rely more on Highway 40 (Interstate 64), which he's not keen to do. \nIt's hoped the project will make the intersection of Forest Park and Euclid, where many pedestrians cross, safer as well. Now, faster eastbound traffic coming from beneath Kingshighway mixes there with slower eastbound vehicles. \nThe Barnes-Jewish north expansion is set to open in August, which the hospital says will substantially increase the number of patients comng to the north end of the campus. The new intersection should be safer for pedestrians and reduce the crisscrossing of vehicles on Forest Park Parkway near Euclid. \nFunding for the project is funded comes from a $2.5 million federal grant for work on the Forest Park Parkway bridge over the MetroLink tracks west of Kingshighway, as well as $5 million from BJC and $2.5 million from Washington University School of Medicine. \nLeah Thorsen • 314-340-8320",

    "text": "Follow us Bring back the bush! Why you should stop waxing your pubic hair and start having amazing sex Miranda Kane Monday 28 Nov 2016 7:00 am The bush basically trims itself (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nFull disclosure: I’m a Powermuff girl. \nMy bush is a full, Amazonian chaparral. \nIt is a coppice of mystery and wonder. \nMy pubis lies untouched by wax and razor and only the fairest may enter my dingly-dell. \nI, ladies and gentlemen, do not shave my pubes. What’s more, I wholeheartedly and thoroughly recommend it. \nCertainly, the occasional trim might be in order, but is there really a need to go ripping out your whole hinterland? Not in my experience. \nMany moons ago, I did try. \nI went through six months of waxing and completely clearing my under-thicket. No strips, no Brazilians, just go bare or go home. \nBear in mind that, as a sex-worker, I would have had several more tourists to my national park than the average garden. \nDo you know how many people noticed it? \nCan you give me a rough estimate of how many men said ‘Golly gosh, I appreciate such a smooth pasture?’ \nNone. Zero. Nada. Absolutely no-one. (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nIn fact, I got complaints. They had come to frolic in my Yosemite, and all they got was a rather dull rock-garden. \nI can’t say I wasn’t relieved. I’d been through my fair share of razor rashes, ingrown hairs and weeks of squirming on the seat of a Tube train in order to scratch it just right as the hairs grew back. \nIt was a constant inconvenience and discomfort and it was boring. \nThe whole process of doing it was boring. The sex was boring. The regrowth was boring. \nThe only highlight was when, during a wax, I got accidentally fingered by the beautician. \nAlthough that then led to some severe thrush after the stray dollop of moisturiser sent my ph balance into a tailspin. \nSo why has this torture been inflicted on us? And by ‘us’, I don’t mean just women – although we do bear the brunt of it. \nMen are feeling the need to go at their gonads too, but I can see why – the myth that ‘It’ll make my junk look bigger’. \nYes, because we’re into you just for your peen. (Picture: Liberty Antonia Sadler for Metro.co.uk) \nThat’s why we have taken up so much time on the internet saying how much we luuuurve dick pics. \nNo. Stop that. \nAlthough at a family gathering, an in-law cried out that he would be disgusted if a girl didn’t shave her pubes off. \nI asked him how he could tell and he just said, ‘Well, on a date, I ask ‘em. Are you shaved or what, love?’ \nThis is a man who also thinks albinos are some kind of camel – just so you know that’s the level we’re dealing with. \nA bit of genitalia topiary should be a preference, not expected. \nAnd it certainly shouldn’t be the basis or ’make-or-break’ of any relationship. \nIf your partner desperately needs a reason to let you be in charge of your own body hair, here’s a quick run down. Why you should have a full bush \n1. Pubic hair collects pheromones – those lovely little particles that announce ‘Hello! I’m ready for sex, please!’. And is it just me, or do they smell good anyway? That lovely, musky scent that helps you remember what you were up to last night. \n2. They’re protection from bacteria. Hairs draw up moisture and protect your genitalia from things like thrush, and removing it leaves tiny open wounds that increase your chances of abscesses and infections. \n3. They increase sensation. At the end of each follicle is a nerve ending, so when you gently brush or breath over them, it gives you a tiny tingle to help stimulation. \n4. They’re natural, they’re supposed to be there. It’s a major hint from nature that, like pretty much all the other nifty things in and around your body, they have a job to do. Whether that job is warmth, cushioning, or just being a filter for picking out people who want to degrade you by insisting they have a say in what you do with your body hair. \n5. If you’re in a sexual relationship with someone who says things like, ‘The only hair I like is the hair on your head,’ then you’re going out with a dickhead. Seriously. Do not let them touch you. Do not give them the pleasure of your beautiful genitalia. Grab your coat, leave, do not pass go and seriously consider charging them £200 for the pleasure of your company. \nI think it’s also pertinent to remember that the only reason why they’ve been eradicated from porn is probably just due to camera angles. \nOnce upon a time, a humble pornographer realised as they were trying to get the perfect money-shot among flailing limbs and sweaty buttocks that, if only those pesky pubes weren’t in the way, they would get a better view. \nFortunately, no one is thrusting a camera between your legs. Sorry. \nObviously, some people have no say in their pubic hair growth for various reasons, and I’m certainly not ridiculing the sight of a bald mons pubis – just the effort and expectation that goes into it. \nI’ve read far too many articles that say, ‘It defines you as being a ‘Real Woman,’ which is a phrase that needs to die in a fire. \nIt’s basically up to you. \nIf you find yourself picking up a razor before a hot date, then think about why. \nAre you cropping it off for yourself, or because someone else thinks it’s expected? Can you really be bothered? \nAll I’m saying is that, if you find yourself staring into the face of a person who doesn’t give two hoots about your razor rash, regrowth and gets albinos confused with alpacas then it’s time to put down the razor and love your muff.

    "text": " 19am EST Hundreds more Myanmar Rohingya flee to Bangladesh: aid workers By Mohammad Nurul Islam and Wa Lone \nCOX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh/YANGON Hundreds of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar crossed the border to Bangladesh over the weekend and on Monday, aid workers said, seeking shelter from escalating violence in the northwest that has killed at least 86 people and displaced some 30,000. \nAn official from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations' migration agency, who did not want to be identified, said he had witnessed more than 500 people enter its camps in the hills near the border on Monday. \nAid workers from other United Nations agencies and Reuters reporters in the IOM camps also reported seeing Rohingyas who said they had recently fled the fighting in Myanmar. The UN workers did not give specific numbers, but expressed concern about a sudden influx of people. \nThe bloodshed is the most serious since hundreds were killed in communal clashes in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine in 2012, and is posing the biggest test yet for the eight-month-old administration of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. \nSoldiers have poured into the area along Myanmar's frontier with Bangladesh, responding to coordinated attacks on three border posts on Oct. 9 that killed nine police officers. \nMoulavi Aziz Khan, 60, from a village in northern Rakhine, said he left Myanmar last week, after the military surrounded his home and set fire to it. \n\"At that time, I fled with my four daughters and three grandsons to a nearby hill ... later, we managed to cross the border,\" he said. \nMyanmar's military and the government have rejected allegations by residents and rights groups that soldiers have raped Rohingya women, burnt houses and killed civilians during the military operation in Rakhine. \nNew York-based Human Rights Watch said at the weekend satellite images taken on Nov. 10, 17 and 18 showed 820 destroyed buildings in five villages in northern Rakhine, bringing the total number it says it has documented to 1,250. \nCHECKING REPORTS \nMyanmar's government has also rejected previous reports of Rohingya civilians trying to escape to Bangladesh. \nZaw Htay, presidential spokesman and member of the newly-formed information taskforce on Rakhine, said the government continued to investigate such reports, but had not so far been able to substantiate any of them. \n\"We checked with the military and police about people fleeing to Bangladesh since Oct. 9. Some people fled from their villages, but we put them back to their villages,\" he said. \n\"If something like that happened, we are concerned and we will continue to investigate. We are not rejecting all allegations...our government always checks all the allegations, and some were found to be untrue.\" \nMyanmar's army has declared an \"operations zone\" in mainly Muslim northern Rakhine, where it says it is battling Islamist-inspired Rohingya insurgents, and it is not possible for international reporters to enter the area to verify claims. \nMyanmar's 1.1 million Rohingya, viewed as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh by many of the country's majority Buddhists, are denied citizenship and face severe restrictions on their travel. \nUp to 30,000 people are now estimated to be displaced and thousands more affected by the recent fighting, the UN has said. \nHumanitarian operations that had been providing food, cash, and nutrition to more than 150,000 people have been suspended for more than 40 days. \nThe UN refugee agency called on the Myanmar government for access to allow it to distribute aid. \n\"The idea is to help them where they are, so that they wouldn't be forced to cross over into Bangladesh,\" Vivian Tan, regional public information officer for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told Reuters Television. \n\"If they can't get the assistance where they are then, if they are forced to cross into another country like Bangladesh, we're really appealing to the Bangladeshi government to honor its long tradition of hospitality and open its borders to these refugees.\" \n(Additional reporting by Serajul Quadir in DHAKA and Juarawee Kittisilpa in BANGKOK; Editing by Alex Richardson) Next In World News",

    "text": "Jared Kushner Defends Donald Trump in First Media Interview By ALANA ABRAMSON Nov 22, 2016, 12:01 PM ET 0 Shares Star Jonathan Ernst/Reuters   greets his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, right, at his election night rally in New York City, Nov. 9, 2016. 0 Shares Email  's son-in-law Jared Kushner was viewed as one of the most influential voices during the campaign season, and is widely expected to retain that influence in the incoming administration. But with the exception of a July op-ed he wrote in the The New York Observer, a paper he owns, Kushner, the husband of Trump's daughter Ivanka, has remained mostly on the sidelines in public. He recently gave an interview to Forbes magazine, describing his role in the campaign and defending both his father-in-law and members of the administration who have garnered controversy. Here are some things we learned about Kushner from this interview. DEFENDS TRUMP AND STEVE BANNON AGAINST ALLEGATIONS OF RACISM AND ANTI-SEMITISM Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, has been the subject of fascination, particularly in the Jewish community, because his heritage appears to be directly at odds with core tenets of Trump's campaign. As Kushner describes in an op-ed he wrote this past summer, he is the grandson of Holocaust survivors who subsequently came to the United States. Trump has repeatedly advocated to halt refugees -- individuals who are arguably in similar positions to Kushner's grandparents 70 years ago -- from entering the country. He has also made derogatory comments about Mexican immigrants. In the Forbes interview, however, Kushner insists his father-in-law will not stand for intolerance. “I just know a lot of the things that people try to attack him with are just not true or overblown or exaggerations. I know his character. I know who he is, and I obviously would not have supported him if I thought otherwise. If the country gives him a chance, they’ll find he won’t tolerate hateful rhetoric or behavior,” he said. “You can’t not be an anti-Semite for 69 years and all of a sudden become an anti-Semite because you’re running,” Kushner notes, according to Forbes. Forbes also asked about the way Trump's election appeared to embolden the KKK and the \"alt-right,\" both of whom are notoriously anti-Semitic. Kushner responded that Trump has repeatedly denounced these groups. \"I don’t know if he could ever denounce them enough for some people,\" he said. Part of the reason the alt-right feels energized is the appointment of Steve Bannon as Trump's chief strategist. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, which has been described as a prominent platform for the alt-right, left the site to join Trump's campaign. \"All I know about Steve is my experience working with him. He’s an incredible Zionist and loves Israel,\" Kushner told Forbes. FUTURE ROLE IN A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION It is presumed that Kushner will be continue to be an influential adviser to Trump, whether or not he assumes an official role. As ABC News reported , if Kushner served in the Trump administration, it could violate the nation's Nepotism law, which states that \"a public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official.\" Kushner did not divulge specifics on a role he would play, but told Forbes people are \"asking him to get involved in a more official capacity.\" “There’s a lot of people who have been asking me to get involved in a more official capacity. I just have to think about what that means for my family, for my business and make sure it’d be the right thing for a multitude of reasons,\" he told the magazine. DENIES ANY INVOLVEMENT IN OUSTING CHRISTIE FROM TRANSITION TEAM When New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was officially removed as chair of the Trump transition team, there was speculation that Kushner was instrumental in the shakeup. As New Jersey attorney general, Christie had investigated campaign donations made by Kushner's father Charles, who ultimately was sent to prison for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal donations. In the Forbes interview, Kushner denied any involvement with Christie's ouster and said he and Christie \"worked very well together.\" “The media has speculated on a lot of different things, and since I don’t talk to the press, they go as they go, but I was not behind pushing out him or his people,\" he said. 0 Shares",

They deal with distressed customers with a lot of patience and in such a state of increased tension, they probably must have seldom come across people who understand their situation too. \nThis video however, will restore your faith in the goodness of humanity. \nEarlier, a bank official’s story of how post demonetisation, she herself hadn’t got the opportunity to withdraw money, while she patiently dealt with the customers, had gone viral. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ",

    "text": "By FP Staff \nThere was absolutely no need for the government to demonetise high denomination old currency notes at a time when economy is racing ahead. This has caused a lot of liquidity distress, especially in the rural regions and triggered a steady rise in layoffs and many tragic deaths, development economist Jean Drèze has told The Economic Times in an interview . \nAccording to Drèze, the entire demonetisation exercise in a booming economy is like shooting at the tyres of a racing car. Development economist Jean Drèze \nThe former member of the National Advisory Council during the UPA rule has said the government's statement that the it is a strategy to flush out black money from the system is a mere delusion. The real targets could be political parties who are believed to be cash hoarders that are used during election campaigns, he has said. \n\"Opposition parties may well be the real targets of the demonetisation move. Being in power, the ruling party is less vulnerable. I am all for preventing fraud among political parties, but this is not the best way to go about it,\" Drèze has told the newspaper. \nMaking the high currency notes invalid has pushed rural economy in tatters already, with mandi arrivals of several non-perishable agriculture commodities like cotton, soyabean crashing sharply, according to a report in Reuters . \nThe report notes that consumer spending makes up 56 percent of India's $2 trillion economy. But with less stock of smaller denomination notes available and the difficulty to get hold of new bills, consumers are holding back expenditure. \nSupply chains at small, medium and even larger companies are breaking down, underlining just how much corporate India - not just the shadow economy - relies on hard cash. \nBrokerages have also started revising downwards the growth estimates for the economy. Ambit Capital has said the GDP growth is likely to be 0.5% in the second half of the current fiscal, decelerating from 6.4 percent recorded in the first half of this fiscal. It sees the growth in 2017-18 at 5.8%. \nThe main reason for the demand slowdown is that the country - not just rural areas but even urban - is not yet ready to make a shift to cashless mode. \nDrèze has noted that India is still several decades away from being a cashless economy, and the government needs to focus on effective banking services in rural areas to achieve its financial inclusion goal. \nHe feels Indian may witness a prolonged economic slowdown in a worst-case scenario once the demonetisation issue fizzles out. \nFirst Published On : Nov 22, 2016 13:04 IST Related News",

With Disney how leading the franchise and releasing one a blockbuster every December for the foreseeable future, the galaxy far, far away has never felt closer.

Fans were thrilled to see franchise favorite back on the silver screen, and are eager to see how their abilities with The Force have developed. Unfortunately, it appears that Leia hadn't been training in The Force, and never got herself a lightsaber of her very own. But if she were to have one, what color would it be? \nCarrie Fisher recently did an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert in order to promote her new book The Princess Diarist . When asked about what type of lightsaber she'd like, she revealed the following: \nPurple. That's in the book, too. \nOf course, this was said in Carrie Fisher's typical sardonic and irreverent tone. She doesn't seem to actually give much of a crap what her hypothetical lightsaber would be- mostly because she probably won't ever get one. While sensitive to The Force, Leia never trained to use cool tricks like telekinesis and lightsaber dueling. \nMany fans were disappointed to see that General Leia wasn't a bonafide Jedi by the time the events of The Force Awakens happened. The reveal that she was Luke's sister was a major twist in Return of the Jedi , and it was also revealed that she had some powers, like sensing Luke had survived the final battle with Darth Vader. Luke ended up taking on a bunch of padawans, but never got around to teaching his sister how to use his powers. So lame. \nLeia's utter lack of Jedi training made for a stark transition from the Star Wars novels, which are now no longer canon. In the books, Leia eventually was trained and able to wield a lightsaber of her very own. She would become a Jedi Knight in New Jedi Order, and was seen using various colored lightsabers including blue and yellow. But now it appears that Carrie Fisher would prefer that Leia had a purple lightsaber, just like Mace Windu. \nAs of late, Samuel L. Jackson's Mace Windu is the only Jedi seen using a purple lightsaber. This actually happened at Jackson's request, asking George Lucas himself if he might have a special lightsaber to help him stand out. This request was approved, and the badass Jedi got his iconic weapon. \nIt should be interesting to see how Leia continued to grow in future Star Wars movies. She didn't have a ton of screen time in The Force Awakes , but that may change for Episode VIII ; the Rebellion is helping a recovering Finn, and Poe is her right hand man. Could she eventually chose to use her Force powers? Let's hope so. \nThe next adventure in a galaxy far, far away is Rogue One: A Star Wars Story , which will fly into theaters December 16h.  ",

He says 'when I look out of my window and I see these windmills, it offends me. You've got to do something about these windmills. Let's put them offshore, why spoil the beautiful countryside?'\"\nThe exchange is said to have happened when Mr Farage visited Trump Towers in New York last week Mr Trump believes wind turbines \"sully\" the Scottish landscape During an interview with the New York Times, when asked about whether the subject of wind farms was discussed during the meeting with Mr Farage, Mr Trump said: \"I might have brought it up.\"\nMr Wigmore also said Mr Trump had described Scotland as the \"most beautiful country ever\", but that he did not want it to be \"sullied by these awful windmills\".\nLast December the Supreme Court rejected Mr Trump's challenge to the offshore wind farm project near his Menie golf resort.\nHis company the Trump Organisation previously lost two legal bids in the Scottish courts after ministers approved proposals for an 11-turbine scheme which Mr Trump said would spoil the view from his course.\nHe took his case to the Supreme Court, where justices unanimously dismissed his appeal.\nCommenting on the recent discussion about wind farms, WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: \"One would have thought Mr Trump would have far more important issues to be dealing with.\n\"The reality is that offshore wind turbines are already making a significant contribution to the UK's power supply. And, given that Scotland is home to a quarter of Europe's offshore wind resource, we should be aiming to make the most of this clean power source.\"",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump’s charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.\nThe admissions by the Donald J. Trump Foundation were made in a 2015 tax filing made public after a presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items such as a painting of himself that was displayed at one of his properties.\nThe filing’s release, first reported by The Washington Post , comes as the New York attorney general’s office investigates whether Trump personally benefited from the foundation’s spending.\nThe filing also shows Trump’s foundation accepted money from a Ukrainian businessman who also gave money to one of Trump’s favored targets on the campaign trail: The Clinton Foundation. The charity also donated to a conservative group that backed Trump during his candidacy.\nThe 2015 tax filing was posted on the nonprofit monitoring website GuideStar on Nov. 18 by someone using an email address from the foundation’s law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said GuideStar spokeswoman Jackie Enterline Fekeci.\nIn the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing doesn’t provide details on the violations.\nQuestions about the violations sent via email to Trump’s transition team weren’t immediately answered Tuesday.\nMarcus S. Owens, a partner at the Washington law firm Loeb & Loeb and a former director of the IRS exempt organizations division, said the lack of detail in the tax filing makes it difficult to determine the extent of the charity’s violations.\n“There’s no way to tell for sure whether the self-dealing is small and trivial or large and a pattern of ongoing deliberate misuse of the charity’s assets,” Owens said.\nGenerally, he said, self-dealing violations require the violator to pay an excise tax equal to 10 percent of the amount involved in the transactions. The violator also would have to repay the foundation for the full amount involved. Owens also noted that self-dealing is a violation of New York state law, where the charity is registered.\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, launched an investigation into the charity after reporting by the Post drew attention to some of the foundation’s purchases, three of which are listed in the latest filing: two portraits of Trump and a football helmet autographed by former NFL quarterback Tim Tebow.\nAs the Post reported previously, Trump bid $12,000 for the football helmet, and his wife, Melania, bid $20,000 for one of the portraits. The other portrait, which Trump bid $10,000 for, has been hanging on a wall at his golf course in Doral, Florida, according to the Post.\nDespite the high-dollar price tags, the foundation’s latest tax filing now values them at a combined $1,675. The tax filing does not specify if any of the items are related to the self-dealing violations.\nThe foundation has previously said it amended its tax filings after it gave an improper $25,000 check to a political committee supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi in 2013.\nCharities are barred from engaging in political activities, and the president-elect’s staff says the check he signed was mistakenly issued following a series of clerical errors. Earlier this year, the Trump Foundation paid a $2,500 fine to the IRS over the check.\nThe latest tax filing shows two Trump entities gave to his foundation, a break from recent years when the foundation’s donations came mostly from other donors.\nThe Trump Corporation gave about $566,000 to the foundation, and Trump Productions LLC, the company which produced “The Apprentice” and “Celebrity Apprentice,” gave $50,000 in 2015.\nAnother large contributor was the foundation of Victor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian billionaire who has advocated for closer relations between the European Union and Ukraine. The Victor Pinchuk Foundation gave $150,000 to the Trump Foundation in 2015. Pinchuk’s foundation has also given between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation.\nThe Trump Foundation’s tax filing shows that it also gave at least $10,000 to Project Veritas, a Trump-backing nonprofit group led by conservative activist James O’Keefe.\nDuring the presidential campaign, O’Keefe’s employees posed as would-be Democratic donors and volunteers during a months-long ruse that captured one Democratic operative seeming to boast about his connections to Hillary Clinton’s campaign and claiming he hired people to provoke Trump rally-goers.\nThe undercover sting prompted the Democratic Party and liberal groups to cut ties with at least two operatives.\n__\nAssociated Press writers Julie Bykowicz and Jeff Horwitz contributed to this report.",

That film, bolstered by strong reviews and repeat viewings, will likely pass $200 million at the domestic box office this weekend, and has already surpassed a global take of $500 million. \nProjections are for Moana to take the top spot, followed by last week's #1, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them , and then Doctor Strange . Moana should earn somewhere between $85 and $90 million for the five-day weekend ($60 million Fri-Sun), while Fantastic Beasts is projected for about $44 million for the 3-day weekend and $65 million for the 5-day; and Strange is looking at probably about $14 million/$19 million. \nRounding out the top five should be Arrival and Allied , a pair of live-action dramas with awards buzz. \nTwo other new releases, Bad Santa 2 and Rules Don't Apply , are scrapping with Trolls , Almost Christmas , The Edge of Seventeen , and Hacksaw Ridge for the bottom of the top ten spots. At present, Bad Santa 2 and Rules Don't Apply are sitting at #9 and #11 for the week, but they're expected to rise throughout the weekend as smaller releases don't typically open in smaller-market theaters on Wednesday, so for many locations tonight represents their opening night.

    "text": "The Trump administration should pursue the case against Hillary Rodham Clinton. \nI f there is anything more to Donald Trump than bluster, we have yet to see it. \nTrump has not even been sworn in as president, and he already is walking away from campaign promises that are too hard to keep, starting with his pledge to pursue the case against Hillary Rodham Clinton, who violated national-security laws, lied about it, and very likely suborned criminal acts by others, including obstruction of justice. Speaking in the jabberwocky that is the lingua franca of Planet Trump, Kellyanne Conway says that the president-elect already has turned his back on his swaggering campaign promise to put his opponent in jail for what are — let us keep in mind — serious crimes. “Look, I think he’s thinking of many different things as he prepares to become the president of the United States, and things that sound like the campaign aren’t among them.” Trump, she explained, is “also the head of your party now,” so when he “tells you before he’s even inaugurated he doesn’t wish to pursue these charges, it sends a very strong message.” \nThat’s a lot of words when one of two might have sufficed: “laziness” or “cowardice.” \nWhat, exactly, are those “many different things” about which the president-elect is thinking? Surely, pursuing a case against Mrs. Clinton would be difficult, especially for Trump, whose legal experience is mostly limited to local planning-and-zoning regulations, defamation claims, and bankruptcy court. It could prove politically costly in the event that it is unsuccessful — and even more politically costly in the event that it isn’t. Those are all good reasons, from Trump’s point of view, to decline to pursue the case. But among those “many different things” upon which he is meditating, there is one question that ought to trump the others: Did Clinton break the law in a manner that warrants prosecution, and did she escape that prosecution only because the Obama administration, which has politicized every federal agency from the IRS to the Justice Department to the ATF to the National Labor Relations Board, spared her from indictment in the service of its own narrow political self-interest? \nEither there is a case to be made against Mrs. Clinton or there is not. The information that has been made public by the FBI suggests very strongly that there is. The corruption of the Obama administration is not in question, and the judgment of its DOJ in this matter is therefore without much weight. \nAll of that points in the same direction: investigation. Either there is a case to be made against Mrs. Clinton or there is not. The information that has been made public by the FBI suggests very strongly that there is. \nAmerican government at all levels is characterized by a “tough on crime” posture, but there is a political reality underlying that rhetoric. We are in fact very tough — to the point of cruelty — on crimes and “crimes” that land the poor and the politically powerless in the dock: We will happily lock you up, with righteousness in our hearts, if you are caught with verboten vegetation or if you get behind in your child-support payments . We will spend millions of dollars on surveillance infrastructure for such revenue-generating novelties as red-light cameras and the like, while keeping known jihadists under surveillance is apparently beyond our capabilities. We’ll make a federal case out of it if you braid somebody’s hair without giving the politicians a cut , but we won’t make a federal case out of it when a high-ranking federal official — one who nearly became the highest -ranking federal official — violates critical national-security laws and then engages in a potentially criminal cover-up. \nDoes that strike anybody else as odd? \nIf anything, the priorities should be reversed. While it applies at all levels of government, it is especially true at the federal level that instances of official wrongdoing, whether by elected officials or career civil servants, should receive the highest priority in criminal prosecution. But we can hardly manage to fire civil servants who refuse to do their jobs because they are too busy spending their days watching porn and endeavoring to hold tightly the pelican by his mouth pouch .",

    "text": "Nov 24 2016, 12:50 am ET Trump Supports Los Angeles Bid for 2024 Summer Olympics, Mayor Says by Richie Duchon advertisement \nPresident-elect Donald Trump plans to support Los Angeles' bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics — an event that could fall during the closing months of a second Trump term — according to a spokeswoman for the city's mayor. \nTrump expressed support for the city's bid during a phone call Wednesday with Mayor Eric Garcetti, spokeswoman Connie Llanos said. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti speaks during the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Thursday, July 28, 2016. J. Scott Applewhite / AP \n\"They had a productive conversation about ways to expand infrastructure investments and opportunities in communities across America,\" Llanos said in a statement. \"And the Mayor stressed the important role that immigrants and immigration reform will play in L.A.'s — and the nation's — long-term success.\" \nLlanos said that the call was brief and that it came after Garcetti reached out to the president-elect's office. \nGarcetti was a strong supporter of Hillary Clinton and a vocal opponent of Trump, calling him a \"political pyromaniac\" during a speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. \n\"Donald Trump has no vision for our country and no genuine answer to our challenges,\" Garcetti said at the DNC in July. \"Elect Donald Trump and get empty promises.\" \nThe two are also miles apart on immigration policy. Garcetti in 2014 ordered Los Angeles police not to grant U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's standing request to detain immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. \nTrump threatened during the presidential campaign to cut off federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities, and he pledged to deport any undocumented immigrant taken in by law enforcement without regard to the severity of their crimes or whether they were convicted. \nLos Angeles County was home to about 1 million of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally in 2014, according to data published by the Migration Policy Institute. \nGarcetti told the Associated Press in August that Trump could be a liability to L.A.'s Olympic bid, but his administration could also bring some expertise. Mitt Romney, who Trump is considering for Secretary of State , was president and CEO of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. \nLos Angeles is competing with Paris and Budapest, Hungary to host the 2024 Olympics.

    "text": "PETALING JAYA: Every day, Ramlah Hashim gets up early to prepare and cook for her small nasi lemak business. \nFor some years now, she has had to depend on her married daughter to help operate her stall in Bandar Utama because her knees hurt when she stands for too long.\nBut the 60-year-old cannot afford to rest because she still has her grandson Muhammad Farish Haki­mi Mohd Faizal, 12, to look after. \nHer tireless efforts were rewarded when he became the only pupil in his school, SK Damansara Jaya 2, to score straight As in the recent UPSR exam. \nMuhammad Farish’s achievement is no small feat as he is among just 4,896, or 1.11%, of the 452,721 UPSR students who scored straight As nationwide. \nRamlah said she smiled with pride when her grandson’s name was announced as the only pu­­pil with a perfect score in the school. \n“He has always been a bright boy. He could read since he was five and his pre-school teachers had always told me that he’s a smart boy,” said Ramlah, who has been selling nasi lemak for 34 years.\nShe has been taking care of Muhammad Farish since he was a baby at their home – a low-cost apartment in Kayu Ara – after his mother passed away due to an illness. The boy’s father, who has remarried, lives elsewhere.\nRamlah earns some RM1,000 each month from selling nasi lemak, RM250 of which has to be set aside for their home instalment. \n“We’ve always told Muhammad Farish that he doesn’t have his mother anymore and the only thing he can do for himself is to study hard,” Ramlah said in an interview. \nThe advice stuck with Muham­mad Farish, who aspires to be successful some day so he can take care of his grandmother in turn. \n“I want to become a CEO of a big company because CEOs earn a lot and I want to buy her a lot of things,” he said.\nHowever, this does not mean that Muhammad Farish spends all his time studying because like any other boy his age, he is into video games and football during his spare time. \n“He doesn’t like to study at home. Whenever I tell him to study, he would only open the book but he won’t study. He prefers to study at school,” his grandmother said.\nMuhammad Farish’s only secret to scoring excellent results was to pay attention during class.",

LP/Jérémy Bouillard Jérémy Bouillard Drancy Agir Ensemble Idriss Niang Sécurité Routière Permis de Conduire \n« Beaucoup de jeunes ici ne peuvent pas se payer le permis de conduire », rappelle Idriss Niang, le dynamique président de l’association drancéenne Agir ensemble. Le dernier né de ses projets, « Agir ensemble pour la sécurité routière », vise à donner un coup de pouce financier à une vingtaine de jeunes de la ville qui souhaitent passer leur permis de conduire. La seule condition posée par l’association : être en classe de terminale, quel que soit le cursus. « Le permis est nécessaire pour aller travailler mais aussi pour aller étudier, donc on a tous les profils », complète le président d’Agir Ensemble, qui décrit le projet comme « une action d’insertion ». « On prend 20 jeunes mais il y en a une centaine d’autres qui attendent leur tour », note-t-il. \nGrâce à un premier partenariat avec l’auto-école SLG Salengro de Drancy, Idriss Niang a obtenu un rabais de 300€ par permis, faisant ainsi passer son prix de1300€ à 1000€. Avec la participation de quatre partenaires, La Société Générale, Mac Halal, le service des marchés et Pizza Hut, le prix est descendu à 600 €. Idriss Niang ne compte pas s’arrêter là et cherche d’autres partenaires. \nEn échange de ce permis à petit prix, les jeunes bénéficiaires doivent assurer, pendant un trimestre, trois heures de soutien scolaire hebdomadaires dans les locaux de l’association. En classe de terminale scientifique, Eddy Jebrane a commencé il y a un mois et demi les cours de code, comme les 19 autres jeunes. Il dispense des cours de soutien en mathématiques et physiques depuis déjà deux ans. « Apprendre aux petits, j’ai toujours aimé ça, confie ce jeune homme de 17 ans. On essaye de leur transmettre des choses de façon agréable. » \nLa mission des lycéens ne s’arrête pas là. Une fois le Code de la route en poche, ils devront assurer une mission de sensibilisation à la sécurité routière auprès de collégiens et d’élèves de primaire. Une dizaine d’heures au total pour chaque jeune. « C’est un projet donnant-donnant à tous les niveaux », conclut Idriss Niang. leparisien.fr Jérémy Bouillard",

I can't find any other words to describe it,\" he told Sputnik. \nMarcin Damagała also noted that Fotyga, who was Polish Foreign Minister from 2006 to 2007, apparently lacks any understanding of the ongoing processes on the international arena, something she has from the very beginning of her political career. © Sputnik/ Alexei Druzhinin 'They Keep Trying to \"Teach\" Us Democracy', But Bans Aren't The Way - Putin on EU Resolution There is a feeling, he said, that the politician is reviewing certain TV and radio stations with the only purpose of banning them. \"The adopted resolution however shows the high professionalism of Russian mass media and proves that European journalism, in turn, is so scanty and propagandistic that European readers and listeners prefer turning to the outlets broadcasting from abroad in order to hear an alternative point of view,\" he noted. \nLuckily, the resolution is not binding, he said, adding that while some Europeans might not agree with what is being said by the Russian Federation, there is however no reason for a total blackout as suggested by the report. The EU should use other means to voice its discontent. Meanwhile Jaksa Scekic, Serbian journalist, producer with the Reuters agency, who used to work for Sky News, told Sputnik that the West fears the Russian media because of aggravation of relationship between Russia and the US. \nHe suggested waiting until Donald Trump moves into the office to further see how the relationship will proceed. \n\"When the two powers do not have a dialogue where they can discuss certain problems, it is natural for such rhetoric to appear,\" he said, adding that it was the same during the Cold War with Joe McCarthy's anti-communist rhetoric, and with George Galloway's, British politician's, campaign to oppose the war in Iraq. \n\"I think that if there are any changes in the Russian-US relationship after January 20, when Trump gets into office, such rhetoric will gradually disappear,\" he therefore suggested. ...",

And the Italian believes the change has benefited one player specifically. \nChelsea were looking pretty poor at the beginning of the season and their embarrassing performance against Arsenal suggested that they'd be struggling again like they did last season. \nThat was until Antonio Conte decided to do away with four at the back and change to a 3-4-3 system that many felt he would when he first rocked up to Stamford Bridge. \nAnd Conte has revealed that the system is perfect for one of his Blues players in particular. Talking to Gazzetta dello Sport about winger Pedro he said: \n\" Pedro? He has qualities of absolute excellence. He's perfect for the 3-4-3.\" \nThe Spanish winger moved to the Premier League from Barcelona last season but was poor last term as he struggled to adapt to England. \nHowever since the change in system Pedro has ousted William from the starting line up and has started the last five games for Chelsea. \nThe 29 year old has two goals and five assists to his name so far this season and it's easy to see why the 3-4-3 system is perfect for him!

    "text": "It’s been more than two weeks since the 2016 presidential election, but the final results from Michigan are in: Donald Trump won by 10,704 votes.  It’s the first time a Republican candidate won the state since George H. W. Bush in 1988. While former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won the popular vote with more than 2 million submissions, the race in Michigan was tight. By winning the state’s 16 Electoral College votes, Trump’s total increased to 306. Clinton’s is 232. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win.\nThe results were posted by Ruth Johnson, Michigan’s Secretary of State, Wednesday after all the votes were reviewed and certified by Michigan’s 83 county clerks Tuesday.\n“Many people have asked about Michigan’s process for counting ballots and certifying election results. Please be aware that all 1,521 Michigan cities and townships completed ballot counting and reported unofficial results by the morning of Wednesday, Nov. 9,” a statement on Johnson’s website reads. “The county canvassing boards, as they do after every election, then began their work to review and certify the results from each precinct.”\nHere’s how the total votes for Michigan breaks down: \nDonald J. Trump, Republican: 2,279,543  Hillary Clinton, Democratic: 2,268,839 Gary Johnson, Libertarian: 172,136 Jill Stein, Green: 51,463 Darrell L.

Former Green Party candidate Jill Stein is demanding a recount. She raised nearly $5 million, with the goal of $7 million.\nHer page states  “we cannot guarantee a recount will happen in any of these states we are targeting. We can only pledge we will demand recounts in those states” and that “if we raise more than what’s needed, the surplus will also go toward election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform.”\nClinton, however, has already conceded. “I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans,” Clinton, 69, said Nov. 9 about President-elect Trump, 70. “This is not the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard for, and I’m sorry we did not win this election for the values we share and the vision we hold for our country.”\nView photos \nDonald Trump More President-elect Donald Trump, pictured Nov. 8, 2016, won Michigan with more than 10,000 voters.

    "text": "Last iwi in Taranaki embarks on treaty negotiations with Crown DEENA COSTER Last updated 16:51, November 28 2016 ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nTe Runanga o Ngati Maru trustee Tamzyn Pue welcomed the Crown representatives onto the marae. \nThe last of Taranaki's eight iwi to settle its Treaty of Waitangi claim has put a stake in the ground over its negotiations - Ngati Maru wants its land back. \nOn Monday, the north Taranaki iwi hosted a delegation from the Office of Treaty Settlements and the Department of Conservation (DOC), including one of the Crown's chief Treaty of Waitangi negotiators David Tapsell. \nNgati Maru, who has about 2000 registered members, is in the early stages of negotiating its treaty settlement with the government but a deal is on track to be done by August 2017. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nTe Runanga o Ngati Maru lead negotiator Anaru Marshall. \nAnd a clear message was sent by the iwi to the government representatives - it wants the land illegally taken from it given back. Ngati Maru's lead negotiator Anaru Marshall said the number one issue discussed at hui about the settlement was how much land they would be getting back through the treaty deal. \nREAD MORE: \nThe iwi's rohe stretches from the eastern side of Mt Taranaki to the source of the Waitara river, across to the Heao Stream and down to the Whanganui river and back across the Matemateaonga ranges to Stratford. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nFollowing a formal powhiri, refreshments were laid on for the manuhiri at Te Upoko o te Whenua marae in Tarata. \nHistorian Pare Hayward said during the 1850s, having survived inter-tribal warfare, Ngati Maru had been a prospering iwi with its own flour mill and fruit orchards. \nBut in 1865, the iwi had 220,000 hectares of land illegally confiscated from it by the Crown or sold out from under it by people who had tenuous connections to the group, leaving it with next to nothing. \nOf the large tracts of land taken off the iwi, about 80,000 hectares or 131 different sites are now governed by DOC. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nTe Runanga o Ngati Maru chairman Holden Hohaia believed negotiations were heading in the right direction. \nHayward said despite the losses and the challenges the iwi had faced in the years since, its efforts to establish a marae and to keep up connections between its members was a tribute to Ngati Maru's strength as a people. Ad Feedback \n\"That's something that demonstrates our fortitude amidst everything that was done to us,\" she said. \nTe Runanga o Ngati Maru chairman Holden Hohaia said negotiations with the government had begun in earnest about three months ago. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nCrown negotiator David Tapsell admitted the treaty process would never fully compensate Ngati Maru for its losses. \nHe said the starting principle for negotiations with the Crown is that land wrongfully taken from them would be returned. That would also apply to DOC land, Hohaia said. \nMonday's visit, which also included a tour of sites significant to the iwi, was the first time Crown officials had visited Te Upoko o te Whenua Marae in connection with the treaty settlement process. \nHe said the focus was now on coming up with an \"agreement in principle\" which the negotiating team would bring back to the iwi to consider. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nKanui Patu, 1, with dad Phillip Patu were among 50 Ngati Maru uri or descendants who met with a government delegation on Monday. \n\"I think we're making good progress,\" Hohaia said. \nTapsell told about 50 uri or descendants that it was widely acknowledged that iwi in Taranaki had suffered the most in relation to Treaty of Waitangi breaches committed by the Crown. \nHe said whenever he visited Taranaki he was always \"amazed\" at the resilience of its people in the wake of such hardship. \nBut Tapsell readily admitted to Ngati Maru the treaty settlement process would never fully compensate the iwi for its losses. \n\"It's just impossible to get you back to exactly where you were,\" he said. \nWhile the amount of money involved in the settlement had yet to be disclosed, it would undoubtedly be in the millions and meant Ngati Maru would join its other counterparts in the region in becoming a major economic player. \n\"Ngati Maru will - and rightly so - be a part of that,\" Tapsell said. - Stuff",

Some 415 million diabetics worldwide are at risk of this visual affliction and many of those living with it in the developing world lack sufficient health care access to treat it. That's why Google is training its deep learning AI to spot DR before it becomes a problem -- and without the help of an on-site doctor. \nSince the disease is most readily diagnosed by examining a picture of the back of the eye, the Google team has spent the past few years developing a dataset of 128,000 individual images, each examined by 3-7 ophthalmologists from a panel of 54. By marking damaged areas of the eye -- microaneurysms, hemorrhages and the like -- and then feeding that data into a machine learning system, Google managed to build a highly reliable diagnostic tool. When tested with 12,000 images, the system's diagnosis was \"on-par with that of ophthalmologists\" according to the Google Research Blog post. \nThe team hopes to expand the scope of this system to be able to diagnose the disease from more complex 3D images (those generated from Optical Coherence Tomography) in addition to the conventional 2D fundus photographs that it currently uses. The team is also looking into automating the diagnostic process to better serve patients in remote locations who might otherwise not have access to trained specialists. But first, Google will need to conduct studies using larger clinical groups and, eventually, obtain FDA approval.",

    "text": "Brazil head coach Tite has named his top three players of 2016 Published 24/7 \nIn case you missed it, world football’s elite players are now competing for two major individual accolades following the split between FIFA and France Football. \nThe Ballon d’Or will continue with France Football and it remains the award that the world’s best players are all desperate to land their hands on. \nFIFA, meanwhile, have introduced ‘The Best FIFA Men’s Player 2016 award’. This is the successor to the now-defunct FIFA World Player of the Year award. Article continues below \nOnly journalists can vote for the new Ballon d’Or but international coaches and captains still get a vote for FIFA’s new award. \nAnd Brazil boss Tite has already revealed how he has voted for the award, which will be presented at a glitzy ceremony in Zurich on January 9. Article continues below Arjen Robben has named his dream XI and it’s ridiculously attack-minded Tite names his top three players of 2016 \nTite, who has worked wonders with the Brazilian national team since replacing Dunga in June, could find no room in his top three for Lionel Messi despite admitting the Barcelona superstar is the world’s best footballer. \n“Messi’s the best in the world, but this year, Ronaldo has been the best,” the Brazil coach told the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper, per FIFA’s official website . “For his triumphs, Cristiano’s year has been better. \n“In second, Neymar, and in third, [Antoine] Griezmann. I left Messi out because he was injured a lot. Cristiano is direct, is fascinated with the goal. Messi is playful, creative.” Ronaldo is the firm favourite \nRonaldo is the overwhelming favourite to win the Ballon d’Or - he’s 1/12 on with certain bookmakers - and he should complete the double by also securing FIFA’s Best Men’s Player of 2016 accolade. \nThe 31-year-old is the frontrunner for both awards after winning the Champions League with Real Madrid and the European Championships with Portugal. Tite voting for Neymar isn't a shock \nNeymar is currently 33/1 to win the Ballon d’Or. \nTite will have been acutely aware that not voting for Neymar would have led to unfavourable newspaper headlines. \nNeymar did recently score his 50th goal for Brazil - he’s still only 24 and has only made 75 appearances for his national team - so you can see why Tite will have voted for the Barcelona star. You have to feel sorry for Griezmann \nAs for Griezmann, well, it’s hard not to feel a bit sorry for the Frenchman. \nIt’s been a bittersweet year for the Atletico Madrid forward who was on the losing teams in both the Champions League final and Euro 2016. \nWhich three players have been the best of 2016?

At the moment, luck is completely against us. We are playing very good and we deserve eight more points than we have.' \nAsked if he felt United were close to getting on a winning run, the 27-year-old said: 'Yes. We feel it because we are better than every opponent. \n'I don't know when the luck will change, but it's not even luck - it's just (what is) fair. We are looking for fair. \nWest Ham's Darren Randolph was man of the match as United were held to a fourth home draw\nHerrera insists that United should be eight points better off after 'unfair' results\n\n'We are looking to score maybe half of the chances we create and we will win 4-1 every game.' \nHerrera sees the number of opportunities United are creating as a clear positive. Sunday's game was overshadowed by the sending off of manager Jose Mourinho for a second time this season - something which has triggered a Football Association charge - but on the field United had 17 goal attempts to the Hammers' six. \nHerrera said: 'The best player of Burnley was the keeper, the best player of Stoke was the keeper, the best player of Arsenal was Petr Cech, the best player of West Ham was Randolph. \n'We are doing something good and we have to take good things from it. \nSunday's game was overshadowed by Mourinho being sent to the stands... again \n'We play intense, we win the second balls, we create chances, we move the ball, we control the game, we have more possession than the opponents, we shoot on goal. \n'I remember last season everyone said, 'shoot, shoot, shoot', and now we shoot I don't know how many times each game but we are not scoring. \n'It's unbelievable that we don't have six or eight points more than we have but hopefully the luck will turn in our favour.'",

    "text": "The piano ditty below, which ascends jauntily, then finishes with a tuneful flourish, sounds a bit like a jingle composed for the latest toothpaste campaign.\nThe tune was, in fact, dreamed up by a musical AI program developed at Google. And the program’s latest compositions show how combining a powerful machine-learning approach with simple musical rules can produce creative works that sound remarkably human.\nMusic composition is an enigmatic form of human creativity. Songwriting programs already exist, but they typically follow a specific set of rules, and they tend to produce tunes that feel rigid and mechanical. The same is true of software that recommends music based on your listening habits (see “ The Hit Charade ”). Teaching computers to be more musically inventive may point to ways that machines can help with other creative acts, from designing products to writing eloquent text.\nGoogle has previously demonstrated its music-generating AI songsmith, which is part of a project called Magenta that’s aimed at fostering artificial creativity (see “ OK, Computer, Write Me a Song ”). A large neural network is fed tens of thousands of songs, and trained to predict the next note in a sequence. Such a network can also generate new music when given a starting point, although the results tend to lack structure and grace.\nDouglas Eck , a research scientist at Google who’s leading the development of the music-generating AI, together with Natasha Jaques, an intern at the company, recently devised a way to make the songwriting systems produce much more elegant and catchy tunes. They use an approach known as reinforcement learning to add simple principles of music theory—avoid repeating a refrain too often, do not play too quickly or slowly, and so on—to the overall learning process. The network receives a positive reward every time it produces a sequence of notes that not only resembles the patterns seen in previous songs, but also adheres to the musical rules it has been given.\n“These are simple rules taken from a music composition textbook,” Eck says. “The combination of these rules with reinforcement learning, and the variance of the real world coming from thousands of human compositions, gives us songs that are so catchy—they scratch some itch.”\nThe new approach certainly seems to improve automated music generation. Another snippet of music shows how the program fares without these rules to follow. The piece is feels flat, repetitive, and mechanical. Eck and Jaques also conducted a user study and found that people much preferred the compositions produced using the new technique.\nEck says the ability to embed rules in reinforcement learning will be useful in many areas, including robotics, recommendation systems, and language translation.\n“There is no reason why machines cannot be curious and creative,” says  Jürgen Schmidhuber , a professor at the University of Lugano in Switzerland who performed pioneering research on the type of neural networks used by Google’s researchers, and who has experimented with creativity using reinforcement learning. Schmidhuber adds that the approach could have a range of practical applications beyond music. “One could imagine similar combinations of [neural networks] and traditional rule-based expert systems for medical diagnosis,” he says.\nReinforcement learning offers a way to teach machines to do things that would be difficult to achieve through explicit instruction. The technique was employed by AlphaGo, a program developed by Google researchers to play the ancient board game Go. While the rules of Go are simple, it is hard to explain how to play well, and players normally develop an intuitive aptitude through many hours of practice. But sometimes it may be useful to be able to give explicit instruction to a machine-learning system as well.\nStevan Harnad , a professor of psychology at the University of Quebec in Canada who has studied artificial creativity, says the Magenta work is impressive, but adds that there is still a long way to go before computers can be credited with real, human-like creativity. “Deep-learning algorithms are very promising, but so far they have not yet duplicated ordinary, noncreative human capacity, so it’s a bit premature to expect them to be creative,” he says.\nIn fact, Harnad says, even compositions like those produced by the Google team often appear mechanical after a few listens.",

    "text": "Diana Budds 11.29.16 8:00 AM \nHenry Ford was famous for saying a customer could have any color of car she or he wanted, so long as it's black—a nod to how the industrialist viewed color, all function no fun. Black paint dried the fastest, and that mattered more than the expressionistic qualities of different colors. Many modern architects shared a similar obsession with the sterile white box and dismiss color as mere ornament. \nNot Le Corbusier. The renowned Swiss architect believed color was instrumental to orchestrating spatial effects. In a series of wallpapers for the Swiss company Salubra, he rhapsodized about his color theories. \"Each of us, according to his own psychology, is controlled by one or more dominant colors,\" he wrote in a 1931 swatch book for the brand , which was inspired by his Architectural Polychromy essay from 1930. A rare, intact copy of the swatch book is on the auction block this week at Swann, in New York . \nIn the book, Le Corbusier created color palettes organized like keyboards . Sliding a cardboard cutout—called a key hole—along the pages creates color harmonies. Think of them as the visual equivalent of a tonal chord. The 1931 edition of the book included 43 different colors; in 1956, he added 20 more hues. His theory revolved around three concepts: using natural colors to create atmosphere, applying synthetic pigments for contrast, and deploying transparent synthetic pigments to alter surfaces without affecting how the eye perceives space. His motivation for getting into wallpaper was to ensure that his color choices would be replicated exactly as he wished, without the nuances and variations inherent in paint. [Photo: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images] \nThe Salubra book is organized into 12 different cards that represent color families. Each card is composed of three color bands—all subjectively chosen by Le Corbusier, who was also painter—and the key instructed people on what three to five colors contrasted well with each other. So while he wouldn't tell you exactly what color to pick—that was up to the individual—he would tell you what goes well together and what should be an atmospheric paint (meaning something to use for an entire wall) versus a contrast (a bolder color to be used sparingly). \n\"Color theory allows a designer to truly manipulate the interior and reflect the psychological needs of the clients and the task at hand,\" says Christine von der Linn, a senior specialist at Swann says. \"It outlined color in a very systematic theoretical way. Light, dimension, supporting walls, and accent walls all go into designing a space. Color is like an architectural addition to the room—you can manipulate reaction to a space and how it feels with pigment just as much as if placing a window or and beam.\" \nAccent walls might seem like a cliche in interior design today. But to Le Corbusier, they were the backbone of an interior. The Salubra swatch book will be auctioned off on December 1 at Swann.

    "text": "4 \nThe following story contains spoilers about the “Fall” edition of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . Proceed at your own peril. \nThe bulls–t really hit the fan in “Fall,” the fourth and final installment of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , when Emily Gilmore took advantage of Netflix’s decidedly loose standards and practices and dropped a handful of bulls–ts during what would be her final meeting with the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). PHOTOS Gilmore Girls Revival: The 28 Best Quotes \nKelly Bishop , the actress spouting the expletives, tells me in the following video that the crowd-pleasing S-bombs were “so much fun” to deliver, before conceding that the sequence was not the easiest to shoot given the number of Gilmore newbies involved. \n“Picking up the Gilmore speed — the clip on the dialogue — is always tricky for actors who aren’t around all of the time,” she explains. “So it got a little hard at times. It’s scary because the words are really flying.” (Bishop goes on to liken the show’s demanding pace to playing a game of double-dutch jump rope, which, for the record, I feigned ignorance of because I wanted to see where this bit was going. I was also beyond flattered she deemed me too young to know what the concept was!) \nRELATED Gilmore Girls : Who Played Emily’s Maid Berta? (Hint: It’s Someone You Know) \nCougar Town ‘s Carolyn Hennesy, whose DAR figurehead Toni led the charge to oust potty-mouthed Emily, seems to back up Bishop’s account of the shoot in the second video below, telling me that Gilmore ‘s grand dame, “Takes no nonsense from anybody ,” adding that she was “razor sharp with her lines and razor sharp with every nuance” in the scene. \n“She’s one of the great, great, great broads,” Hennesy adds, effusively. “She’s beautiful and smart and wise and so funny. Her sense of humor is like stepping in a big pile of leaves. It just crackles. She’s delicious in every way.” \nPress PLAY below as Bishop and Hennesy reflect on my No. 5 favorite moment from the Gilmore Girls revival. If you like TVLine, you'll LOVE our weekly newsletter.

    "text": "US military unable to win major wars, Trump-affiliated think tank warns Published time: 28 Nov, 2016 15:22 Edited time: 28 Nov, 2016 15:23 Get short URL FILE PHOTO. © Kai Pfaffenbach / Reuters All branches of the US military – Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps – have shrunk so much that they are now incapable of winning two regional wars at once, a report from an influential think tank that helped shape Donald Trump’s defense views says. \nThe Heritage Foundation, an influential Republican think-tank, says that none of the branches of the US armed forces is strong enough to deal with threats to Washington’s interests, whether actual or perceived, coming from around the world. \nA new report entitled ‘2017 Index US Military Strength’ assesses the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, giving them a collective grade of “marginal” for total capability, checked against a top score of “very strong.” The Army, the backbone of the US military, has been branded “weak.” Read more Top US general warns Congress military unprepared for ‘great power war’ while fighting terrorism \nThe Army’s active “end strength” has dropped from 566,000 troops in 2011, and is projected to stand at 450,000 troops by 2018, while the number of 4,500-strong Brigade Combat Teams (BCTs) has fallen from 45 to 31. Only 13 of those 31 BCTs are considered fully combat-ready, and nine are currently involved in ongoing operations, leaving only three to deal with emerging contingencies, the Heritage report said. \nAnother principal branch of the US military, the Navy, is said to be short of the number of ships needed to project power abroad. The US Navy, which now has the largest aircraft carrier fleet in the world, has 274 combat-ready vessels, while the think-tank believes it needs 346 to be considered at full capacity. \n“Without significant funding increases in procuring more vessels across ship types each year, it appears unlikely that the Navy will reach its own capacity goals for the foreseeable future,” the index says. \nThe Heritage index is based on measuring the US military’s ability to confront and defeat two major adversaries at the same time. In 2014, the Obama administration downgraded that criteria, saying the Pentagon must be capable of defeating a regional adversary in a large-scale conflict, while inflicting unacceptable damages to a second aggressor in a separate theater. Read more NATO can’t fight Russians in Europe, says leading US think tank \nIt also listed the US’ primary adversaries, ranking them on a five-point scale for aggressiveness (from “hostile” to “benign” ) and military strength (from “formidable” to “marginal” ). Notably, Russia, China, and Iran were labeled “aggressive” (four out of five on the aggression scale), while Russia’s capabilities were assessed as “formidable” (five out of five). All of the countries mentioned in the list were said to pose “high” threats to the US’ “vital interests.” \n“Russia and China continue to be the most worrisome, both because of the investments they are making in the modernization and expansion of their offensive military capabilities and because of the more enduring effect they are having within their respective regions,” the Heritage index asserted. \nThe report is very much in line with previous remarks made by top US military brass, who repeatedly claim that the country’s readiness for a “great power war” has been depleted. In the European theater, NATO officials argue the bloc is no match for an “assertive” Russia. \nRussian, as well as Western, experts and military officials believe that those statements have more to do with trying to increase the size of the US’ military budget than countering threats. According to the National Priorities project , the US military budget makes up 37 percent of the world’s military spending. \nThe Heritage Foundation is believed to have heavy influence on people in President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, according to the Wall Street Journal . The think-tank reportedly has dozens of current or former staff members involved in the transition, including one of Heritage’s co-founders, Ed Feulner. \nAccording to the Washington Times , Heritage has also provided expertise to the Trump campaign and deployed some of its analysts on the defense transition team.",

    "text": "Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin with a post on her public Facebook account appeared Wednesday to confirm a report that she’s under consideration by President-elect Donald Trump to become secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nThe post included a highly stylized video produced by SARAHPAC, her political action committee, about the former vice presidential candidate’s ideas on how to fix the troubled agency, and a link to the ABC news report that first broke the news of her vetting by the Trump transition team. ABC said that both a Palin aide and the Trump transition team confirmed she’s under consideration to run the VA.\n“We should be grateful we’ll soon have a commander-in-chief who will champion our vets and honor the promises our nation made; a pro-private sector individual who surely understands bigger government is NOT the answer; a President who promised to drain the swamp and clean up all government corruption … all things our vets and active duty troops deserve,” Palin wrote, followed by an American flag emoji.\nPalin, who unsuccessfully ran on a ticket with Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., in 2008, would take the helm of an agency marked by scandal and crisis. The VA also stands at a policy crossroads, with many lawmakers in favor of allowing veterans to more widely use private doctors and hospitals, a plan vehemently opposed by many Democrats and some veterans groups. In 2014, lawmakers scrambled to expand access to VA health care when it was discovered that some veterans seeking care were waiting so long that they died before seeing a doctor.\nPalin, who is known for her brash speaking style, if tapped and confirmed would also inherit a position in which current VA Secretary Robert McDonald received considerable blowback for a public statement made about wait times. McDonald was excoriated by lawmakers and advocacy groups for comparing VA wait times to lines at a Disney theme park.\nPalin’s video lays out three major platforms for what she wants to see from federal veterans’ care: allow veterans to receive care in the private market through vouchers, allow veterans re-entering the civilian workforce to use military certifications in place of civilian ones for job skills, and maintain veterans’ retirement benefits.\nThose changes won’t come without a price. For example, lawmakers are currently grappling with how to extend a $10 billion private care program that expires in August 2017 or whenever the money allocated to it runs out. Recently, CQ reported that the program, while designed to provide a new route of access for patients facing distance issues or long wait times, was mostly serving veterans who couldn’t get the care they wanted at a VA facility. That’s triggered questions about whether the program is being administered in the way it was intended.\nThere’s also a slew of concerns from House authorizers about the way the VA is spending money on a construction project in Denver and reports of lavish art purchases at medical facilities — issues which were the subject of a federal subpoena issued by House lawmakers in September.",

    "text": "Highway Patrol sergeant under investigation after he was found at home while on duty \nPosted 6:00 p.m. today   Find News Near Me \nGoldsboro, N.C. — The State Highway Patrol is conducting an internal investigation of a patrol sergeant who WRAL Investigates found at home when he was supposed to be working – even during a state of emergency. \nWRAL Investigates received a tip two months ago that Sgt. Maurice DeValle, an 18-year Highway Patrol veteran and a supervisor who makes $69,000 a year, wasn't showing up for his full work shifts. \nA news crew spent weeks tracking DeValle on various days he was working and routinely found his cruiser in the driveway of his Wake County home while he was on the clock, including while other Highway Patrol troopers put in nearly 24,000 hours of overtime during and after Hurricane Matthew responding to stranded drivers and keeping people off flooded roads. \nMuch of eastern North Carolina was under a state of emergency on Oct. 14, and the Neuse River was 10 feet above flood stage in Goldsboro. Dozens of Wayne County roads were impassable, but DeValle, one of the highest-ranking Highway Patrol troopers in the county, wasn't there when he was supposed to be. Instead, WRAL Investigates found his state-issued cruiser at his home more than an hour after he reported to the patrol that he was on duty in Wayne County. \nAccording to Highway Patrol policy, troopers \"... must be in their assigned duty station at the beginning of their assigned shift.\" \nBut that hasn't been the case for DeValle on a number of occasions: Oct. 1: DeValle reported he was on duty, but he never left his home for at least three hours. Oct. 6: DeValle was at home at 6:45 p.m., hours after reporting to patrol dispatch that he was on the road. Nov. 11: DeValle was at home an hour after calling in that he was on duty. \nPatrol officials said supervisors aren't allowed to complete paperwork at home while on the clock. All work must be done in the duty station, they said. \nWRAL Investigates also raised questions about where DeValle lives. His home is 35 miles from the Wayne County line – a 40-minute drive – although Highway Patrol policy requires troopers to live in the county where they work or get special permission to live within 20 miles of the county line. \nOfficials said he never obtained a special exemption to live outside of that 20-mile limit. \nDeValle hasn't responded to repeated requests for comment. \nAfter WRAL Investigates took its information to the Highway Patrol, officials placed DeValle on administrative duty and took away his cruiser, pending the outcome of the internal investigation.

Yet, at the same time, almost 40 percent of New Yorkers say they can’t afford to live here, the Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found. \nSixty-five percent of New York City voters said they’d rather remain here, while 32 percent say they would move out if they had the chance, according the poll. \nManhattanites were the most fiercely loyal, with 74 percent saying they wanted to stay. While Staten Islanders were the most ambivalent, with 57 percent saying they wanted to stay. \nBut roughly 37 percent of those surveyed said they can’t afford to live here, the poll found. This sentiment was highest among black voters, with 57 percent saying the city is too expensive. And 41 percent of white voters felt that way. \n“Sure it’s a nice place to visit, and people do want to live here. At least most of us do,” Maurice Carroll, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll, said in a statement. “But, if the city is nice, it’s not cheap. Half of New Yorkers say they can’t afford to live here.” \nBrooklynites felt most burdened, with 52 percent saying they can’t afford it here. In Manhattan, only 38 percent said it was too expensive. \nThe survey results should come as little surprise. \nNearly 900,000 of the city’s rental households —roughly 42 percent of renters — are rent-burdened, according to a report from the Citizen’s Budget Commission. That means they pay more than 30 percent of their household income on rent. Half of those households are “severely” rent burdened, paying more than half their income on rent. \nThe city also continues to struggle to address the record number of homeless people, with 60,000 individuals in shelters. \nAnd while the city is becoming increasingly expensive, the quality of life here isn’t all that great, according to those surveyed in the Quinnipiac poll. \nOnly 7 percent of New York City voters rated the quality of life as “very good.” \nIn the last few years, the quality of life in the city has gotten worse, 44 percent said. \nThe poll, conducted from Nov. 9 to 15, surveyed more than 1,200 New York City voters via land lines and cellphones.",

    "text": "Georgia Man Celebrates His White Maleness By Refusing To Learn the Election Results \n\"It is very peaceful in my bubble of ignorance.\" By Hannah Smothers WXIA Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In what is perhaps the most creative demonstration of Being a White Guy the United States of America has ever seen, a gentleman from just south of Savannah, Georgia is living in what he calls a \"bubble of ignorance\" by refusing to learn the results of the presidential election. While Joe Chandler said he was invited to watch the results of the election roll in like all other good citizens did, he declined — deciding, instead, to sleep. \"All I wanted to do is give myself twenty-four hours of blissful ignorance,\" Chandler told the Today Show Saturday in a Skype interview (it's hard for him to leave his home in post-election America). But then those twenty-four hours turned into a day, and into two days, and now Chandler has lived nearly two weeks in Trump's America without even knowing he's living in Trump's America. Chandler seems to be at peace in his cozy nest of white male security, and as long as he is inside of that nest, he is almost certainly aging more slowly than the rest of us. \"Having subtracted myself from this political fracas and all of the mayhem of the digital media, I kind of found the center of the cyclone, it is very peaceful in my bubble of ignorance,\" he told Fox 5 . How does Chandler pull off such a feat? It's simple, really. According to WXIA news , he works from home as an artist, making it easy to avoid contact with humans who are painfully aware of the hellscape that stands just on the other side of the new year. He's turned off his cellphone, avoids newspapers, and on his jaunts through town, wears headphones and a sign that reads: \"I don't know who won, and don't want to. PLEASE DON'T TELL ME!\" It certainly doesn't hurt that our favorite new bubble boy Joe Chandler is a white man, meaning he doesn't have to find out who won because it literally doesn't matter to him. He won't be forced to join any sort of registry , or be kicked out of the country for his undocumented status, or lose access to free birth control , should he ever decide to descend from his throne of White Male Ignorance, and join the rest of us here in hell. Greetings from hell, Joe! It's so toasty down here. Chandler told WXIA he doesn't have an \"exit plan\" for safely exiting his privilege bunker and crawling back into the sentient world, but when he does finally find out who the next ruler of the free world is, he plans to finally reveal who he was \"rooting for\" all along. I sure do wish Joe Chandler would free us from this misery of not knowing who he wanted to win the presidency. I feel I can speak for everyone when I say not knowing the status of Joe Chandler's political beliefs is causing many a sleepless night across America. Follow Hannah on Twitter . ",

    "text": "  Lionsgate: Two New Vestron Video Titles Heading to Blu-ray Posted November 21, 2016 03:59 PM by Webmaster Pre-order Now Lionsgate Home Entertainment will add two new titles to its recently launched Vestron Video Collector's Series line: Ken Russell's The Lair of the White Worm (1988), starring Amanda Donohoe, Hugh Grant, Catherine Oxenberg, Peter Capaldi, and Sammi Davis, and Bob Balaban's Parents (1989), starring Randy Quaid, Mary Beth Hurt, and Sandy Dennis. The two releases will be available for purchase on January 31. The Lair of the White Worm Synopsis: James D'Ampton (Grant) returns to his country castle in England. Legend has it that James' distant ancestor once slayed the local dragon- a monstrous white worm with a fondness for the sweet flesh of virgins.

    "text": "Zlatan Ibrahimovic names the stronger team between Man Utd and PSG Published 24/7 \nSix goals in 11 Premier League games - seven in all competitions - represents a decent start to life at Manchester United for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. \nWhile it's been a hard transition for the Swede, who scored an incredible 38 league strikes for Paris Saint-Germain last term, he's proved a worthy addition for Jose Mourinho. \nUnited's manager certainly seems pleased with his arrival on a free transfer, saying last month : \"I'm really happy. He's giving us exactly what we need from him. Article continues below \n\"It's quite beautiful for me to meet him five or six years later (after they worked together at Inter Milan) and to find the same ambition, passion and desire to play, desire to compete. \n\"I couldn't be happier. The guy is really fit. He's always ready to play. I couldn't be happier in terms of his influence in the dressing room.\" Article continues below Angel Di Maria names Arsenal's most dangerous player - and why \nHowever, in a recent interview with Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet , Ibrahimovic discussed his move to United and explained how Mourinho made a tough decision an easy one. \nWhat's more is the 35-year-old regards United - 20-time champions of the Premier League - as a step down from PSG, who he claims are the stronger side. \n\"The team I signed for this summer is not as strong as the one I left,\" he said, \"but when Mourinho called the decision was easy. \n\"When he calls I have no problem coming, all we had to decide was when I was to be presented as Manchester United player. The rest, the financial deal, was not the difficult part. \n\"It was about the challenge really, and I will never say no to a challenge. \n\"This is what I wanted: coming to one of the world's biggest clubs, that has had troubles and not won much of late, and try the Premier League. That is the challenge.\" \nIbrahimovic might have to wait another season for Premier League glory following what has been a mediocre start for United. \nWith 12 games played, the Red Devils sit sixth in the table and on 19 points, six behind fourth-placed Arsenal and a further three off Chelsea, who currently sit top. \nGoals have arguably been United's biggest problem this term. Despite possessing the likes of Ibrahimovic, Anthony Martial, Wayne Rooney and Marcus Rashford, they've scored a meagre 17 times. \nIndeed, without Ibrahimovic against Arsenal on Saturday, Paul Pogba and Juan Mata were their top goalscorers with two each, although Mata scored his third of the season during the draw. \nFurther difficult fixtures await United in the coming weeks, starting with West Ham this weekend and followed by Everton away and Tottenham at home. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

    "text": "Update : The Fitbit Flex 2 is now out ready for Black Friday and Christmas 2016. Look down below to see how it ranked in our best fitness band round-up.\nA fitness tracker is the perfect way to monitor your activity easily and with unmatched accuracy. Think of it as an electronic finger on the pulse, constantly measuring your vitals, quality of sleep and step count.\nToday's fitness band market is stuffed with compelling devices, most of which can do a pretty good job at the basics of tracking. But frankly, we're only concerned with the best, and you should be too.\nHere are 7 fitness tracker tips to get you started. We won't be looking all techy wristwear here - check out our best smartwatch guide too.\nIf you're looking for a fitness tracker recommendation though, you've come to the right place. Here, we'll showcase the best devices out there, and explain how they rank against each other in terms of stand-out features, price, design and the quality of their companion software – all of which are worth considering when monitoring something as important as your health.\nCheck out our list of the best Fitbit fitness bands\n1. Fitbit Charge 2 The best fitness tracker you can buy\nSize: Three sizes | Display: OLED | Weight: N/A | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Battery: 5 days | Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0\nBig screen Comfortable strap Limited phone notifications No GPS The Fitbit Charge 2 is the best fitness tracker you can buy right now. It's more expensive than most of the other options from Fitbit, but if you're looking to go jogging this is a great choice that won't cost you as much as a traditional running watch.\nIt connects with the GPS on your phone, has a large screen to display your data, a heart rate tracker and new fitness features we've only previously seen on the Fitbit Blaze .\nRead the full review: Fitbit Charge 2\n2. Samsung Gear Fit 2 Samsung's wearable has never been more Fit\nSize: 11.2mm x 24.5mm | Display: 1.5-inch AMOLED, 216 x 432 | Weight: 28g | Compatibility: Android | Battery: 3-4 days | Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0, GPS\nWorks on all Android phones Impressive value No iOS support Barometer issues Samsung's Gear Fit 2 has made hefty changes to its wearable line both inside and out and the result is an Android-friendly device that does a whole lot for your money.\nIt has a gorgeous design, a big display and doesn't cost all that much money compared to some other fitness trackers. The only problem is it won't work with your iPhone or Windows device, you'll need to have an Android to use the Gear Fit 2.\nRead the full review: Samsung Gear Fit 2\n3. Microsoft Band 2 Excellent mix of step counter and proper gym/running/cycling companion\nSize: 12.8mm x 32mm | Display: 320 x 128 AMOLED | Weight: 55g | Compatibility: Windows, Android, iOS | Battery: 2 days | Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0\nPowerful, versatile fitness tracking Looks much better than the v1 Band It's not cheap Short battery life With a better screen, greater comfort and a better look than the first Microsoft Band , this packs 11 sensors (one new one: a barometer to measure altitude and track stairs and hills climbed, plus an accurate optical heart rate sensor, 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, ambient light sensor, skin temperature sensor, UV sensor, capacitive sensor, microphone and a galvanic skin response sensor). There's full Cortana integration on Windows Phone, while Android and iOS devices get calendar and message notifications.\nIt's as good for the gym, running, cycling, golf and other sports as it is for counting steps and tracking sleep. The two-day battery life (less if you hit the GPS hard) is not amazing, but it does charge fast, hitting 80% in 30 minutes and 100% in 90. Apart from the Fitbit Surge, it's more powerful than everything else here put together.\nRead the full review: Microsoft Band 2\n4. Fitbit Flex 2 Fitbit's Flex is back for round two\nSize: Two sizes | Display: N/A | Weight: N/A | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Battery: 5 days | Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0\nFun software Comfortable and light Battery life not great Slow to charge Looking for a simple fitness tracker to take note of your steps on a day-to-day basis?\nThe Fitbit Flex 2 is the best choice for you and ranks at number four in our best fitness tracker list.\nYou'll get a comfortable and light device, but the battery life isn't fantastic. It is water resistant though, meaning you'll be able to go swimming with the Flex 2 and track how well your dip in the pool has gone.\nIf you're after a waterproof and low price Fitbit, you should go for the Flex 2.\nRead the full review: Fitbit Flex 2\n5. Jawbone UP3 Impressive design, oodles of features and sensors\nSize: 220mm x 12.2mm x 3.0mm-9.3mm | Display: N/A | : | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Battery: 7 days | Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0 LE\nImpressive UP app Good sleep tracking Sensors under-utilized Awkward charging mechanism When it comes to fitness tracker style, not many players are on the same level as Jawbone. The UP3 may have shifted how the UP bands connect to your wrist, but it still manages to exude the same Yves Behar flair of its predecessors.\nAdditionally, the fact Jawbone has managed to cram so many sensors into the body of the UP3, while somehow maintaining almost a week's worth of battery life is to be commended.\nRead the full review: Jawbone UP3\n6. UA Band Under Armour and HTC team up for a feature-packed tracker\nCompatibility: Android, iOS | Display: 1.36\" PMOLED | Thickness: 11.2mm | Battery: 5 days | Charging method: via proprietary USB charger | Waterproofing: 2ATM | Connectivity: Bluetooth LE\nLightweight, seamless design Responsive touchscreen Doesn't break the mold Slightly expensive Under Armour and HTC's joint efforts have produced a solid fitness tracker that demands your attention. If not just for its looks alone, its performance with and without the companion app, UA Record, makes it a cohesive, smart buy for those looking to get fit.\nI'd recommend this fitness tracker for anyone on the market who is looking for a stylish and fun to use device. The UA Band costs a small premium, but with that extra cash you might have saved, you'll be buying into a fantastic mashup of hardware and software.\nRead the full review: UA Band\n7. Withings Go An affordable tracker that doesn't skimp on novelty\nSize: fits wrists up to 230mm | Display: 1-inch e-ink | Weight: 9g | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Battery: Eight months | Connectivity: Bluetooth LE\nSets you free from your phone Eight-month battery life Cannot show time by default Screen lacks backlight If simplicity is key, the Withings Go is a fine fitness tracker. While there are other models that accomplish a lot more, this versatile wearable offers a surprising amount for a rather small cost.\nRead the full review: Withings Go\n8. Fitbit Charge HR A touch cheaper after the Charge 2\nSize: two sizes, S, L, L is 20.8x2x1cm | Display: 0.7-inch OLED | Weight: 22g | Compatibility: Android, iOS, Windows Phone | Battery: 5 days | Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0\nExcellent app Discreet and comfortable Weird cycle and run tracking Pulse monitoring not reliable Now able to auto-detect exercise such as cycling and running – although you're still better off telling it what you're doing if you want total accuracy – and with improved pulse tracking and the ability to set more demanding weekly fitness goals, the Charge HR is now better than ever. With a screen, an altimeter to tell you how many steps you've climbed, a pulse counter for more accurate calorie counting during exercise, plus Fitbit's excellent app and social ecosystem, this remains the best fitness band you can get.\nThe proper watch-style strap means it stays on and is comfortable, while the design is deliberately neutral and discreet. Some of the stats it pulls out are a bit odd at time, with a definite whiff of inaccuracy about them. However, it is consistent in the ways it is inaccurate, so you can still clearly see if you're getting better or worse at hitting fitness goals.\nNow the Fitbit Charge 2 is out, this model should begin dropping in price pretty rapidly - expect it to be something of a budget by for the holidays this year.\nRead the full review: Fitbit Charge HR\n9. Garmin Vivofit 2 Long battery life is the MO of this simple, inexpensive step tracker\nSize: 152-210mm | Display: 25.5 mm x 10 mm | Weight: 25.5g | Compatibility: Android, iOS | Battery life: more than a year | Connectivity: Bluetooth\nGood battery life Very cheap Not very comfortable Lacks extras A neat little fitness tracker whose battery life and waterproofing means you never need to take off. And if it were just that bit more useful and more comfortable, you would never want to take it off, either.\nYou do have to accept that all it really usefully does is count your steps and issue reminders to stay active. It has a stab at run tracking and sleep monitoring, but neither impresses. Still, it's a very solid effort for the price.\nRead the full review: Garmin Vivofit 2\n10. Withings Activite Pop An attractive analogue watch with step counting built in\nSize: Not Quote: d, but medium-sized watch size | Display: analogue watch face plus analogue step-count dial | Weight: 37g | Compatibility: iOS, Android | Connectivity: Bluetooth\nSuave design Eight-month battery life Sluggish syncing Spotty tracking accuracy A very clever mix of analogue watch and step counter, the Activité Pop takes a different approach to most fitness trackers. As well as counting steps accurately, it also has a go at counting running distances and monitoring sleep (though less successfully), and has a vibrating alarm. It works very well as a motivational device. The hand on the secondary dial on the watch face sweeps round from 0 to 100% of your step goal (set at 10,000 by default) as the day goes on.\nThe associated app is pretty good, but syncing can be very slow and unreliable. We suspect it's using a very low-powered Bluetooth connection to save battery power, because the Pop runs on a standard watch battery and lasts for eight months, which is not to be sniffed at. Bottom line: if you want a step counter that looks as good as a watch, this (or a smartwatch of course) are your only current options.\nRead the full review: Withings Activité Pop\nHere's how to get the most out of your fitness band",

He worked mostly in stained glass, frescoes, and paintings.\nSome of his most famous works are in the Saint-Leon de Westmount Church and the Church of the Madonna della Difesa in Little Italy, with his designs found in more than 200 buildings across Canada and the U.S.\nHis studio, the oldest stained glass studio in Quebec, is near the park named in his honour.\nTony Sciascia from the National Congress of Italian Canadians said Nincheri helped develop that part of Montreal.\n\"Nincheri to us was known as the Michelangelo of Montreal,' said Sciascia.\nItalithe intersection of Rachel, Pie IX, and Sherbrooke St. would be remodeled, with the small park on either side of Rachel St. being expanded to take over the pavement.\nThe result will be a more bicycle and pedestrian-friendly entrance to the Botanical Garden and the Olympic stadium.\nAs part of the change, the city has decided the park that is currently named after Nincheri will be renamed the Parc de la Ville de Quebec.\n\"To change the name of a park of someone who has contributed so much to the cultural heritage of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, It's really ridiculous, a lack of respect,\" said Sciascia.\nSciascia says he'll be mobilizing the congress ask the city to change its mind about renaming Guido Nincheri park.",

Inter. emergency services. Service expected to resume at 8:38. #STM G\n— @stm_Orange And with the snow we're getting today, the morning rush hour has proved difficult.\nThere were reports some STM buses were struggling to get up some of Montreal's steeper roads and service was disrupted on some lines in Montreal's east end.\nROAD CONDITIONS: Icy & slippery. Give yourself extra time & breaking distance from cars. Clear snow from your vehicle. Watch those corners!\n— @MontrealDrive Turcot closure details Drivers heading through the Turcot Yards or coming from the Décarie Expressway must now use the new Highway 136, which runs more or less parallel to the old highway, to get downtown.\nLousy commute downtown for West Islanders, transport minister warns However, the new highway only offers two lanes instead of four.\nThe first cars to travel on Highway 136 did so just before 5 a.m. Monday.\nAbout 5,000 vehicles travel through the interchange toward downtown at rush hour, according to Sylvie Gervais of KPH Turcot, the consortium in charge of building the new Turcot.\nThe closures will be in effect until 2018. (Transports Québec)\nAtwater exit reopened Soon, crews will start tearing down the three-kilometre stretch of the Ville-Marie that is closed.\nOnce that's done, they will build two more lanes for Highway 136, bringing it up to four in total. They should open in 2018.\nThe new lanes will be entirely off limits for 12 to 15 weekends starting in December until spring 2017 in order for workers to dismantle the old lanes.\nFor Montrealer, making a living from orange cones is bittersweet With the opening of the new highway comes the reopening of the Atwater exit to access the Southwest borough, which closed in the summer.\nThe new detours come one month after one lane connecting Highway 20 East to the Ville-Marie Expressway was blocked off as part of ongoing work on the Turcot Interchange.\nOfficials have advised commuters to use a different route, change their schedule, take public transit, or be prepared to sit in traffic.\nThe Decarie Expressway was clear earlier Monday morning heading toward the Turcot Interchange, but new closures were expected to lead to delays. (Radio-Canada)\nThe work on the Turcot Interchange isn't scheduled to be completed until 2020.\nShuttle bus service available The STM is offering a shuttle bus service running from the Agence métropolitaine de transport's new park-and-ride lot at the junction of Highways 40 and 15 (corner of Sainte-Croix and Dion) to the du Collège Métro station on the Orange line.\nThe shuttle buses will be in service from Monday to Friday during morning and afternoon rush hour, from 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. and from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m.\nThey will run every 15 minutes in the morning and every 10 minutes in the afternoon.

    "text": "Sulaimania, Iraq - \"We have lost our lands and we're probably never going to get them back. But we have to fight to save what is left of our culture. If we lose that, we have lost everything.\"\nSo I was told by legendary Iranian-Kurdish folk singer Mazhar Khaleghi who now runs the Kurdish Heritage Institute in the northern Iraqi city of Sulaimania.\nWhile a war rages against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) across the country, the Kurdish intelligentsia fear there is far more at stake than the loss of land.\nMazhar Khaleghi, head of the Kurdish Heritage Institute, in Sulaimania, Iraq [Lara Fatah] Kurds across the Middle East have been fighting existential battles for centuries - today it's ISIL (also known as ISIS), but yesterday it was Saddam Hussein's Baathist army, the Ottomans, the Persians, and of course, the British, whom they blame for cheating them out of a homeland at the end of World War I.\nToday, some 150,000 Kurdish Peshmerga form a crucial part of the ground forces in the campaign against ISIL in Iraq , most recently in Mosul. \nHowever, for people such as Khaleghi and other cultural figures, far more critical now is the battle they are fighting on the sidelines to preserve Kurdish heritage and culture. Lose this and the nation is broken forever, they argue.\nIn the city of Sulaimania, which marked its 232nd anniversary on November 14, residents have long prided themselves as champions of Kurdish culture. Founded in 1784 by an ambitious Kurdish prince to reflect the values of liberalism and cosmopolitanism, Sulaimania's residents have been at the forefront of the campaign to promote the use of the Kurdish language since the late 19th century. Before then, the language of the learned man was Persian, Arabic or Ottoman Turkish.\nThere are fewer residents today who know anything about what the city of Sulaimania once stood for - and the preservation of heritage sites is the last thing on their minds.\n\nToday, the very identity of this city is in danger as war and economic hardships result in changes in priority - and demographics.\nThe influx of Kurds fleeing persecution from surrounding villages over the decades, and now the unceasing waves of internally displaced persons (IDPs) from war-torn Iraqi provinces means there are fewer residents today who know anything about what the city of Sulaimania once stood for - and the preservation of heritage sites is the last thing on their minds.\nNor is there any serious interest shown by journalists who parachute into Kurdish cities every couple of months when there is an outbreak of any battle billed as \"decisive\".\n\"Are you really going to write a report about our museum or are you just here for a glass of tea?\" asked the attendant at the Sofy Karim House. \"Many journalists have come here before - they asked many questions but nothing came of it.\"\nThe home of Sofy Karim, a wealthy tobacco trader, was built in 1887 and sold to the Sulaimania municipality in 1996 by Karim's son, on condition that it be restored and turned into a museum to preserve and showcase the traditional Kurdish way of life.\nSulaimania's artists, historians and preservationists are pressuring the municipal authorities as well as the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to allocate more funds for similar projects - but to no avail.\nThe home of Sofy Karim, a wealthy local trader, was restored and turned into a museum [Tanya Goudsouzian] War is an expensive thing, and a festering dispute with Baghdad over illicit oil sales has meant the Kurdish region's 16 percent share of the Iraqi national budget has not regularly been paid out. Coupled with the fall in oil prices, the Kurdish region's economy has taken a hard hit. \nSet up shortly after the 2003 US-led war in Iraq, the Kurdish Heritage Institute and the Zheen Archive are among the bodies spearheading the effort to safeguard Kurdish culture and identity - and they have had to turn to private donors for help. \nThe region's stagnating economy has resulted in drastic budgets cuts. Those have meant lay-offs, and fewer staff means a lower production capacity - that means, for instance, slowing down the process of remastering old and damaged vinyl records of long dead Kurdish folk singers from across \"greater Kurdistan\".\nAt the Zheen Archive, brothers Rafiq and Sadiq Saleh have committed themselves to the collection and preservation of ancient Kurdish manuscripts that serve as testament to the contribution of Kurdish intellectuals in the greater Middle East. These include newspaper clippings about Kurds or poetry written by Kurds, or foreign-language books on Kurds penned by foreigners.\nA book penned in 1908 by Mark Sykes in the library of Zheen Archive [Tanya Goudsouzian] The Archive's bookshelves are lined with items that would make any Arabist salivate. For instance, an original copy of \"Dar-ul-Islam\", a travel-memoir by Mark Sykes, of Sykes-Picot fame, dated 1908; or another one titled \"To Mesopotamia and Kurdistan in Disguise\" by Major Ely Banister Soane. Soane served as political officer of Great Britain in northern Iraq from 1 919 to 1921, and is sometimes referred to as the \"Lawrence of Arabia of Kurdistan\" .\nThey also have newspaper clippings relating to Gertrude Bell, a woman respected by many Iraqi Arabs, but vilified by Kurds who hold her partly responsible for giving the Kurds a rotten deal when carving up the modern state of Iraq in 1920.\n\"We have items in this library that money cannot buy. If anything were to happen, and these books were gone, that means Kurdish history is gone,\" says Sadiq Saleh.\nAnd yet money is exactly what these institutions need right now to keep their battle for Kurdish culture going. Right now, the tide is not in their favour.\nFollow Tanya Goudsouzian on Twitter: @tgoudsouzian \nSource: Al Jazeera",

    "text": "IU Bloomington student Morgan Mohr named Rhodes Scholar IU Bloomington student Morgan Mohr named Rhodes Scholar Nov. 21, 2016 \nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Morgan Mohr, a senior at Indiana University Bloomington studying political science, history and feminist policy, has been named a 2017 Rhodes Scholar. She is one of 32 U.S. college students, and the only student from a Big Ten university, to receive the prestigious academic award. \nMohr, a straight-A student who will receive a Bachelor of Arts degree from IU Bloomington in May 2017, will study comparative social policy at Oxford University in England with the scholarship. She intends to pursue a career in law and public policy. \nAn avid campaigner for progressive issues and social justice, Mohr has taken active and responsible roles with political campaigns -- including Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign for president -- interned with government offices and founded campus groups to combat injustice. \n\"Morgan is a truly outstanding student and a remarkable civic leader,\" Indiana University President Michael A. McRobbie said. \"She combines a fundamentally moral vision of a compassionate and just world with a pragmatic optimism that people working together can achieve that vision. Her efforts to improve university policies and promote justice and equality have been exemplary. We at Indiana University are enormously proud that she has been named a Rhodes Scholar.\" \nThe 2017 U.S. Rhodes Scholars were announced Sunday by the Rhodes Trust. The scholarships cover all expenses for two or three years of study at the University of Oxford in England and may allow funding in some instances for four years. \nMohr will graduate in spring 2017 with majors in feminist policy through the Individualized Major Program and in political science and history, all in the College of Arts and Sciences. She has a 3.97 grade-point average and serves on the Board of Aeons, a panel of student leaders that advises the university president on policies affecting students. \nThe valedictorian of the Class of 2013 at Kokomo High School in Indiana, she came to IU Bloomington as a Wells Scholar , one of 20 winners of the university's most prestigious and competitive scholarship. \n\"I am honored and genuinely humbled to receive the Rhodes scholarship,\" Mohr said. \"Indiana University has been an infinitely rich place for me to learn, grow and work. Because of this, I will always be indebted to the Wells Scholars Program for bringing me here and for contributing profoundly to my development. \n\"I also want to thank my professors, peers and fellow activists for the exceptional work they do every day and for enabling me to join their communities,\" she said. \"I look forward to my two years of study at Oxford, but especially to tackling the challenges beyond.\" \nMohr has worked on a wide array of campaigns as an IU student. She worked for the Clinton campaign this fall, serving as an intern to the chief operating officer at national headquarters in Brooklyn, N.Y., and then as deputy operations director for the Florida Democratic Coordinated Campaign, coordinating workplace issues for a 750-member staff. \nShe has been a White House intern with the Office of the First Lady, an investigator intern with the U.S. Office of Equal Employment Opportunity, director of operations for the primary election campaign of Bloomington Mayor John Hamilton, a field organizer for the Human Rights Campaign and lead campus organizer for Freedom Indiana, which advocates for same-sex marriage and LGBT rights. \nIn fall 2015, she studied political science and history at University College in London and worked as a policy researcher for the U.K. Women's Equality Party. At IU, she founded two student groups committed to combating injustice, revived and led the Feminist Student Association and volunteered at Planned Parenthood and Middle Way House. \nThe Rhodes Scholarship is the oldest and best-known award for international study and is arguably the most famous academic award available to American college graduates. It was created in 1902 by the will of Cecil Rhodes, British philanthropist and African colonial pioneer. \nThis year, about 2,500 students sought the scholarships, and 882 applicants were endorsed by 311 colleges and universities. Committees of Selection in 16 U.S. districts interviewed the strongest candidates. \nScholars are chosen on the basis of academic excellence, leadership, ambition for impact, concern for others and potential to make a difference for good in the world. The scholarship, valued at approximately $68,000 per year, pays all college and university fees and a stipend for expenses. \nMore on Rhodes Scholarships , including a list of 2017 scholars, is available online. Below is a list of all of IU's Rhodes Scholars. 1905 -- Frank Aydelotte",

(J. Rogers, Northwestern University) Related Stories Dust-sized 'fitbits' offer new way to monitor the body from within \nBreaking a sweat? Researchers are creating a skin patch that can test those droplets while people exercise and beam results to their smartphones, possibly a new way to track health and fitness. \nThe experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it's almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin — and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona. Wearable technology: Canada emerging as a global leader \nIf you think of perspiration as just a drippy nuisance, think again. \n\"Sweat has biochemical components within it that tell us a lot about physiological health,\" said John A. Rogers, who directs Northwestern University's Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics and led the new research. \nToday's wearable technology helps people track their calories, activity and heart rate. A wearable biosensor would be \"radically different,\" Rogers said. 'Such a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.' - Zhenan Bao, Stanford University \nFor simple fitness purposes, it could give an early warning that it's time to replenish electrolytes before someone starts to feel dehydrated. But eventually, with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis. \nRogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid. How it works \nStick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change colour to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration's acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate. \nTogether, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colours and interprets what they mean. \nIn two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers' team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches' performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today — taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory. For a more real-world test, the other 12 bicyclists wore the patches while competing in a long-distance outdoor race in Tucson. \nThe patches stayed in place and worked even in the challenging outdoor race, and the patches' biochemical test results agreed with the indoor bikers' conventional sweat tests, the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Do fitness trackers really change our behaviour? \n\"It seems really practical,\" said Stanford University chemical engineering professor Zhenan Bao, who also researches novel biomedical materials but wasn't involved with the sweat patch. By simply looking at a colour change, \"such a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.\" \nIt's a growing field: Other research groups around the country, including some of Bao's colleagues, are pursuing wearable biosensors. \nRogers' sweat patches are designed for one-time use over a few hours. While Wednesday's studies used an early version that analyzed sweat just once during the exercise, he's now testing a design capable of multiple measurements over time.",

Contact me: EYLEE@thinkprogress.org 8 hrs ago Disturbing pattern of abuse at six immigrant detention centers in the South, report finds The incoming president elect wants to expand the use of detention. Stewart Detention Facility, an immigration detention center located in Lumpkin, Ga. CREDIT: AP Photo/Kate Brumback, File An estimated 45,000 immigrants are currently waiting in detention centers across the United States every night. The number may tick upwards once incoming President-elect Donald Trump takes office if he fulfills his promise to arrest and detain anywhere between two and three million “criminal” immigrants. Yet many immigration detention centers are ill-equipped to safely detain people who — for the most part — have been accused of civil, not criminal, violations. According to a new report by several human rights organizations that reviewed six detention centers in the South, some detention centers failed to provide information for detainees about legal proceedings and their rights. Detainees were found to have received inadequate medical and mental health treatment; they were also reportedly subjected to physical and mental abuse by detention center staff and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. Additionally, the report found that facilities failed to provide clean clothes and enough food, and detainees faced retaliation when they filed complaints. Three immigrant detainees died in custody in just the first six months of this year at the LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana. Late last month, Xiu Zhen Li, a Chinese immigrant, died of cancer at LaSalle, despite asking for medical treatment, and after throwing up every day for three months. And Stanley, a young Haitian immigrant, was brutally beaten and pinned to the floor after asking a guard to change the air conditioning temperature at the Baker Detention Center in Florida. Some detainees took to hunger strikes to protest harsh conditions and the lack of due process at the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, where guards reportedly shot at them with rubber bullets and pepper spray last year. While immigrants wait in deplorable conditions, they are also denied basic due process rights that would allow them to leave the facilities. Many immigrants are kept in detention centers for so long that they can “go months — even years — without feeling the sun on their skin because the detention center lacks an outdoor recreation area” at the Etowah County Detention Center in Alabama, the report alleged. Report authors also found that immigrant detainees taken into custody in the South were more likely to stay detained and have trouble obtaining release on bond, parole, and alternatives to detention when compared with detainees in other parts of the country. Alternatives to detention can include GPS ankle tracking devices and community-based supervision. The investigation spanned the course of seven months and included more than 300 interviews by SPLC researchers. The study was conducted by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild (NIPNLG) and the Adelante Alabama Worker Center. Unsanitary conditions and substandard care. thinkprogress.org The report found consistent allegations of abuse and neglect by detainees across facilities in different states. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is set to release a review of privately-operated immigration detention facilities because of higher incidences of safety and security violations at the end of November, but the impending change of administration means that review will likely be moot. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that he would triple the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to go after “criminal” immigrants, a refrain that has helped private prison stock prices jump up in recent times. “This report shows that immigrant detention centers in the South fail to ensure the rights and safety of people in their custody,” said Eunice Cho, SPLC staff attorney and author of the report. “Flooding the immigration detention system with hundreds of thousands of additional people will only lead to a grave human rights crisis.” “President-elect Trump’s deportation plan could require a massive expansion of an already broken system and the creation of a prison infrastructure that will cost billions and only exacerbate our country’s mass incarceration problem,” said Lisa Graybill, SPLC deputy legal director.",

TNN | Updated: Nov 25, 2016, 03.48 AM IST (Reuters photo) NEW DELHI: Justifying its decision to demonetise Rs 500, Rs 1,000 currency notes, the government told the Supreme Court on Thursday that the measure would stamp out black money and fake notes, being pumped in by Pakistan, and help the poor and middle class. In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the Centre pointed out the positive impact of demonetisation and said its decision would put the economy on a high growth path that would create more jobs and make housing in urban areas affordable to the poor. It said an estimated 22.4 lakh pieces of fake Rs 1,000 notes were in circulation in 2014-15 while the number of counterfeit Rs 500 notes were around 37.5 lakh. The Centre said it has adopted a \"multi-pronged and calibrated approach\" to eradicate black money and promote cashless transactions and demonetisation is a step in that direction. \"The withdrawal of existing high denomination bank notes will curb funding of terrorists. It will eliminate black money which casts long shadow of the parallel economy on our real economy. The poor and middle class, who are worst sufferers due to black money, will be benefited. It will help reduce tax avoidance and bring more transactions into the formal economy,\" it said. \" Transborder terrorism , Left-wing extremism and domestic terrorism are being funded by black money. High denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and are known to facilitate generation and hoarding of black money,\" the Centre said. It said hostile intelligence agencies, a clear reference to Pakistan's ISI, have not only been pumping in huge amount of fake Indian notes to finance terrorist groups and their operations in the country but also printing fake currency in large number to destabilise the nation. Responding to the court's query on action taken by it to bring relief to the people facing problem due to cash crunch, the government said a high-level committee is monitoring the situation on a day-to-day basis and appropriate decisions were being taken to ensure that no one suffered due to the move. \"The exercise of replacement of old notes by way of exchange and deposit is being carried out on a large scale and involves 1.30 lakh bank branches, 1.5 lakh post offices, one lakh banking correspondents and 2.01 lakh ATMs. Further there are 14,43,595 points of sale (POS) which are online and the total number of outstanding cards is 2,59,43,784,\" the government said in its affidavit. \"There is excessive use of cash in the real estate sector due to large cash transactions in purchase of land and housing property. The real estate prices get pushed up artificially. This reduces the availability of affordable housing for the poor and the middle class. Greater over the board transactions will lead to a decline in real estate prices making housing affordable to all,\" it said. \"A thrust has been made for increasing the digital payments in the economy through credit and debit cards, internet banking, mobile apps and e-wallets. In the last ten days there has been a nearly 300 percent jump in the number of transactions that have taken place by the use of cards alone,\" it said.  ",

It is meant to instil a sense of belonging, that one is more than just an employee or co-worker,” he said.\nAt the premium tile manufacturer and retailer, Feruni’s purpose forms the foundation upon which the company culture is built on.\nFerunians perform their daily tasks and make decisions based on the company’s 10 core values.\nTo get staff invested in the company, the company also has to invest in them. There are several things which Feruni has implemented towards this end, including setting up a modern office featuring an open concept equipped with various facilities, including a gym, game room and library.\n\nJoining Feruni means subscribing to something larger than oneself as an employee. “It’s like physical evidence of our values which an employee can touch, feel and see. The working environment is also meant to encourage lots of discussion,” he said, adding that decisions are made through group discussions and brainstorming sessions rather than a dictatorial method.\nThe company places a heavy emphasis on cultivating “talents”, which is what employees are called, through the provision of a platform for job opportunities.\n“We encourage internal job transfers and promotions. We believe that if the staff are passionate about their work, it will definitely take them to the next level. It has always been our driving force to allow the staff to do what they love and we do it together like a family,” Ngei said.\nFeruni provides avenues for learning including internal training, and even use the MBTI personality test and SII career interest test to help staff along this journey.\n“We have an ‘internal university’ which is by Ferunians for Ferunians. Basically, well-versed Ferunians prepare instructive and informative material which are then compiled into proper chapters. These become the tool for new recruits and internal transfer for Ferunians to use as a guide,” he said, adding that this also serves to ensure all Ferunians have the same knowledge about the job and company.\nThis programme is known as Feruniversity and is a way to create a sustainable in-house training programme.\nAs part of the believe that every Ferunian is unique and special, world-recognised physiological assessments are also used. \n“Two certified practitioners will look into each individual’s test result for further analysis for use in our follow-up programme – the Career Transformation Plan. In it, we craft a unique career plan for that Ferunian, taking into account their interests and capabilities. If they lack certain skills or knowledge needed, we will help develop it,” Ngei said, adding that skills and knowledge is something that cannot be cloned by others and this becomes an asset to Ferunians.\nHe adds that all these tests and career plan programmes are free for Ferunians.\nIn the upcoming column, Feruni will highlight ways in which it creates a world-class experience for its customers.",

I want to give the poor their rights. I am doing everything possible to ensure the middle class is not exploited and the poor get their dues,\" he said. \nHe also thanked the people, who supported the government's move despite facing currency crunch. \n\"I fall short of words in conveying my thanks to the people as they stood with me even when they had to face hardships,\" Prime Minister Modi said. \nThe Prime Minister, who was speaking after laying the foundation ceremony of the All India Institute of Medical sciences (AIIMS) in Bhatinda, said that his government does not believe in laying foundation stones but also ensures that the promises made to the people are fulfilled. \n\"The AIIMS here will benefit the local areas. This government does not only stop at laying foundation stones, but we complete all projects,\" he said. \nDefending the Centre over demonetisation, Prime Minister Modi earlier in the day said the move had empowered the common man in the fight against black money, while taking a swing at the opposition and critics saying they were flustered as they were caught off guard. \n\"Those criticizing the demonetisation move don't have problem with government's preparedness; they have problem that they didn't get time to prepare,\" Prime Minister Modi said. \n\"The common citizen of India has become a soldier against corruption and black money,\" he added while stressing on the need for India to move towards a cashless society. \nAlso on HuffPost India.",

Kennedy, Jr.’s 56th birthday, and undoubtedly, his celebration would have been a gleaming affair, much like his iconic wedding to Carolyn Bessette was in 1996. In fact, it seems that the Kennedy clan never met a party they didn’t like, especially when it came to close-knit family celebrations in Washington, D.C., and at their compound on the Cape. \nPerhaps the most famous—or infamous, rather—event of the Kennedys was JFK’s birthday celebration at Madison Square Garden in 1962. It was a Democratic fundraiser-slash-birthday salute, where Marilyn Monroe sang her sultry “Happy birthday, Mr. President” in a skin-tight dress (the dress just sold at auction for $4.8 million). But there were also more tame affairs like JFK, Jr., and Caroline’s balloon- and toy-bedecked birthday parties in the White House when they were children, and a surprise celebration for President Kennedy thrown by his White House staff. Here, a look back at the most memorable parties.",

Line coach Joe Seumalo stood on one end, secondary coach T.J. Rushing on the other. \nIn the middle knelt coach Todd Graham and defensive coordinator Keith Patterson, lifelong buddies and career coaching partners. At times during these sessions, while the players sat on folding chairs in front of them, Graham and Patterson talked only to each other, searching for answers. \nThey never came up with any. \nAs a result, ASU’s season likely flat-lined Friday night with the Sun Devils losing the 90th Territorial Cup 56-35 to an Arizona team that has struggled to score for most of this season. Despite a 5-7 record, the Sun Devils still can make a bowl game – it doesn’t appear enough teams will qualify for the 80 spots needed for 40 games – but their chances are slim. \nBOX SCORE: Arizona 56, Arizona State 35 \nIn front of 50,197 fans at Arizona Stadium, Arizona won for the first time since Sept. 17, a streak of eight losses and 68 frustrating days. The Wildcats prevailed with a strong rushing game, gashing the Sun Devils for a school-record 511 rushing yards. Their season is over, but this one – denying ASU bowl eligibility – counts for something. It’s all the Wildcats (3-9, 1-8 Pac-12) had to play for, keeping the Sun Devils home for the holiday season. They delivered emphatically. \nNo matter where fans place the blame for ASU’s defensive issues – poor recruiting, countless injuries, lack of depth – Graham and Patterson are responsible. They’ll admit as much. Fans grumbled throughout a five-game losing streak. Despite ASU Vice President of Athletics Ray Anderson’s public assurance that Graham will return next season, this result won’t help. \nRich Rodriguez and Arizona torched the Sun Devils for 588 yards, averaging 10.5 per play. Behind fleet-footed quarterback Brandon Dawkins, Arizona broke off six rushing plays of 30-plus yards. For the 11th time in 12 games, ASU gave up a scoring play of 50-plus yards (actually three), but nothing sums up ASU’s defensive issues more than this: \nArizona did not throw a pass in the second half. Not a single pass. \nMORE: ASU QB situation could reset in the spring \nThe Wildcats never had to. Their first four scoring drives of the second half required three, four, three and two plays. A team that scored 17 points in a 42-17 loss last week at Oregon State faced only one third down for most of the second half. Arizona featured three 100-yard rushers (Dawkins, Samajie Grant and Zach Green), the first time it has done so in one game in 23 years. \nASU's sixth consecutive loss ties a school record. Sophomore Manny Wilkins completed 43 of 58 passes for 372 yards and three touchdowns with one interception. Senior receiver Frederick Gammage – a former walk-on -– had a career-best 12 catches for 116 yards and a touchdown. At times in the second half, ASU showed offensive spark, but each time, its defense extinguished it. \nThe first half set the tone. Entering the game, Arizona had not scored more than 24 points in two months, a stretch of seven games. Against ASU, it took the Wildcats just seven drives to pass that total. \nOn the game’s third play, Dawkins broke through the middle for a 71-yard touchdown run. Early in the second quarter, Dawkins hit Nate Phillips for 64 yards, a play that illustrated ASU’s coverage issues for the past two seasons. Two defensive backs went to one Arizona receiver, leaving Phillips alone down the middle of the field. \nDown 28-7 – with its one touchdown coming on defense – ASU finally produced an offensive score on its final possession of the first half. Wilkins led the Sun Devils 94 yards in 13 plays, hitting senior receiver Tim White for a 21-yard touchdown just before the half. \nAs the team huddled before retreating to the locker room for halftime, Graham tried to rally his team, clapping his hands. On this night, it did little good. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nMONROVIA, Liberia – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is departing Liberia today with a promise to renew and strengthen the friendship between Canada and the West African nation. \n“Canada and Liberia have a strong relationship – one that is made stronger by our shared belief that when women and girls are full participants in the social, economic and political lives of our two countries, we will all succeed,” Trudeau said Thursday in Monrovia. Story continues below \nThe prime minister will spend Friday flying across the continent to Antananarivo, the capital city of the island nation of Madagascar, where he will lead the Canadian delegation at the summit of the International Organization of la Francophonie over the weekend. \nThe choice of Liberia for his first visit to Africa since the Liberals came to power last year surprised some observers, given there is a limited relationship and no obvious economic interests between Canada and Liberia, which was hit hard by the deadly Ebola virus in recent years. \nREAD MORE: Justin Trudeau calls for gender equality in Africa and the world on first day in Liberia \nTrudeau, however, said he was inspired by the leadership of Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who along with other women has been recognized – including with a Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 – for her role in achieving and maintaining peace and stability following brutal civil conflict. \nVIDEO: Prime Minister Trudeau visits first elected female African leader \nTrudeau spent most of his day in Liberia – the first time he has set foot in the country, although he had travelled in the region before becoming prime minister – sharing his message that the empowerment of women and girls can go a long way towards tackling the major challenges faced around the globe. \nJohnson Sirleaf said Canada and Liberia have long enjoyed a good relationship, including its support for the UN peacekeeping mission there, the more than $130 million it gave to the region as part of its response to the devastating Ebola epidemic, which affected Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and its offer to resettle Liberians during the civil war. \n“Your visit today could not have come at a more opportune time to reset relations between our two countries,” Johnson Sirleaf said in her toast to Trudeau at an official dinner Thursday night. \n“We are indeed very grateful to the government and people of Canada for their enormous support for the peace and stability of our country.” \nVIDEO: Justin Trudeau lands in Liberia, to open dialogue on gender equality with leaders \nShe said that Liberia had been on the road to recovery from the civil war, but then experienced the shocks of the 2008 financial crisis, the Ebola outbreak and the sharp decline in commodity prices for many of their exports. \n“We are determined to get past these difficult days.” \nAt the summit of la Francophonie, Trudeau plans to highlight gender equality, the fight against climate change, diversity and security, among other issues at the gathering of representatives from 80 governments and states from mainly French-speaking nations. \nCanada is also sponsoring a joint resolution on early and forced marriages with Benin, and backing a bid by Ontario to gain observer status at la Francophonie.

    "text": "Angela Merkel this week warned that fake news and bots may influence Germany’s national elections next year, days after she announced plans to seek a fourth term as the country’s chancellor. In a speech to parliament on Wednesday, Merkel said that fake news and bots have “manipulated” public opinion online, adding that lawmakers must “confront this phenomenon and if necessary, regulate it,\" the AFP reports . \n\"Something has changed — as globalization has marched on, [political] debate is taking place in a completely new media environment. Opinions aren't formed the way they were 25 years ago,\" Merkel said. \"Today we have fake sites, bots, trolls — things that regenerate themselves, reinforcing opinions with certain algorithms and we have to learn to deal with them.\"\n“Opinions aren't formed the way they were 25 years ago.” Donald Trump’s victory in this month’s presidential elections has sparked a debate over the role that fake news played in the US campaign, with some critics saying that Facebook and Twitter should do more to curb misinformation on its platforms. Facebook and Google this month announced that they will exclude fake news sites from their ad networks, while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that the social network is taking steps to limit the spread of misinformation online.\nMerkel’s center-right party is expected to win next year’s national elections, though the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has gained momentum amid a nationalist backlash to the chancellor’s open-door refugee policy. As Reuters reports , the AfD is also outperforming both Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) on Facebook; the AfD has more than 300,000 likes on the social network, compared to 240,000 likes for the CDU and the SPD combined.\nBreitbart News , the website that became a major platform for the alt-right movement in the US, announced this month that it plans to launch in both Germany and France, which is also holding presidential elections in 2017. The website, which regularly publishes racist, sexist, and xenophobic articles, has said it wants to support far-right candidates in each election in the hopes of engineering another Trump-like upset.\nGerman officials have sharply criticized Facebook for failing to police hate speech on its platform over the past year. Last week, Justice Minister Heiko Maas said that the social network should be treated as a media company, which would make it accountable for any content published to its platform.",

(Photo: Denish Ochieng/ Standard) \nCORD leader Raila Odinga emerged from a Luo traditional shrine armed with cultural war regalia and declared that his quest to remove Jubilee Party from power was unstoppable. \nDressed in a cow skin, a traditional headgear and armed with a two-headed spear and shield, a confident Raila yesterday assured his supporters across the country that he will put up a strong fight against President Uhuru Kenyatta and deliver victory this time round. \nEnergised by the rare ceremony at the sacred Got Ramogi Hills in Bondo, just a few kilometers from his Opoda home, Raila declared he was ready to do battle for the Presidency. \n“I want to assure opposition supporters and those who want a change of guard in this country that I am more than ready for this political battle,” said Raila, under the watchful eyes of the elders. \n“I have received blessings and tools of war that will enable me face the battle with a lot of courage. I will not disappoint you,” he said of the two-headed spear, sharpened on two traditional stones. \nMumias woes Leaders hit out at Governor Wa Iria as Jamleck unveils county manifesto \nHe also refuted claims that he is responsible for collapse of Mumias Sugar Company. Raila said Jubilee leaders calling for him to explain the whereabouts of the money are merely on a name-smearing campaign. \nSpeaking at Siungu beach in Bondo Sub-county during the closing of a three-day Ramogi Cultural Festival and Reunion, a few hours after he had been installed as a warrior at Got Ramogi, the CORD leader told the government to be responsible of their woes. \nJubilee leaders, especially some MPs from the Mumias sugar belt, have claimed Raila owes the mill Sh300 million. But the former Prime Minister maintained that he does not owe the company a single cent and challenged the government to table evidence. \nHe said he will not be cowed by the Jubilee’s propaganda to muzzle him over corruption claims in the government. \n“Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto have realised that they have failed in addressing the issues affecting this country and they have instead turned to blaming others,” he said. \nRaila, who is in discussion with his CORD co-principals Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya) over who among them should fly the opposition ticket, said he now needs the support of all Kenyans “who have been demanding for a better country through the ballot.” \nSaid the former Prime Minister: “This is not a Luo battle and I am calling everyone to walk with me as we go into one of the major political battles.” \n“Do not let me walk alone into enemy territory. You have picked me to lead you into this war and with your backing, I storm fearlessly into the enemy lines,” he said. \nRaila said time was ripe for a regime change and asked Kenyans who had not registered as voters to do so as a matter of urgency. \n“Without the voting card, we will not win the war. Let everyone prepare,” he said. \nOn Friday evening, Raila addressed a group of youth in Kisumu town, urging them to ensure all those aged 18 and above register as voters. \nThe CORD leader said he will not relent in his war against corruption, saying Kenyans were not getting desired services because of wanton pilferage of state resources through cartels.

    "text": "Story highlights Will Obama weigh in publicly on Democrats' leadership battle? Schumer plans to fight repeal of Obamacare, privatizing Medicare Washington (CNN) Leadership battles within the Democratic Party. The fight over repealing Obamacare. And the story of an awkward hallway scramble two decades ago involving Al Gore and Fidel Castro.\nIt's all part of our weekly \"Inside Politics\" forecast, where you get next week's headlines today. 1. A giant test for Pelosi House Democrats pick their leadership team this week, and while Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi remains a prohibitive favorite, there is more drama than usual because of discontent over the presidential election and calls for fresh stewardship. Her rival is a congressman she once mentored, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who says he remains a huge Pelosi fan but that it is time for new leadership. JUST WATCHED Tim Ryan to challenge Nancy Pelosi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTim Ryan to challenge Nancy Pelosi 01:46 Read More CNN's Manu Raju shared some insights on the process that will culminate with a secret ballot later in the week. \"She's taking steps to reassure skeptics that she is listening to them, bringing in new voices into the leadership team and also telling these top rank-and-file members that they will have more of a platform on the committees to voice their positions,\" said Raju. \"What they want to hear is a concrete plan for the Democrats to regain the House majority, not necessarily by 2018 but by 2020.\" 2. Schumer girds for battle over healthcare There is a new leader on the Democratic side in the Senate -- New York's Chuck Schumer -- and he is raring to battle the Trump White House and congressional Republicans on two big health care issues. One is the President-elect's promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The other is House Speaker Paul Ryan's plan to privatize Medicare. JUST WATCHED Paul Ryan: We'll replace Obamacare with better option Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nPaul Ryan: We'll replace Obamacare with better option 01:11 Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post recently interviewed Schumer and shared some of the new leader's thinking on how Democrats will push back against GOP healthcare reforms. \"He says, 'Think about all of the good things in this law that they don't want to take away.' They are preparing to highlight that over the course of the next few months,\" O'Keefe said. \"The idea that 20 million people are covered, that women have more protection and coverage than they ever did before, that younger people can stay on their parents plans -- he (Schumer) says Republicans will rue the day that they decided to try to repeal Obamacare.\" 3. Will Obama weigh in on DNC chief? One recurring criticism of President Obama from fellow Democrats these past eight years is that he hasn't shown much interest in the nitty-gritty work of the Democratic National Committee. But as Obama prepares to move out of the White House, he and his team are taking an interest in the race to pick a new DNC chief -- adding a new wrinkle to what already was a tense debate among Democrats. Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison has the backing of influential voices like Schumer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. But team Obama reportedly believes Labor Secretary Tom Perez or former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm would be better choices. JUST WATCHED Sanders: Ellison is 'the candidate we need' for DNC Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nSanders: Ellison is 'the candidate we need' for DNC 03:27 Lisa Lerer of the Associated Press waded through some of the Obama White House's calculations. \"One person everyone is watching, of course, is President Obama,\" said Lerer. \"The big question is whether he gets involved. It's unclear whether the White House will go from behind-the-scenes whispers to a public position that will certainly influence where this goes.\" 4. GOP governors could face backlash Repealing and replacing Obamacare isn't just a big debate in Washington. It's also being watched closely in state capitals, including those with Republican governors. Many of them reduced the rolls of the uninsured by taking advantage of a Medicaid expansion included in the health care law. CNN's Nia Malika Henderson noted the governors could face a political backlash if major changes are enacted. JUST WATCHED How quickly will Congress repeal Obamacare? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nHow quickly will Congress repeal Obamacare? 01:34 \"If you look at the expansion of Medicaid particularly, that's covered about 15 million people roughly. About 10 governors ... Republican governors, have this expansion of Medicaid in their state,\" said Henderson. \"They are looking to be very involved in terms what this repeal -- and particularly the replace -- is going to look like, because they are on the front lines of these folks in their states who have the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\" 5. Al Gore's awkward encounter The death of Fidel Castro stirred a memory of a long-ago encounter that was part comedy and part trouble. It was in May 1994, at the historic inauguration of Nelson Mandela as President of South Africa. Vice President Al Gore led the U.S. delegation, which also included then First Lady Hillary Clinton. A Who's Who of world leaders were on hand, including Cuba's Fidel Castro. JUST WATCHED Crowds cheer Castro's death in Miami Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nCrowds cheer Castro's death in Miami 02:04 At one point before the ceremony, Gore and Castro ended up in the same hallway of the parliament building, and the Cuban leader seemed determined to get in a quick hello. But it was considered taboo, of course, for a US leader to have any dealings with Castro, so the Vice President and his Secret Service detail took a zig-zag path to avoid any contact with him. Two young White House staffers were later reprimanded, however, when word surfaced they took the opportunity to pose for a photograph with Castro, who was smiling as he mingled with other dignitaries in his trademark military uniform.",

    "text": "Premier League Championship Scottish Premiership Man Utd Uncovered: Jose Mourinho still searching for final piece of puzzle at Old Trafford THERE ARE two things that would be guaranteed to put a smile back on Jose Mourinho’s face: a few goals and a run of wins. PUBLISHED: 13:28, Tue, Nov 29, 2016 | UPDATED: 13:48, Tue, Nov 29, 2016 A lot of nonsense has been spoken about Mourinho not being happy at Manchester United . What manager would be smiling after presiding over the club’s worst start to a League season for 27 years. But Mourinho’s mood has nothing to do with living away from his family in a Manchester hotel, it has nothing to do with not wanting to be in the job and it is not even to do with being unhappy with the squad he inherited. It is entirely down to not achieving the results he believes United have deserved. And that has been because of their failure to turn their undoubted superiority into wins, particularly in the frustrating home draws against Stoke, Burnley, Arsenal and West Ham. Three goals in those games is a poor return for the amount of dominance exerted and chances created. Surprisingly, United’s total of 18 goals in their first 13 games is not their lowest at this stage of a season in the Premier League era. GETTY Jose Mourinho has endured a difficult start to life at Manchester United They had only 14 in both 1992-93 and 2004-05 and 17 in 2002-03. Strangely, they won the title in two of those three seasons but that is certainly looking a long shot this term, given they are already 11 points behind Chelsea and 10 adrift of Liverpool, neither of whom have European commitments. Mourinho has urged his players not to let their heads drop at the run of frustrating home draws. In his programme notes for Sunda's game he wrote: “We just have to keep doing what we think is right and hope our luck turns. “The results are frustrating but I hope everybody can see the improvement in our play and appreciate that we are moving in the right way. “The boys are playing with better balance, mentality, tempo, creativity – all that is missing are the results and sometimes in football you just cannot control the result no matter how well you play.” GETTY United will be keeping a close eye on Harry Kane's contract situation at Tottenham Mourinho’s problem is that he has two vastly experienced strikers, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney, who are no longer at the peak of their powers and two youngsters, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford who appear to be experiencing football’s second season syndrome. United could do with a striker at his peak in his mid-to-late 20s. And they will surely be keeping a close eye on Harry Kane's contract talks with Tottenham. Martial has been a shadow of the player who was United’s leading scorer last season with 17 following his £36m move from Monaco. He has only managed two this season – one of them a penalty – and has not even made the bench in the last two games. Last season’s 50-plus game schedule for club and country took a toll and maybe so have his personal problems, with his partner and daughter moving back to France. Mourinho has also suggested Martial has struggled to come to terms with his style of play after flourishing under Louis Van Gaal. Rashford has not scored since the win over Leicester two months ago and missed the sort of chance against West Ham on Sunday he would have put away with his eyes shut last season. Teams are far more wary of him after last season’s exploits and defenders are ‘doubling up’ on him. The huge talent possessed by Martial and Rashford means they will return to their best in time - but time is not on United’s side in the Premier League. The title may already be out of reach and if they do not start winning games soon the top four and a place in the Champions League could be beyond them too. GETTY Paul Pogba will be suspended for United's EFL Cup quarter-final tie with West Ham The suspensions that will rule Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini out of tomorrow’s quick re-union with Hammers in a League Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford have increased Mourinho’s problems. Pogba’s absence is a real blow because in recent games he has started to show on a consistent basis the quality that has made him the world’s most expensive player. And Fellaini is always useful, if only to throw on as a late substitute to unsettle a packed opposition defence. Mourinho has been encouraged that Henrikh Mkhitaryan has looked a real threat in his two appearances – from the start against Feyenoord and as a second half substitute on Sunday when he hit the post. Wayne Rooney has also looked in sharper form and both should start tomorrow. Another boost is that the talismanic Michael Carrick is set to return after missing the Hammers game. This time last year United were also struggling to score under Louis Van Gaal when they managed only three in a run of six home games – with turgid goal-less draws against Middlesbrough, Manchester City, PSV Eindhoven and West Ham punctuated by a 1-0 win over CSKA Moscow and a 2-0 victory over West Brom. The big difference now is that there much more pace, creativity and tempo to United’s attacking play. Only the final product is missing. Mourinho is praying it comes tomorrow. Related articles",

However, those laws are intended to prevent minorities from converting members of the majority Hindu community. Christians in India have protested the legislation, saying it seeks to stop evangelism and also make it difficult for people to convert to another religion even if it they are doing so voluntarily.

    "text": "Long reads, analysis and behind-the-scenes stories from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and selected contributors. 20 hrs ago Poppy Wallace with Prep students Abby and Lucy. Picture: Harriet Tatham Meet the man with 1,000 ‘grandchildren’ While most people become grandparents one child at a time, Ross Wallace gained hundreds of grandchildren in a matter of hours. By Harriet Tatham Mr Wallace, more commonly known as Poppy Wallace, was adopted as Whitsunday Anglican School’s grandfather 15 years ago, as a part of their Prep Poppy Program. “I’d finished work and I happened to be talking to a friend, and I said to her, ‘I’m retired, I don’t know what I’m going to do, I don’t have any grandchildren’,” he said. “She said, ‘Well, why don’t you come to Whitsunday School and be the poppy there?’.” It was not an idea Mr Wallace initially jumped at. “I kept making excuses for the whole year and then in 2002, she rang and said ‘School starts tomorrow and I’m picking you up’ and I’ve been here ever since,” he said. The Prep Poppy Program is designed to bring young and old together — for friendship, guidance and storytelling. “I come into the classroom with the pre-schoolers and become involved with whatever they are doing,” Mr Wallace said. “If they are writing, I assist with the writing; if they are reading, I become involved.” While he is not a teacher, Mr Wallace is also given the opportunity to speak about some of his interests with the five and six-year-olds. “I am given a bit of time to talk to them, and I quite often bring things along and talk about insects, plants, rocks and stones, and fish and animals — all the things of nature,” he said. Mr Wallace helps out with colouring-in. Picture: Harriet Tatham Aside from learning, the program also helps to introduce the students to elderly people — something Mr Wallace said children often missed out on. “A lot of them don’t have grandparents for varying reasons, and some of them have grandparents who are a long way away, and I suppose I can fill the role there a little bit.” “I would never be as valuable as their real grandparents, naturally, because they are extremely important and special and I would never pretend to be, but I do get involved sometimes in little things. “I have young people coming to show me where their tooth fell out or where they’ve cut their knee. I tie shoelaces and I wipe tears for the pre-schoolers.” A ‘step-in’ grandfather Year 11 student Brittany Masters has been a ‘grandchild’ of Mr Wallace for more than a decade, and said having a grandfather around was vitally important because it was something she missed out on at home. “For me it was awesome because my grandfather lives far away, so I’m not very close to him, I don’t get to see him much,” she said. “Poppy Wallace was an awesome step-in grandfather.” These Year 11 students remember Poppy Wallace reading to them when they were five-year-olds. Picture: Harriet Tatham Educational benefits from program Aside from the intergenerational friendships that have developed, Prep teacher Shirley Wood said having a grandfather in her classroom had helped with education outcomes. “It’s a social interaction to start, and it’s a chance for Poppy Wallace to talk about the good old days in our curriculum of history,” Ms Wood said. “Poppy talks about good manners, helping people, all those sorts of things, and the children seem to really respect him.” Ms Wood said it was a scheme she hoped other schools would look to introduce. “I wish more schools would probably do it. It’s hard to get that commitment from people, but well worth it,” she said. Poppy Wallace enjoys helping the students with reading. Picture: Harriet Tatham ",

Mon, 28/11/2016 - 2:31pm \nPAP started believing its own propaganda years ago and this had led to Lee Kuan Yew proclaiming Singapore’s ability to punch above its own weight. Feel good factor to many blur sotongs but the fact remains: \nA small country = a small country. Singapore has to tread extremely carefully, cannot afford to be a loose cannon like some ex NMP. \nAlthough PAP has access to hundreds of billions from our CPF and reserves, we must remember that money can only buy fair-weather friends. \nIt was not the ability to punch above our weight that produced a ‘vibrant’ economy as LKY claimed: it was at the expense of locals whose wages have been depressed, retirees who cannot retire even uncomfortably, elderly slogging till their last breath, massive infrastructure screw ups, etc. LKY was merely talking cock and the MSM was rope in to magnify PAP’s echo chamber. \nThe echo chamber effect has convinced PAP elites that it is their birthright to shoot from the hip, never mind not only what peasants think but even superpowers. Advertisement \nAnd so our PM has started to lecture superpowers as if there are no consequences. PM Lee not only stepped on China’s toes but congratulated Donald Trump in a manner unbefitting a head of state link. Still buay song, his lecture continued after the APEC summit. link Who’s next? Which country needs unsolicited advice from Singaporean aristocrats? \nPAP elites have to be mindful because other countries are watching and may respond at the opportune moment. And it appears one such moment has arrived – Singapore just kena punched from China all because PM Lee couldn’t control his gap. \nWhen will China return the nine Terrex Infantry Carrier Vehicles? link Will China make us go down on our knees?. \nChina is one country which PAP should not play play. China is a much bigger of PAP: PAP only draws the rules in our country but China does it on the global stage and has already rejected the international tribunal’s ruling in the South China Sea dispute. \nIf international ruling could be ignored, domestic legislations could also be rewritten. Besides the confiscation of our military equipment, what’s more at risk is the more than $100 billion of our reserves – including CPF funds – which have been invested in China. \nWill China bully Singapore the way PAP bullies citizens? Will PAP be bitten by the bitch Karma? \nOur aristocrats should bear in mind that they should not treat superpowers as if they are docile Singaporeans who are easy to makan. \n‘If you don’t talk, nobody says you are dumb’ was my mother’s advice decades ago. If Diplomacy for Idiots is demeaning to our scholars, then perhaps they should heed my mother’s advice. 9 Terrex vehicles and billions of our reserves are now at risk. \nSingapore must tread very carefully, don’t anyhow trumpet our ‘success’ because of self inflated wealth, don’t kaypoh in other’s affairs and there’s no need to lecture much more powerful countries. Or we risk getting punched again. Source:",

Ahead of its release, Donald Glover has announced his 11-track LP will be offered on a format that hardly anyone knew was a thing: “virtual reality vinyl.” \nAccording to Gambino’s website, the limited-edition offering will spread across two 45 RPM heavyweight 12” vinyl records. The order also includes a poster and digital downloads of previously released singles “ Me and Your Mama ” and “ Redbone .” The package is currently priced at $59.99, but that’s subject to change as its contents are finalized. \nIt’s not clear what “virtual reality vinyl” actually means, or how it will incorporate VR technology. But both “Mama” and “Redbone” clearly signaled that Gambino was headed down a more experimental route, and it looks like he’s carrying that over into how he wants fans to experience his music. \nContinuing the VR theme, Gambino also sent out a mysterious tweet late last night (November 29) directing fans to his PHAROS Earth app . The app has been updated with VR concert footage of him performing the funky, rap-less “Me and Your Mama” at his PHAROS event in Joshua Tree back in September. The video is available on both iPhone and Android, and can be viewed from a full 360-degree perspective, so you can spin around to see the stage, the crowd, the sky... anything, really.

    "text": "Erich Bloch, an electrical engineer who helped usher in the era of modern computing during three decades with IBM, and who later directed hundreds of millions of federal dollars toward scientific and technological innovation as director of the National Science Foundation in the 1980s, died Nov. 25 at his home in Washington. He was 91.\nThe cause was complications from Alzheimer’s disease, said his daughter, Rebecca Rosen.\nThe only child in a German-Jewish family, Mr. Bloch was orphaned during the Holocaust, survived the war years in Switzerland at a home for young refugees, and immigrated to the United States in 1948. He put himself through night school while pumping gas and cleaning laboratory equipment.\nIn 1952, he joined IBM in New York, where he established himself as a preeminent engineer in computing — and where he sharpened a competitive streak that he took to the sometimes fusty halls of government. As NSF director from 1984 to 1990, Mr. Bloch was credited with transforming the agency from a benefactor mainly of pure research into an engine of practical advancement.\nHe “changed NSF’s image,” Science magazine writers Joseph Palca and Eliot Marshall observed when Mr. Bloch left office, “from that of a mother hen for a brood of academic scientists to an agency with a plan for improving the nation.”\nMr. Bloch, displays a TCM, or thermal conduction module, circa 1980. (Courtesy of IBM) Mr. Bloch was the first NSF director to come from a business rather than academic background and the first without a doctoral degree. His qualifications lay in his achievements at IBM, where he helped mastermind revolutionary developments in computing.\nHe was chief engineer of the company’s “Stretch” supercomputer, so named because it stretched what were then the limits of computing. Introduced in 1961 with a $10 million price tag, it was used initially by the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the National Security Agency and was the most powerful computer at the time.\nLater that decade, Mr. Bloch helped develop the IBM System/360, a family of models that are the ancestors of today’s mainframes. Fred Brooks, one of two IBM colleagues who shared with Mr. Bloch a 1985 National Medal of Technology and Innovation, credited Mr. Bloch with managing the development of the computer’s processing chips, called Solid Logic Technology.\nThomas J. Watson Jr., who led IBM at the time, is widely regarded as having “bet the company” on Mr. Bloch, his colleagues and System/360 project, which cost $5 billion — twice the company’s annual revenue. It became, according to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., the “ most successful computer system of all time .”\n“These were really the Apollo astronauts of the computing field,” John C. Hollar, the president and chief executive of the museum, said in an interview. “They were doing things that no one had ever attempted to do before.”\nMr. Bloch’s experience at IBM informed his philosophy at NSF, a federal agency that is the government’s chief funder of non-medical scientific research. His goal, he told the publication Science in 1985, was to make sure “that our own infrastructure and research is the best in the world,” capable of competing with Europe, Japan and other markets.\n“A lot of people are upset about that kind of approach to life. They say science is international, so who cares who does it,” he remarked.“I say science is no more international than commerce is. . . . I think it’s a highly competitive field, I don’t apologize for it.”\nBill Harris, who served at NSF as assistant director for math and physical sciences, credited the approach with saving the NSF from possible elimination during federal belt-tightening. Mr. Bloch persuaded Reagan administration officials not only to spare it, but even to increase its budget.\nUnder Mr. Bloch, the NSF emphasized fields such as computer science, engineering and biotechnology. He oversaw the creation of NSFNET, a precursor to the modern Internet, and the establishment at universities of Engineering Research Centers as well as Science and Technology Centers — long-term collaborations among the public, private and academic sectors to tackle complex matters such as laser applications and earthquake prediction and engineering.\n“The single investigator can’t do it with a Bunsen burner,” he told Science in 1986.\nMr. Bloch’s admirers regarded him as a powerful advocate for results in a bureaucracy that tended toward inertia. Some detractors saw him as insufficiently attentive to individual researchers pursuing questions of pure science. But, in his view, scientists “have no inalienable right to funding.”\n“If all that we are doing is the individual research grant approach to science, then I think this country is going down the drain,” he told Science. “Science is changing, the tools of science are changing. And that requires different approaches. Yeah, it will make some people nervous. Well, they don’t have to participate in it. But that doesn’t mean that the country doesn’t need that approach. It does need it. And it should have started earlier, in my opinion.”\nErich Bloch was born in Sulzburg, a town located in the Black Forest, on Jan. 9, 1925. His father, a businessman, and his mother, a homemaker, were deported by the Nazis and perished in the concentration camps.\n“I have been pretty much on my own my whole life,” he told the New York Times in 1987. “It wasn’t easy getting started. It took a certain amount of drive and aggressiveness. I learned very early I had to do things myself for something to get done.”\nMr. Bloch received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1952 before joining IBM, where he retired as vice president of technical personnel development.\nAt NSF, Mr. Bloch took particular interest in programs benefitting women, minorities, and the disabled in the sciences. After leaving office, he co-founded a consulting firm, the Washington Advisory Group. He was a member of the National Academy of Engineering, a fellow of the nonprofit Council on Competitiveness and a past board member of Motorola.\nHis wife of 56 years, the former Renee Stern, died in 2004. Survivors include his daughter, Rebecca Rosen of Trumbull, Conn.; two granddaughters; and two great-grandchildren.\nIn recent years, an interviewer from SUNY-Buffalo asked Mr. Bloch if, looking back on his career at NSF and beyond, he would have done anything differently.\n“No,” he replied . “I did what I thought at that time was important. Revisiting that now and coming to a different conclusion is not very helpful to anyone, especially oneself. You live a life only once. You don’t live it twice. You do what you think is right at the time, and you stand on that.”\nRead more Washington Post obituaries",

Got it By Michael Schulson November 30 at 6:00 AM Darrell Scott, senior pastor of New Spirit Revival Center Ministries, speaks during the third day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland on July 20, 2016. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) \nThe election of Donald Trump has lifted fringe ideologies, such as the alt-right, and little-known political figures, such as Trump’s immigration adviser Kris Kobach, to new levels of national prominence. \nIt has also elevated a group of evangelical Christian leaders and traditions that are often treated as marginal. Specifically, Trump’s victory has been an unlikely triumph for the prosperity gospel, as well as for a handful of prosperity-oriented preachers from the world of African American televangelism. \nThe president-elect identifies as a Presbyterian. But his rhetoric during the campaign often reflected the language of the prosperity gospel, a diffuse American Christian movement that links faith, positive thinking and material wealth into “the American religion of winning,” as journalist Jeff Sharlet described it this year. \nMore than once, Trump has cited the influence of minister Norman Vincent Peale, whose concept of positive thinking is a close relative of the prosperity gospel. And like prosperity gospel preachers, Trump made the appeal of his personal fortune central to his pitch. [ Why Donald Trump’s glitzy style attracts evangelical voters ] \nThe prosperity gospel is often associated with ostentatious fundraisers such as Oral Roberts, Joel Osteen and Creflo Dollar, the Atlanta megachurch pastor who tried to raise $65 million in 2015 to buy a private plane. \nThese nondenominational pastors rarely become involved in politics, and they do not wield the same institutional power as the more conventional leaders of major evangelical denominations. Perhaps because it has no single denominational structure, no clear leadership, and a stronger presence among less-educated Americans and people of color, the prosperity movement has often been treated as marginal. \nBradley Koch, a sociologist at Georgia College who has studied the demographics of prosperity gospel traditions, explained that “there is a dearth of data” about the movement, in part because of scholars “historically just not taking the prosperity movement seriously.” \nStill, the movement’s influence is significant. Surveys can be unreliable tools for gauging religious beliefs, but, according to Koch, about 5 percent of Americans seem to identify explicitly with the prosperity movement. Far more Americans, though — perhaps close to two-thirds — identify with at least some prosperity gospel teachings, such as the idea that God wants people to succeed financially. \n“They might not identify with the prosperity gospel, in the same way people don’t identify as Presbyterian, but they may identify with ideas that are central to these teachings,” Koch said. \n“There’s something in the air in American religion that has valorized business success, that has valorized wealth, and that has valorized quote-unquote language of vigor,” said Jonathan Walton, a professor and minister at Harvard and the author of a book about black televangelists and the prosperity gospel. That valorization is there “at the highest levels,” he said. “Not just Pentecostals, not just folks of color. I’m talking about mainstream Presbyterians, Methodists.” \nWalton said he was not surprised that more than four-fifths of white evangelicals voted for Trump, a twice-divorced candidate who boasted about committing sexual assault. “I think the same mistake that political theorists and political pollsters made in relationship to Donald Trump’s rise and success is the same mistake scholars of religion have made as it relates to the role of the prosperity gospel in American society,” Walton said. “They underestimated just how much at the center it is, versus it being something that’s marginalized or marginal.” \nTrump’s affinity for the language and style of the prosperity gospel is part of a larger end run around traditional evangelical authorities, many of whom see the prosperity gospel as a kind of heresy, and many of whom were hesitant to embrace Trump’s candidacy. \nNowhere is that end run more stark than in Trump’s informal spiritual Cabinet — a small group of pastors who helped him burnish his moral bona fides early in the campaign. The three most central of those pastors — Paula White, Mark Burns and Darrell Scott — all came from the prosperity gospel-infused world of black televangelism. Each spoke at the Republican National Convention, and Burns, in particular, was a high-profile, and often controversial, Trump surrogate during the campaign. \nScott oversees a church and radio ministry in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. Burns runs a Christian TV network out of a tiny studio in Easley, S.C. And White, a popular TV preacher, is the pastor of a megachurch in an Orlando suburb. \nWhite is not black, but she got her start under the tutelage of the black megachurch icon T.D. Jakes, had a breakout gig on BET, and continues to preach to largely African American crowds. She and Trump became friends after he saw her on television (“He is a fan of Christian television,” Burns said). \nWhite introduced Scott to Trump in 2011, when Trump asked her to organize a meeting with pastors when he was considering a presidential run. Scott and Trump’s counsel, Michael Cohen, became friends, and they organized a high-profile meeting between Trump and black pastors during the primaries last fall. They also introduced Burns, the South Carolina pastor, to Trump. \nIn interviews, Scott and Cohen insisted that Trump’s campaign had successfully reached African American voters (he won 8 percent of the African American vote), and Cohen said that, of the 100 black pastors invited to meet with Trump last year, 98 had filled out endorsement cards. Asked for a list of those 98, he refused, berated a reporter for wasting his time with frivolous requests, and then said that a list might be on the website of Trump’s National Diversity Coalition (it is not; in an interview with the National Review, Darrell Scott estimated that only 35 to 50 of the pastors filled out endorsement cards). \nAsked what members of his church think of his association with Trump, Scott said that “you always have those who take umbrage to it, who listen to CNN more than they listen to me.” \nRather than win over black Christian voters, Scott and Burns seem more likely to have helped assure white Christians that Trump is neither impious nor a racist, despite his history of racist comments. \nIn return, they — along with White — have received a national platform . Burns spoke gratefully about how the campaign had raised his profile. Trump “did not have to allow this black preacher from a small town in South Carolina to have those things, he did not have to do that,” he said before recalling, warmly, the day Trump had asked him to speak at the Republican convention. \n“I’m not sure if I’ll be doing anything for the inauguration,” he said. “I’m praying that I will.” \nMichael Schulson is a freelance journalist and an associate editor at Religion Dispatches, where he co-produces a section on science, religion, technology and ethics. \nWant more stories about faith?

Obviously, we hope it's something that the two parties can resolve themselves,\" Ban's spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at the daily press briefing here yesterday when asked about Modi's remarks on the Indus Water Treaty amid escalating tensions between the two nations. \n\nAddressing a rally in Punjab last week, Modi had said the waters of Sutlej, Beas and Ravi rivers that rightfully belong to India will be stopped from going waste in Pakistan and he will ensure that Indian farmers in India utilise it. \n\n\"Now, every drop of this water will be stopped and I will give that to farmers of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir and Indian farmers. I am committed to this,\" he had said. \n\nLast week, during a Security Council debate on water, peace and security, Ban had cited the Indus Water Treaty signed by India and Pakistan as well as other similar agreements \"as instruments promoting stability and peace\" and said \"shared water resources often generated cooperation\". \n\nDuring the debate, Pakistan's Ambassador to the UN Maleeha Lodhi had warned against use of water as instrument of coercion or war. \n\nShe had said the 1960 Indus Water Treaty is an example of what can be achieved through bilateral agreements but also a case study of what could wrong if such agreements are not honoured or threatened with abrogation by a state party. \n\nSeparately, Ban had also expressed deep concern last week over the deterioration of the situation along the Line of Control in Kashmir in recent days, saying he \"trusts\" India and Pakistan can find \"common ground\" and work towards a sustainable peace. \n\nThe UN Chief had called on all involved to prioritise the restoration of calm and stability in order to prevent any further escalation and loss of life. \n\nWhen asked during the briefing about Indian-Pakistan tensions at the border, Dujarric referred to Ban's remarks saying the increasing tensions over the Line of Control are of \"great concern to the Secretary-General\". \n ",

    "text": "Bluefields (Nicaragua) (AFP) - A fierce hurricane and a powerful offshore earthquake struck Central America at the same time Thursday, triggering emergency responses in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Costa Rica, and prayers among fearful populations. Hurricane Otto, a storm packing winds of 175 kilometers (110 miles) per hour hit first, plowing into Nicaragua's southern Caribbean coast.\nCommunities in that zone and in northern neighboring Costa Rica were evacuated ahead of it. There were no immediate reports of any deaths.\nJust an hour later came the earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.0 and located 120 kilometers off El Salvador in the Pacific Ocean, on the other side of the Central American isthmus. It was felt also in Nicaragua's capital Managua and in Costa Rica.\nWhile there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the temblor, El Salvador and Nicaragua issued a tsunami alert for their Pacific coasts, and El Salvador ordered all people in the zone to evacuate.\nThe double whammy was a dire test for a largely poor region generally lacking resources and preparedness for major disasters.\n- Hurricane -\nFaced with a hurricane and possible tsunami, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega on Thursday declared a national emergency -- a step Costa Rica had already taken ahead of Hurricane Otto.\nThe storm was expected to chew its way along a broad swath of territory on both sides of the Nicaragua-Costa Rica border into Friday, losing strength as it went.\nBut the US National Hurricane Center warned Otto's trailing rains \"will likely result in life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\"\nEarlier this week, the outer bands of the storm caused the deaths of four people in Panama.\nThe hurricane came ashore Thursday near San Juan de Nicaragua, also known as Greytown, south of the city of Bluefields and close to the Costa Rican border.\n\"The wind is very strong and it's raining a lot,\" a local resident, Aldrick Beckford, told AFP by telephone. \"We just saw neighbors' roofs collapse.\"\nA reporter for Nicaraguan state television in San Juan de Nicaragua described a \"difficult\" situation with brutal gusts. \"There are cables fallen, trees brought down,\" he told Channel 4 television.\nThe wind lifted off the roof of the town hall, which had been operating as an emergency coordination center.\nIn Bluefields, a city of 45,000 people, and elsewhere, panic-buying cleared shops of bottled water, battery-powered lamps and plastic bags. On Wednesday, hundreds crammed onto boats to flee, while others who remained hammered metal sheeting over windows.\n\"This is the first time a hurricane has hit here,\" said Faucia Pena, an inhabitant of Bluefields. \"We are asking God to end it or send it elsewhere. Everybody is afraid.\"\nBoth Nicaragua and Costa Rica closed schools, mobilized emergency crews and issued red alerts for areas across much of their territories for the hurricane.\nThey also carried out evacuations, though some residents in northern Costa Rica decided to stay put to guard against looters.\nOne woman who did evacuate her home near the village of Barra del Colorado, Teresa Romero, 52, told AFP that around 10 male locals had refused to leave. She was taking shelter in a church near the capital San Jose.\n\"Otto is the southernmost landfalling hurricane in Central America on record,\" the US hurricane center said.\nA previous, far-stronger hurricane, Matthew, devastated parts of southern Haiti early last month, killing 546 people and leaving nearly 175,000 homeless.\n- Offshore quake -\nThe strong earthquake on the other side of the region came as the hurricane was making its way west.\nIt occurred at a depth of 10.3 kilometers (6.4 miles), according to the US Geological Survey -- sufficiently shallow to spark fears in the Salvadoran government of a possible tsunami.\n\"All protection mechanisms have been activated under which we have started evacuations,\" the minister in charge of the emergency response, Aristides Valencia, said on state radio.\nOfficials were scrambling to evaluate the impact of the quake. The task was made more difficult because some telephone lines in the capital San Salvador were cut.\nPeople ran out of dozens of buildings in the city in panic, fearing aftershocks.",

    "text": "Get Ready! Parliament Debates Transgender Equality 24/11/2016 15:52 Rebecca Fox Senior IT leader in the private sector and patron of Sparkle, a trans charity. Spaces Images via Getty Images \nOn Thursday 1st December there is a Back Bench Debate in the Houses of Parliament on transgender equality. This debate was scheduled by the Backbench Business Committee following a representation from Maria Miller, Ruth Cadbury and Angela Crawley. \nOK, so you're not an MP but you do have an MP. Do you believe transgender equality is important? Then now is the time to make a difference. \nWe must keep trans issues in the press in a positive way and keep up constructive pressure on Parliament to deliver progressive change for Trans folk in this country. The good news is it's quick and easy to find and contact your MP online. \nTake Action \nIt's simple to make a difference, and it only takes a few minutes of your time. \n1) Locate your MP and their contact details. Find them at this link: \n2) Contact them, tell them about how important trans equality is and you'd like them to attend the debate, and we've suggested some points for them to raise below \"What Is Your Trans Equality Cause?\" \n3) Watch the debate live when it happens \n4) Contact your MP afterwards to follow up the debate and what action they took to improve the lives of trans people and their equality \nWhat Is Your Trans Equality Cause? \nThere are themes running within trans equality - many of which were raised by the Transgender Equality inquiry published in January and the government response in July. When it comes to parliament it is all about \"making legislation fit for purpose\". \n1) Gender Recognition Act \nDe-medicalising the process required to get a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). Currently this is medicalised and an anonymous \"closed door committee\" makes decisions on the gender identity of people who wish to change the gender on their birth certificate. It costs quite a lot of money to apply, married couples who wish to remain married must get divorced and remarried, and there is the \"spousal veto\" that can be enacted to stop the process altogether. The gender recognition process must be transparent, affordable and about the individual only - they are the only person who should be concerned with their gender. \n2) Recognising Non-binary People \nLegal recognition for people outside the gender binary. In its response to the Inquiry, the government recognised that non-binary people exist for the first time. This was historic, however they did not undertake to do anything other than keep under consideration issues faced by non-binary people. There must be a cradle to grave assessment of these issues leading to a legal category for people outside the gender binary. \n3) Equality Act - Updating Language \nRecognising that transgender people are not only people who are \"transsexual\" but anyone on the trans spectrum, including non-binary. The current protected characteristic of gender reassignment does not cover everyone. The law must cover everyone. The protected characteristic in the equality act should be updated to gender identity. \nUsing more inclusive language around trans people such as \"gender identity\" in legislation and policies is really important. No one should be discriminated against because of their \"gender identity\". Updating the Equality Act means better and unambiguous protection for all trans and non-binary people. \nThe government must provide a timetable for reviewing and reforming legislation within this Parliament \n4) Trans Prisoners \nNo trans prisoner should be housed in a prison that is not aligned to their gender identity. A failure to have a GRC is not a valid reason to put a trans woman in a male prison. Punish the crime, not the gender. There are trans prisoners in the wrong prisons TODAY. \n5) Education \nInitial teacher training needs to include Trans and gender issues. Education around trans people should be made compulsory in all schools as part of PHSE which must become statutory. \n6) Press and Media \nThe press and media should be held to account whenever they use hateful or inappropriate language about trans people. \n7) Health Care \nWaiting lists to attend assessment at the Gender Identity Clinic (GIC) are over 12 months, far out of line with government targets. GP's (General Practitioner, Primary Care) are not trained properly to refer trans people to GICs, when trans people present themselves to GP they are refused bridging hormones (trans women) - the education of GPs on trans issues needs to be improved. The waiting time at GICs are far too long, and communication between GICs and GPs very poor in many cases and patients are left confused and in limbo. In simple terms, demand far exceeds supply. This is unacceptable. \n8) Trans Young People \nThere is a significant rise in people identifying as trans when they are young. The ability to be more open and understand about gender variance in society means children and parents are talking more about it. Trans children with supporting parents are more likely to have significantly less mental health issues in later life if their gender identity is understood and supported as quickly as possible. There is just one, under resourced GIC for children. In addition, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) are poorly equipped to deal with trans children and their needs. A delay in diagnosis for trans children before puberty is life changing - blockers are effective but also reversible. \n\"Decisions are made by those who show up\" \nLinks",

He embodied the high ideals of a politician, a citizen and a patriot sincerely convinced of the rightness of the cause to which he dedicated his whole life. His memory will forever remain in the hearts of the citizens of Russia.”\nMikhail Gorbachev, f ormer leader of the Soviet Union: “Fidel stood up and strengthened his country during the harshest American blockade, when there was colossal pressure on him and he still took his country out of this blockade to a path of independent development. In the past years, even when Fidel Castro was not formally in power, his role in strengthening the country was huge.”\nJacob Zuma, president of South Africa: “President Castro identified with our struggle against apartheid. He inspired the Cuban people to join us in our own struggle against apartheid.”\nFrançois Hollande, president of France: “Fidel Castro was a towering figure of the 20th century. He incarnated the Cuban revolution, in both its hopes and subsequent disillusionments. France, which condemned human rights abuses in Cuba, had equally challenged the US embargo on Cuba , and France was glad to see the two countries re-establish dialogue and open ties between themselves.”\nEnrique Peña Nieto, president of Mexico: “I lament the passing of Fidel Castro Ruz, leader of the Cuban revolution and emblem of the 20th century. Fidel Castro was a friend of Mexico, promoter of a bilateral relationship based on respect, dialogue and solidarity.”\nNicolás Maduro, president of Venezuela: “To all the revolutionaries of the world, we have to continue his legacy and his flag of independence, of socialism, of homeland.”\nRafael Correa, president of Ecuador: “He was a great one. Fidel is dead. Long live Cuba! Long live Latin America!”\nNarendra Modi, prime minister of India: “Fidel Castro was one of the most iconic personalities of the 20th century. India mourns the loss of a great friend.”",

Source: 7News Police confirm one of Australia's most wanted terrorists on his way home \nThe announcement followed a New York Times report that so-called Islamic State group operative Neil Prakash had been caught by Turkish forces several weeks ago as he tried to enter their country from Syria. \n\"An individual we believe to be Neil Prakash has been arrested and detained in Turkey,\" a government spokesperson said in a statement. \n\"Prakash is subject to a formal extradition request from Australia.\" \nPrakash was a senior recruiter for Islamic State and has been linked to terror plots to kill Australians. \nIn May Prakash was reported dead by Canberra on advice from Washington that he had been killed in a US airstrike in northern Iraq. \nHowever, the Times said he was only wounded, not killed, in Mosul on April 29. \nPrakash, who is in his early twenties, left Australia in 2013. \nHe has been linked to a failed Melbourne plot to behead a police officer in April last year, as well as to an 18-year-old who was killed after stabbing two police officers in Melbourne in 2014. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has called Prakash the senior Australian operative in IS. \nReported to be of Indian, Fijian and Cambodian background, Prakash used the internet \"to promote the evil ideology\" of the jihadist group \"and recruit Australian men, women and children -- many of whom are either still in the conflict zone or dead. \n\"Prakash and others ruthlessly target and groom our children -- vulnerable children -- with hateful propaganda of terrorism which perverts the religion of Islam,\" Turnbull told parliament in May. \nKnown as Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, Prakash was reportedly on a list of high-value IS recruiters targeted by the US in drone attacks in Iraq. \nHe worked with an English-speaking cell trying to radicalise people in the West to fight for Islamic State. \nThe government statement said Canberra had worked with Ankara on Prakash's arrest and would collaborate further on the extradition process. \nThe arrest was \"the result of close collaboration between Australian and Turkish authorities,\" it said. \n\"We are conscious that this individual has been arrested by Turkish authorities and their processes need to be respected and allowed to be completed. \n\"Australia will collaborate closely with Turkish authorities...

I believe that it is greatly exaggerated but I admit that there are some parts of the process where perhaps we have been a bit unattentive.”\nThe restaurant had been using a computerised system to monitor food temperatures incorrectly, but fish and shellfish were always stored on ice regardless of the surrounding temperature, he added.\nThis year the Nordic edition of the Michelin Guide gave three stars to Geranium, but only two to Copenhagen’s celebrated Noma , which was named best restaurant in the world by Britain’s Restaurant magazine in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014.\nNoma too faced criticism from the Danish food safety regulator in 2013, when it was accused of not taking adequate action after a sick kitchen worker gave dozens of customers food poisoning.",

    "text": "Presented by: Atkins: Encarnacion makes Blue Jays better if deal is right \nToronto Blue Jays managing general Ross Atkins joins Prime Time Sports to talk about Edwin Encarnacion is still an option to be signed and much more. November 21, 2016, 8:35 PM Sportsnet Staff November 21, 2016, 8:35 PM \nWhen the Toronto Blue Jays signed Kendrys Morales to a three-year, $33-million deal earlier in the off-season, it appeared the Edwin Encarnacion era had come to an end. \nGeneral manager Ross Atkins isn’t so sure the door is closed. \nAtkins joined Bob McCown and Damien Cox on Prime Time Sports on Sportsnet 590 The Fan to talk about where the team stands with one of its most iconic sluggers. \n“We’re confident that we have the resources to add enough to be a very good major league baseball team,” he said Monday evening. “Edwin could still be a part of that.” \nWhen Morales was brought into the fold it appeared the presence of a full-time designated hitter would preclude Encarnacion's return given that the latter played primary DH over the last few seasons. It seemed unlikely a soon-to-be 34-year-old who had been DH-first in recent years would be signed to be an everyday first baseman through 2019 or longer. \nHowever, Atkins expressed optimism that Encarnacion could answer the call as an everyday fixture in the field, with Morales sprinkled in if necessary. \n“Absolutely we feel like Edwin can play first base every day,\" he said. \"We also feel like Kendrys Morales can play some first base. Is he going to go from zero to 100 and play every day? No.” \nOne factor rumoured to be slowing doing Encarnacion's free agency is the expiration of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement on Dec. 1. As it stands, teams don't know what the 2017 luxury tax will be and there is speculation that some of the big market teams haven't been willing to take on major contracts until they know where they stand. For his part, Atkins was not convinced the new CBA was making much of a difference in negotiations. \n“I don’t personally [think it will affect when he signs]. I really don’t,\" he said. \"There are a lot of people that are suggesting it does, but it’s hard to understand everyone’s motivations and understand ultimately what’s the most important thing to them.” \nUnsurprisingly, the Blue Jays GM stated that whether his three-time all-star returns will depend on whether the contract is manageable and fits within the club's overall plan. \n“We feel as though Edwin makes us better,\" Atkins said. \"If the deal is right and we can find a way to continue and build a team around him.” %2Fbaseball%2Fmlb%2Fatkins-encarnacion-makes-blue-jays-better-deal-right%2F",

    "text": "Clickbait, fake news and the power of feeling To battle fake news is to battle brain chemistry. Save Image credit: \nFake news has dominated post-election headlines, and important questions have been asked: Would Hillary have won had almost a million people not read that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump? (Probably not). Did Facebook take enough action to prevent fake news proliferating on its network? (Definitely not). But few have asked why these articles were so popular in the first place. Why were so many people duped into clicking these stories? \nEarlier this month, BuzzFeed News ' Craig Silverman analyzed engagement (likes, comments, shares, etc.) across Facebook and identified the most popular real and fake articles across three distinct periods: February to April, May to July and August to Election Day. \nWith this analysis, Silverman was able to show that the 20 most popular fake posts were \"engaged with\" (Facebook's term for likes, shares and so on) 8.71 million times in the lead up to the election, compared to just 2.97 million times in February to April. Mainstream news showed the opposite pattern: Starting at 12.4 million, and falling to 7.37 million in the final period -- 1.34 million less than the fake news. The overall number of engagements is fairly steady, too, suggesting that, at least to some extent, Facebook users were sharing fake news instead of real stories. \nLast year, a group of researchers from Brazil's Federal University of Minas Gerais and the Qatar Computing Research Institute, analyzed 70,000 articles from four major news organizations ( BBC News , Daily Mail , Reuters and The New York Times ) to measure the correlation between headline sentiment and popularity . Although results varied from publication to publication, the general finding was that the more extreme the emotion in a headline, the more likely it is to be clicked on. \nThis runs both ways, the group said: \"A headline has more chance to be successful if the sentiment expressed in its text is extreme, towards the positive or the negative side. Results suggest that neutral headlines are usually less attractive.\" You're more likely to click on a story that says \"This is the best\" or \"This is the worst\" than \"This is quite okay.\" \n\"A headline has more chance to be successful if the sentiment expressed in its text is extreme.\" \nCould sentiment analysis explain fake news' popularity? As Silverman made the statistics he gathered public , I asked the researchers to run the same dissection on all of the stories in the dataset. Their script uses multiple methods (including valence scoring) to determine the positivity (or negativity) of each word in a headline, before giving it a final \"sentiment score.\" \nThe scale we're using runs from -4 (negative) to +4 (positive). A few examples: Vox 's \"The smug style in American liberalism\" got a -1, while The Guardian 's \"Millions of ordinary Americans support Donald Trump. Here's why,\" is one of the more positive, scoring a +0.75. Few stories get higher or lower than a full point away from neural. Washington Post 's \"Max Lucado: Trump doesn't pass the decency test\" was one of the most extreme mainstream stories, scoring a. -1.37. \nThe key finding from the team's analysis was that, on average, the fake news headlines were more negative than the mainstream ones in each period. Of course, that just shows \"that fake news headlines contain more negative words in the title than real news,\" research scientist Haewoon Kwak told Engadget. \nInferring meaning from this requires some guesswork, and there are two possible explanations, according to Kwak. Either fake news writers are intentionally doing this for \"clickbait\" purposes, or they \"naturally use more negative words\" because of the topics they're writing about. An in-depth qualitative study might show which of the explanations is valid, but given the fake news writers were generally trying to make money from clicks , the former seems likely to be a driving factor. \nLooking across the three periods, something else becomes clear: The average sentiment of real news became slightly more negative (from -0.14 to -0.2) while fake news became more positive (from -0.4 to -0.23). \"This contradicts with our expectation that fake news became more aggressive over time,\" said Kwak. Look at the stories themselves, though, and you can see the problem with the sentiment analysis. The fake news headlines in the pre-election period are atypical. Unlike those of traditional news, these headlines are complex, long and often switch viewpoint. \nTake the fake story \"BREAKING: Hillary Clinton To Be Indicted... Your Prayers Have Been Answered.\" The first half of this headline is clearly negative, the second half, clearly positive. As the sentiment scoring ascribes an average for the entire headline, the story was given a +0.29 score. There are other examples of this: \"Thousands Of Fake Ballot Slips Found Marked For Hillary Clinton! TRUMP WAS RIGHT!\" Kwak explained that things like Trump endorsements \"could boost the sentiment score slightly to be positive.\" \nThis mixture -- very positive with very negative -- is something of an anomaly and would require a new method of sentiment analysis to really dig into. But, it would appear, it does make for a very clickable headline. Kwak also noted that the dataset mixes headlines about Trump and Clinton. \"If there were separate datasets for each candidate, it may bring a more interesting result.\" \nSentiment analysis can't be used to show whether news is true or false, but it does show the way headline writers, like marketers, manipulate our emotions to inspire us to click, like or share a story. “Headline writers manipulate our emotions to inspire us to click, like or share a story.” \nJonah Berger is a Wharton professor and the bestselling author of Contagious: Why Things Catch On , a book that attempts to unearth the science behind \"going viral.\" What makes an advertisement, a YouTube video or a tweet catch on? \nAccording to Berger, virality comes down STEPPS, a backronym of six ideals. There's Social currency (we share things that make us look good to those around us), Triggers (the nugget of a product or idea), Emotion (a message with an emotional component is more likely to be shared), Public (the more public something is, the more likely people will imitate it), Practical value (useful things get shared), and Stories (if you want to spread an idea, embed it within a narrative). A good piece of marketing will hit as many of the STEPPS as possible. \nLook at BuzzFeed News 's dataset -- with the assumption that these Trump-positive stories were shared by Trump supporters -- and you can see the fake news ticking every marketing box. You have a piece of breaking news that hasn't been reported elsewhere (Social currency, Practical), that's positive for Trump (Emotion, Stories), with the crux of the article in the headline (Triggers), all shared -- often by people they know -- on a trusted public forum (Public). \nBerger's findings differ slightly from Kwak's. \"People are more likely to share more positive content, in part because what people share is a signal,\" Berger told Engadget. \"Most people don't want to be seen as a Debbie downer, always sharing negative news.\" \nBuzzFeed News ' data isn't complete. We don't know if people were actively sharing stories, liking them, or commenting. The net result is the same, as Facebook will surface those comments and likes among a user's social circle, but the intention may not have been to share. \"Negativity may certainly drive clicks,\" said Berger. \"We pay attention to negative things, even if we don't share them. If it bleeds, it leads.\" \nIt could be that many people were simply reading these stories because they were there, and they seemed interesting. We interact with fake news in much the same way as real news, or advertising, then. The same things that make a news story too tantalizing to ignore, make people at least click on them. \n\"Clickbait\" is a term that, to me, originally meant a story with a misleading headline -- a click-bait and switch, as it were. It's now more difficult to define. Cataphoric headlines -- titles that refer to something within the article -- are now often branded as clickbait: \"You won't believe why police arrested this 102-year-old woman\" is a classic example while \"Nintendo's Super Mario Run for iPhone and iPad now has a release date and price\" is a more subtle take. They're withholding all or some of the news from the potential readers, in order to get them to click. \nMany of the fake stories highlighted by BuzzFeed News employ similar tactics. The top story in the lead-up to the election was \"Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President, Releases Statement.\" Much of the news is there, but the author has appended \"releases statement\" to the headline to ensure you click. Next is \"WikiLeaks CONFIRMS Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS... Then Drops Another BOMBSHELL!\" This follows the same pattern: valuable information up front, cataphora later. \nThe third-placed story, \"IT'S OVER: Hillary's ISIS Email Just Leaked & It's Worse Than Anyone Could Have Imagined\" is the most cataphoric, offering way more tease than information. Berger calls this a curiosity gap. \"It raises awareness of a gap in knowledge, where clicking on the link is the only way to solve the puzzle.\" \nPreposterous stories are inherently more clickable than believable ones. \nThis suggests that preposterous stories are inherently more clickable than believable ones. Perhaps that shouldn't be a surprise. Humans are easily manipulated: With only a meager understanding of our psychology, politicians, journalists, marketers, filmmakers, authors and, yes, news scam artists, are able to make us think and feel pretty much whatever they want. \nApplying quantitative analysis to our actions feels dehumanizing, as no one wants to be told they don't have agency over their behavior. But in this case, it's important to do so. It's vital that Facebook, and other companies that have become the gateway to current events on the internet, understand how easy it is for our emotions to take over. \n\"Fake news is becoming a bigger and bigger issue,\" said Berger. \"But to solve it we can't blame people for being silly, dumb or biased. We have to understand why people click and share, and use that science to encourage people to engage with the important, true information.\" By Aaron Souppouris @AaronIsSocial Aaron writes about design, technology, video games, and whatever 'culture' is supposed to be.

Credit: AP/FOTOLIA   4:05pm \nY ou can glean a lot about a person from where they decide to go on holiday. Paris, for example, has long been synonymous with old romantics; Goa has a history of hippies; and the Costa-del-Sol has a well-documented association with on-the-run cons (hence its nickname, “Costa del Crime”). \nHowever, a new travel concept could change the way we think about people and the places they go. In fact, it could mean we don’t think about the places at all. \nKnown as the “mystery trip”, the concept is simple: travellers hand over their cash to an online travel agent, which then creates a surprise holiday for them based on their interests. The traveller is then instructed to turn up at an airport, station or port, where they open an envelope that explains where they will be going and what they will be doing there. You can glean a lot about a person from where they decide to go on holiday Credit: ALAMY \nIt’s a holiday for people who don’t like planning holidays. \nJubel is the latest company to jump on the mystery trip bandwagon and claims to offer “real adventure made easy”. The Californian start-up says its customers can decide how much or how little of their trip they want Jubel to plan. Mystery trips are holidays for people who don't like planning holidays \n“Your request can be as vague as ‘a completely blind journey somewhere in the world’, to something more specific, such as ‘a culturally rich Indonesian experience’,” claims Jubel’s website. \n“But it’s entirely up to you. However, one thing is for certain: the more that is left unknown, the more rewarding and thrilling your experience will be.” \nJubel is not the first company to offer mystery holidays. Earlier this year, the Pennsylvanian startup, Pack Up + Go, launched a similar concept; its travel agents specialise in planning surprise weekend trips for domestic US travellers. \n“Who says surprises are just for kids?” said Lillian Rafson, CEO, who describes Pack Up + Go as the “embodiment of open mindedness, spontaneity and excitement”. \nSo far the company has sent punters packing on dozens of themed holidays across the US, including gastronomic tours of Milwaukee, cycling trips in Vermont and road trips in Maine. \nThe cruise industry has also muzzled in on the act. As Telegraph Travel reported recently, the Bolsover Cruise Club is now offering voyage into the unknown : passengers hopping aboard its new 16-night Secret Sailaway excursion will be told nothing about the cruise except for the departure date and location. 10 UK holidays that will make you a better person \nCustomers will, however, have the chance to guess where they are going by deciphering a series of riddles. \n“Travelling is not as adventurous as it once was,” said Michael Wilson, the managing director of Bolsover Cruise Club. “This is our attempt to bring back some of the adventure, albeit with all the comforts of a luxury cruise.” The more that is left unknown, the more rewarding and thrilling your experience will be \nWilson may have a point - the golden age of discovery is now behind us - but are we really lacking the inspiration to plan our own holidays? Or are we just lacking the time? \nEither way, mystery trips offer a unique proposition for modern travellers. The question is: will they take off? A new cruise will take passengers on a voyage into the unknown Credit: AP/FOTOLIA \nBarely a year after launching, Mistrip, an early pioneer of secret holidays, already appears to have folded. Daniel Fahey, a destinations editor at Lonely Planet, went on an excursion with the company before it closed. \n“It was a little rough around the edges, and there were a number of activities that I wouldn’t have picked myself, but it satisfied the sloth-like sensibilities I tend to amass on holiday,” he said. Mystery trips offer a unique proposition for modern travellers. The question is: will they take off? \n“It also took me out of my comfort zone. Perhaps it leans a little too much on its novelty factor, but as an alternative to the endless ‘stack them high, let them fry’ all-inclusive deals you see elsewhere, it’s a great repackaging of the package holiday.” Watch | Top tips for finding a cheap flight 01:50",

    "text": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., blasted the Obama administration's decision on Tuesday to issue an export license allowing Airbus to sell more than 100 aircraft to Iran Air, in defiance of GOP warnings that Iran has a history of using these aircraft for military purposes.\n\"Only weeks after Iran was found to have violated the nuclear agreement, the Obama administration is yet again giving the Ayatollah more concessions,\" McCarthy said in response to the decision.\nHouse Republicans voted to ban these sales last week, but that was a symbolic gesture given the certainty that Obama would veto the bill if it ever reached his desk. There were reports that the administration was considering the licensing in order to \"fortify\" the Iran nuclear deal before President-elect Trump takes office, but the State Department insisted they were simply fulfilling American obligations under the terms of the deal, which is formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\"This particular license that we're talking about today isn't new,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said. \"There's no Machiavellian intent here to push, in any way, outside the bounds of our normal commitments and obligations here in the final months of the administration. What we are committed to doing is meeting our obligations in a consistent, forthright manner and this license [announced] today is one of those obligations.\"\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

President Obama 's team defended the sale of aircraft that would be used for \"exclusively civil end uses,\" in response to House legislation banning the transactions. \"We fully expect that, if these measures became law, our closest allies would view this bill as a violation of our JCPOA commitments and Iran would take the issue to the Joint Commission,\" a White House statement of administration policy said. \"Our allies have steadfastly supported us when Iran has brought concerns to the Joint Commission, but they would be unable to do so if this legislation were enacted.\"\nRep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., who has long opposed the Iran deal and discouraged Western companies from doing business with the Iranian government due to the regime's sponsorship of terrorism, maintained that the deal does not require the aircraft sales to go through.\n\"We should not be surprised to see Iran's latest military demonstrations feature Boeing 747s,\" Roskam told the Washington Free Beacon. \"This is not hypothetical ... We know the military has requisitioned Boeing planes from Iran Air in the past. Boeing is literally enhancing the military capabilities of the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.\"\nMcCarthy cited the licensing — and news that Iran recently stockpiled more of a particular nuclear material than is permissible under the nuclear deal — as a justification for considering withdrawal from the deal. \"The president's executive agreement with Iran is on unstable ground, and actions like this underscore the need for the upcoming Trump administration to review all options when it comes to this failed deal,\" he said.\nAfter emphasizing that \"there's no final push\" or \"concerted effort\" by the Obama administration to limit Trump's options, Kirby suggested that the next president's hands are tied already.\nAlso   Press fumes as Trump breaks tradition The press has bristled at the idea that the comings and goings in Trump Tower are being broadcast.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 11/23/16 12:01 AM \"Without speaking to what the next administration might or might not do, it's important to remember that this isn't a bilateral agreement between the United States and Iran,\" Kirby said. \"It is a multilateral international agreement and that character of it, the truly international scope of it, I think, needs to be taken into account.\"\nTop Story Can Trump be separated from Trump Inc.?   his business.\nBy Sarah Westwood • 11/23/16 12:01 AM Share  ",

Source: 7 News Plans to charge drivers based on distance travelled \nThe Government has commissioned a study into the benefits of cost-reflective road pricing for all vehicles, questioning the fairness of the existing system amid growing popularity of electric vehicles. \nBut trucks would be hit first, with a heavy vehicle road-charge flagged for within five years. \nInfrastructure Australia has asked the Government to bring in a road-user charge for light vehicles in the next decade but Urban Infrastructure Minister Paul Fletcher said any new tax on motorists would be a “10 to 15-year journey”. \nUnveiling the Government’s response to Infrastructure Australia’s 15-year plan yesterday, Malcolm Turnbull said it would adopt 69 of the 78 recommendations. \nThe Government will also work with State governments to develop urban rail plans for five of Australia’s major cities, including Perth. \nThe Prime Minister said an “eminent Australian” would be appointed to consider a more “sustainable and equitable” system of road pricing and funding. \nMr Fletcher said one of the main issues was fairness of the current system. \n“If you’re driving a 10-year-old Commodore, you’re paying through the fuel excise system the equivalent of 4.5¢ a kilometre, if you’re driving a Prius it’s about 1.5¢ a kilometre, if you’re driving a completely electric Tesla you’re not paying anything,” Mr Fletcher said. \nThe RAC and other motoring groups have long backed a road-user charge to replace the fuel excise and vehicle registration fees.

Science News Gut microbes contribute to recurrent 'yo-yo' obesity New research in mice may in the future help dieters keep the weight off Date: Weizmann Institute of Science Summary: Researchers have shown in mice that intestinal microbes -- collectively termed the gut microbiome -- play an unexpectedly important role in exacerbated post-dieting weight gain, and that this common phenomenon may in the future be prevented or treated by altering the composition or function of the microbiome. Share: Photo illustration of scale (stock image). Credit: © Karen Roach / Fotolia Photo illustration of scale (stock image). Credit: © Karen Roach / Fotolia Close Following a successful diet, many people are dismayed to find their weight rebounding -- an all-too-common phenomenon termed \"recurrent\" or \"yo-yo\" obesity. Worse still, the vast majority of recurrently obese individuals not only rebound to their pre-dieting weight but also gain more weight with each dieting cycle. During each round of dieting-and-weight-regain, their proportion of body fat increases, and so does the risk of developing the manifestations of metabolic syndrome, including adult-onset diabetes, fatty liver and other obesity-related diseases. \nAs reported today in Nature , researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science have shown in mice that intestinal microbes -- collectively termed the gut microbiome -- play an unexpectedly important role in exacerbated post-dieting weight gain, and that this common phenomenon may in the future be prevented or treated by altering the composition or function of the microbiome. \nThe study was performed by research teams headed by Dr. Eran Elinav of the Immunology Department and Prof. Eran Segal of the Computer Science and Applied Mathematics Department. The researchers found that after a cycle of gaining and losing weight, all the mice's body systems fully reverted to normal -- except the microbiome. For about six months after losing weight, post-obese mice retained an abnormal \"obese\" microbiome. \n\"We've shown in obese mice that following successful dieting and weight loss, the microbiome retains a 'memory' of previous obesity,\" says Elinav. \"This persistent microbiome accelerated the regaining of weight when the mice were put back on a high-calorie diet or ate regular food in excessive amounts.\" Segal elaborates: \"By conducting a detailed functional analysis of the microbiome, we've developed potential therapeutic approaches to alleviating its impact on weight regain.\" \nThe study was led by Christoph Thaiss, a Ph.D. student in Elinav's lab. Thaiss collaborated with master's student Shlomik Itav of the Elinav lab, Daphna Rothschild, a Ph.D. student of Segal's lab, as well as with other scientists from Weizmann and elsewhere. \nIn a series of experiments, the scientists demonstrated that the makeup of the \"obese\" microbiome was a major driver of accelerated post-dieting weight gain. For example, when the researchers depleted the intestinal microbes in mice by giving them broad-spectrum antibiotics, the exaggerated post-diet weight gain was eliminated. In another experiment, when intestinal microbes from mice with a history of obesity were introduced into germ-free mice (which, by definition, carry no microbiome of their own), their weight gain was accelerated upon feeding with a high-calorie diet, compared to germ-free mice that had received an implant of intestinal microbes from mice with no history of weight gain. \nNext, the scientists developed a machine-learning algorithm, based on hundreds of individualized microbiome parameters, which successfully and accurately predicted the rate of weight regain in each mouse, based on the characteristics of its microbiome after weight gain and successful dieting. Furthermore, by combining genomic and metabolic approaches, they then identified two molecules driving the impact of the microbiome on regaining weight. These molecules -- belonging to the class of organic chemicals called flavonoids that are obtained through eating certain vegetables -- are rapidly degraded by the \"post-dieting\" microbiome, so that the levels of these molecules in post-dieting mice are significantly lower than those in mice with no history of obesity. The researchers found that under normal circumstances, these two flavonoids promote energy expenditure during fat metabolism. Low levels of these flavonoids in weight cycling prevented this fat-derived energy release, causing the post-dieting mice to accumulate extra fat when they were returned to a high-calorie diet. \nFinally, the researchers used these insights to develop new proof-of-concept treatments for recurrent obesity. First, they implanted formerly obese mice with gut microbes from mice that had never been obese. This fecal microbiome transplantation erased the \"memory\" of obesity in these mice when they were re-exposed to a high-calorie diet, preventing excessive recurrent obesity. \nNext, the scientists used an approach that is likely to be more unobjectionable to humans: They supplemented post-dieting mice with flavonoids added to their drinking water. This brought their flavonoid levels, and thus their energy expenditure, back to normal levels. As a result, even on return to a high-calorie diet, the mice did not experience accelerated weight gain. Segal said: \"We call this approach 'post-biotic' intervention. In contrast to probiotics, which introduce helpful microbes into the intestines, we are not introducing the microbes themselves but substances affected by the microbiome, which might prove to be more safe and effective.\" \nRecurrent obesity is an epidemic of massive proportions, in every meaning of the word. \"Obesity affects nearly half of the world's adult population, and predisposes people to common life-risking complications such as adult-onset diabetes and heart disease,\" says Elinav. \"If the results of our mouse studies are found to be applicable to humans, they may help diagnose and treat recurrent obesity, and this, in turn, may help alleviate the obesity epidemic.\" \nAlso taking part in the study were Mariska Meijer, Maayan Levy, Claudia Moresi, Lenka Dohnalova, Sofia Braverman, Shachar Rozin, Dr. Mally Dori-Bachash and Staff Scientist Hagit Shapiro of the Immunology Department, Staff Scientists Drs.

    "text": "T he globalisation of labour and the rise of automation has led, according to the former chief economist of the World Bank, “a crisis in the global labour market”. But Professor Kaushik Basu, in Australia to give a lecture at the Monash Business School, argues that the push by Donald Trump and political parties in Australia towards greater protectionism is precisely the wrong path to take.\nInstead, governments need to focus more on distributing profits to workers.\nFor Basu, professor of economics and the C. Marks Professor of International Studies at Cornell University and former chief economic advisor to the Indian government, the time since the GFC has seen “one crisis after another” leading to a long period of economic stagnation. But among the biggest challenges economists and politicians have to face is that the increase of technology has spurred the globalisation of labour in a way never before encountered.\nAccording to Basu, the big change from previous technology increases has been the “sharp rise in technology that links workers in different places”. This means that wealthy nations are now able to access “cheap labour that was earlier tucked away in faraway places”.\nScott Morrison's mixed messages and his faith in a private sector that isn't investing | Greg Jericho Read more \nBasu notes that there is no doubt that the ability to outsource workers has improved world GDP and the standard of living for people in developing countries and thus should be celebrated. \nBut the problem is the “bottom end of labour” in rich countries like Australia, USA and the UK is now in direct competition with “workers in poorer countries who for the reason of being in poorer countries command a much lower wage”. \nBasu says that while poverty is improving in developing countries, this competition for labour “is causing inequality to get exacerbated” in wealthy countries.\nHe argues the crisis in the global labour market is “a slow crisis” as there is “never an event which makes news”, but that it is “feeding into a lot of economic and political problems and manifesting in different ways”. \nAnd for Basu, one of the most stark ways it is manifested is the declining share of national income going to workers.\nThis decline is something that has occurred across most developed nations since the mid-1970s, but the drop in Australia is among the most marked.\nIn 1975 two thirds of our GDP was in the form of wages; in 2014 it was just 53%:\nNot surprisingly such a shift has also seen real wages flatten, even while labour productivity improves:\nFor Basu, this highlights that the winners from globalised labour are not just the worker in the poor nations, but the “profit makers” in the wealthy ones. \nHe argues the solution to the dilemma of outsourcing and the replacement of work by automated processes is to not think of it as a “labour versus labour problem – workers in rich countries and workers in poor countries.” Instead he argues, “we have to face up to the fact that this is also a wage versus profit problem – with an increase in the share of profits, and a decrease in the share of wages.”\nOne of the problems with thinking of it as a labour versus labour problem is the solution quickly becomes one of protectionism. But for Basu, this would just be a case rich nations economically cutting off their nose to spite their face.\nThe problem is that outsourcing has actually been very good for economic growth in wealthy nations. The open economy in the USA of the 1980s and 1990s, he argues, allowed its economy to be much more flexible and thus able to best use its resources and could “surge ahead” while Japan which was largely protectionist, “slowed down”. \nHe argues that were the USA under Trump, or Australia under a protectionist trade policy, to block the outsourcing of labour it would look very good “at first sight” because it would seem like “you’re protecting jobs among your own workers in your own country”.\nBut he argues what would happen is that other nations would continue to use the cheap labour and would “out compete” the protectionist nation – hurting economic growth and hitting profit makers in that nation, and even more so, the workers. \nBasu is not an economist who only thinks in terms of GDP growth. \nEarlier this month , along with Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and three other former chief economists of the World Bank, he signed “the Stockholm Statement” which seeks to guide policymaking. \nThe first principle of the statement is that “GDP growth is not an end in itself”.\nBasu notes that too often those who argue in favour of reducing inequality and poverty do so by arguing that it “is actually good for GDP growth”. He argues however that while this is often the case, reducing inequality or poverty is “worthwhile as an end in itself even if it slices off a little of the GDP growth”.\nThus he argues the way to respond to the declining share of wages due to globalisation and automation is for both an open economy (which is good for GDP growth), but also that governments must “think of some form of redistribution so that workers get their income shored up.”\nTo this end, while not discounting the idea of a universal basic income, he argues “the time has come to allow workers to get a share of profits”.\nHe also argues that this redistribution of income should also “take the form of better services likes health and education.”\nFree trade is viewed as economic catnip, but the benefits are not for everyone | Greg Jericho Read more \nBasu argues this “doesn’t mean a need for a large government” but rather it means a need for “a redistributed government which takes away a slice from the rich and provides it to the workers in the form of health benefits education and also some form of profit share”. \nGlobalisation is not about to stop, and neither are the concerns of workers – especially as we are seeing in Australia a time of flat real wage growth and declining share of income going to workers. \nThis does not mean we need to cower and put up trade barriers which will only exacerbate the problems. But neither does this mean we can carry on still thinking only of GDP growth. To both improve our economy and also dampen the nationalistic xenophobia that quickly turns to racism, governments must adopt policy more targeted to inclusive growth. They must realise that with the greater flexibility of labour comes the need for greater emphasis on redistribution of income.\nFailure to do so will only see inequality increase and the fires of nationalism – and all the dangerous sparks associated with it – burn hotter.",

    "text": "Every company is a technology company, but most don’t behave like one Posted The startup school of hard knocks with Jason Goldberg at Disrupt London, Dec 5-6 S. Somasegar Crunch Network Contributor S. Somasegar is a venture partner at Madrona Venture Group and the former head of Microsoft’s Developer Division. More posts by this contributor: Daniel Li is an investor with Madrona Venture Group . More posts by this contributor: How to join the network \nIn 2011, Marc Andreesen famously wrote a Wall Street Journal essay declaring that “software is eating the world.” Five years later , the five largest companies in the world by market capitalization are all software companies. \nHowever, in today’s information economy, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook are not the only important large technology companies. \nAs technology becomes more and more pervasive across industries and functions, companies like Exxon, GE, Citi, and Walmart are all racing to become technology companies as well. \nToday, we are less interested in the distinction between technology and non-technology companies (because there are very few successful companies that are not technology companies). Instead, it’s more interesting to ask questions like – Tesla is a technology company rapidly learning to become an automobile company, and Ford is an automobile company rapidly learning to become a technology company – which one is going to get there first? \nIn short, software is eating the world, but software companies aren’t the only ones taking a bite. \nHow do companies in real estate, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, or other industries that have traditionally not been recognized as technology industries become technology companies? What are some of the key learnings that we see from startups and companies that are successfully making this transition? It starts at the highest level of leadership \nLeading a transformation to become a successful technology company is not a job that can simply be tasked to the CTO or CIO. The level of engagement and investment to lead a successful transformation requires the CEO and board of directors to not only be fully bought in but to be the main drivers of the change. \nGoldman Sachs has known for many years that technology is a key competitive advantage in financial services. In one recent WSJ article , a top Goldman executive valued a license for their risk measurement system at well over $1 billion, and possibly even up to $5 billion. They have since open-sourced the system in a move to attempt to drum up new business. \nMore importantly, however, Goldman Sachs’ Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein has repeatedly stated that “ Goldman Sachs is a technology firm ” and highlights the fact that Goldman Sachs actually employs more engineers than companies like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn and often competes for talent and wins against top internet companies. Talent is the most important asset of a technology company \nOne of the key drivers for the rapid growth of new technology companies is the low capital requirement to build a company today. New companies no longer need to buy hundreds of thousands of dollars of servers and equipment; instead, they can pay for servers on demand from cloud providers when needed. \nThis dynamic makes it more important than ever for companies to hire great people. In fact, a recent survey Madrona conducted in conjunction with its annual CIO Summit found that 89% of Fortune 500 CIOs say hiring top talent is their number one concern today. \nGE has likely made the largest investment in this space to change the story that young engineers and college graduates hear about the company with a series of Youtube videos and television ads. Though it remains to be seen whether these videos work, GE has recognized that filling its talent pipeline with young engineers and technologists is critical and is investing accordingly. Technology needs to be at the core of company culture, not an afterthought \nAt a company like Microsoft or Facebook, engineering positions are the most prestigious, highest status roles at the company. The founders and CEOs of technology companies are often engineers and may have even built early version of the products themselves. \nFor companies to successfully make the transition and become a technology company, cultures need to change to take into account the unique way that software development works and to highlight the importance of technology and the people who manage and build it. \nOne example of a move towards a developer friendly culture is happening at Walmart. WalmartLabs recently open sourced Electrode, the application platform that powers Walmart.com. Electrode is a modular platform that helps improve application performance, and Walmart is open sourcing the software to give back to the open source world and benefit from additional contributions from the community. \nIt is important to keep in mind that building a technology-driven culture is not just about free lunches and massages. As Joel Spolsky CEO of Stack Overflow said in a recent interview , “If you want to attract and keep developers, don’t emphasize ping-pong tables, lounges, fire pits and chocolate fountains. Give them private offices or let them work from home because this uninterrupted time to concentrate is the most important and scarcest commodity. Companies need to move fast and adopt agile practices \nThe pace of technology adoption is getting faster and faster every year. For example, it took decades for electricity and telephones to reach 50% of US households, but today it takes only years for new technologies like smartphones and tablets to reach a majority of the population. This underscores the importance for companies to continuously adopt new technologies that can enhance productivity and also to continuously experiment with new technologies that have the potential to be disruptive to the business. \nAn interesting anecdote from The Lean Startup , one of the manifestos for startup founders, is that Intuit holds themselves accountable to being innovative and agile by using two key metrics: (1) the number of customers using products that didn’t exist three years ago and (2) the percentage of revenue coming from offerings that did not exist three years ago. Historically for Intuit, it took a new product an average of 5.5 years to reach $50 million in revenue; at the time the book was written, they had multiple products generating $50 million in revenue that were less than a year old. \nParticularly, as the world is moving towards cloud computing, continuous development, and continuous updates are the name of the game. Agile development practices enable you to continuously deliver better experiences for your customers and waterfall development methodology is a relic of the past. Companies need to look forward and avoid getting caught in the innovator’s dilemma \nThe classic case for why legacy competitors can do everything “right” and fail is the force of disruptive innovation described in Clayton Christensen’s The Innovator’s Dilemma . Businesses can reject innovations based on customers’ current needs while innovative upstarts develop products in a way that meets customers’ future needs. Stratchery \n\nRecently, we have seen automakers take very innovative approaches to automotive technology as autonomous vehicles move to the front and center of the startup world with the acquisitions of companies like Otto and Cruise and public pilots of new technologies like Uber’s self-driving cars in Pittsburgh or Tesla’s Autopilot feature. \nFord, in particular, has been very vocal about the autonomous future and the importance of working differently in the context of today’s technology-driven world. Ford’s CEO, Mark Fields, has written that “As little as four years ago, our approach was aligned with the thinking of most automakers today, which is taking incremental steps to achieve full autonomy by advancing driver assist technology. This is not how we look at it today. We learned that to achieve full autonomy, we’d have to take a completely different pathway.” \nConclusion \nThe race to become the market leader across a variety of sectors and geographies is speeding up amongst older incumbents and promising, young startups. Startups have a lot to learn from the established management and financial practices of incumbents, but incumbents have a lot to learn from startups as well. The companies, young or old, that use technology to best create competitive advantages for themselves will win. \nTechnology needs to be a fundamental fabric of the company’s DNA and culture as companies truly internalize that “Every company is a technology company”. \nFeatured Image: Paper Boat Creative /Getty Images 0 ",

More A mother has denied giving her daughter drugs she referred to as Smarties so she could spend time with her dealer boyfriend, a court has heard.\nMichala Pyke, 37, texted then-partner John Rytting saying, ‘she can have a blue smartie [diazepam] and go to sleep lol xxx’.\nIt is alleged that the couple gave Pyke’s daughter Poppy Widdison sedatives to get her out of the way – Poppy later died.\nMORE: Elderly woman spotted sleeping in her car as Britain endures freezing weather\nWhat Poppy was told were ‘Smarties’ were allegedly actually the controlled tranquilliser diazepam.\nPolice found more than 770 diazepam pills at Rytting’s home in Grimsby, North East Lincs.\nHull Crown Court heard that Poppy Widdison died after suffering a cardiac arrest on June 10, 2013, but the death was described as “unexplained”.\nView photos\nPyke and Rytting pleaded guilty to causing Poppy emotional abuse [SWNS] More On June 9, Poppy was found by an ambulance crew unresponsive, turning blue and not breathing at Rytting’s property – she was taken to Sheffield Hospital, South Yorkshire, and her machine was turned off after the cardiac arrest.\nSamples taken from the youngster found by medical professionals showed that Poppy had ingested tranquillisers, as well as “dance drug” ketamine, heroin and methadone [a Heroin withdrawal drug].\nThe couple denied physical abuse of the child, and pleaded not guilty to making her ingest drugs – the jury were told Pyke had already pleaded guilty to causing Poppy emotional abuse by calling her “a little b*stard”.\nIn his opening remarks, prosecutor David Gordon told the jury, “Medical and scientific experts seem to agree that drugs did not contribute to Poppy’s death.\n“The prosecution would say that at the very least Pyke was an irresponsible parent.\n“Poppy was seen by Pyke as something of a nuisance or encumbrance because the couple wanted to get on with their love life and enjoy each other’s company.”\nMr Gordon also told the jury, “Tests found that Heroin and Methadone was also found in Poppy’s hair.\n“This is not like sprinkling of the drug over the child’s head – but was made up of the compound of her own cell structure.”\nView photos\nPyke makes her way into court [SWNS] More A series of texts were read out to the jury which contained messages from both Pyke and Rytting.\nPyke texted Rytting, who she had a seven month relationship with, to ask what he was doing.\nShe sent the message: “she can have a blue smartie [diazepam] and go to sleep lol xxx”\nRytting texted back: “you ok”\nPyke replied: “I have a bottle of wine if you want to share. I got £4 from mum so I can get you purple sourz [drugs]. Text me back babe.”\nPyke then text Rytting: “Get the blue smarties ready – the one she likes.”\nSpeaking about the set of text messages, Mr Gordon said: “It is interesting in the text we say, the prosecution, that this is a reference of diazepam or administrating drugs to sedate the child.\n“The words: ‘the one she likes’ suggests it is not a one off but a repeated course of conduct.\n“She [Pyke] regarded her own child as a nuisance and interfering with the enjoyment in her own relationship with Mr Rytting.\n“The texts reveal that Miss Pyke saw her daughter Poppy as a inconvenience who she felt was in the way with regards to her relationship with Mr Rytting.\n“The prosecution will show you [the jury] the physical and mental abuse which poppy suffered during this trial.\n“A neighbour who lived next door to where Miss Pyke was living called her own daughter ‘a little b*stard’ and the witness says saw marks of Poppy’s arms.\nRead More “That is just a flavour of the evidence which will be induced before you [jury] during the trial.”\nThe jury heard Pyke said she only smacked her daughter on the bottom and hands to discipline her.\nView photos\nRytting pictured outside court [SWNS] More The jury were told Rytting had already admitted fraudulently importing Temazepan before the trial and also pleaded guilty to possession to supply of tranquilliser controlled drugs.\nBoth Pyke and Rytting admitted the wilful neglect of a child under the age of 16 by allowing Poppy to be accommodated in a place where prescribed and controlled drugs were unsecured and in the presence and in reach of a child. Pyke has also pleaded guilty to causing Poppy emotional abuse.\nThe former couple each deny two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a child under the age of 16, namely Pyke’s daughter Poppy Widdison, and four drug charges.\nOne count involves encouraging her to digest prescription drugs diazepam and the other is physical abuse to cause four-year-old Poppy unnecessary suffering or to cause harm to her health.\nThe trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.\n* Comments on this story have been turned off for legal reasons *",

Rory Gilmore, paid a visit to The Tonight Show last night, where she and Jimmy Fallon tried to tip-toe around spoiling the final four words of the Gilmore Girls reboot (the cliffhanger-y ones that melted down the Internet). He did ask her if she knew them before shooting the scene, and she said yes. \"I did. Well, Amy [Sherman-Palladino, the showrunner] told me, and I was very shocked. She told me when she was putting together this reunion and uh yeah, no spoilers. No, I didn't know.

She tried really, really hard to hide her feelings about the direction the words take her character in but… Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most Popular Bledel was a little more open about her disappointment with where Rory went earlier in the show, at the end of season four (when Rory—spoiler—broke up with Jess and slept with a married Dean). \"I remember getting that script and thinking 'this is so out of character!' It's not a good move, clearly,\" she said. \"I think that they had created this character who was so seemingly perfect that they had to throw something at her, but I think we overcorrected. Clearly, we overcorrected, right? It was like 'WHOA, what happened here?'\" Bledel also dropped a casual Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants bombshell—that a reboot is something the girls (Bledel's real-life pals Blake Lively, Amber Tamblyn, and America Ferrera) are pushing for. \"I mean we would all love to do it…and we talk about it,\" she said. \"It would be so much fun. I think we should absolutely do it. We're working on it so we'll see if it happens.\" Please, please let it be.

In the now-viral video capturing the incident, a man stood up and started sounding off on his support of President-elect Donald Trump . “We are sorry to our customers who experienced this disruption,” the airlines said in a statement . We have followed up with the teams involved and all agree that this customer should not have been allowed to continue on the flight. Our responsibility for ensuring all customers feel safe and comfortable with Delta includes requiring civil behavior from everyone. “The behavior we see in this video does not square with our training or culture and follow up will continue so we can better ensure our employees will know they will be fully supported to make the right decisions when these issues arise.” The video shows a man wearing a hat and glasses clapping and yelling about his support for Trump. “Donald Trump baby!” the man yelled to the rest of the passengers, later adding, “We got some Hillary bitches on here? Come on, baby. Trump! That’s what I thought. That’s what I’m talking about.” RELATED VIDEO: Kanye West Booed at Concert After Saying He ‘Would Have Voted’ for Donald Trump: ‘Stop Focusing on Racism’ The man continued egging on the rest of the people aboard the flight, yelling, “Hey baby, Donald Trump! Is your president. Every goddamn one of yous. If you don’t like it, too bad.” The other passengers remained quiet throughout the man’s rant. The individual then took his seat, and the video taken by a fellow passenger has now been viewed on Facebook over 2 million times. This is not the first time the election has wreaked on-flight havoc. Earlier this month, a United Airlines captain settled a politically-charged “scuffle” with a heartfelt plea to his passengers aboard a flight from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta shortly after the election. The individual who posted the video claimed “an individual with a ‘plaid shirt and a camo cap’ said something racist (about being ‘glad to have kept his guns’) to an African American lady, and she began to cry and freak out.” Then the captain reached out to those aboard the flight. “I understand everybody has their opinions; that’s fine,” he said. “If you support him , great. If you don’t, I understand. However, we’re up here to go to Puerto Vallarta, supposed to be having a good time, and what I do ask is that as people we have the common decency to respect each other’s decisions and to get along … Nobody wants to argue, nobody’s gonna change their minds by arguing.” Reblog",

In typical new-media fashion, this announcement came in the form of a smug little tweet. \nhttps://twitter.com/netflix/status/803962377997688832 \nThe official website was updated shortly thereafter to give us some more information: Starting today, users on iOS and Android phones/tablets can, on certain movies and shows, download videos to watch later without an internet connection. As long as you have an account, and the latest version of the app, that's all you need. \nThis is something Netflix users have been asking for for many years now. The company has never exactly been fast to address its fans (except that one time they tried to stop doing DVDs altogether, remember that disaster? ). In fact, just two years ago the higher-ups at Netflix said the ability to download content would never happen. \nSo far, it looks like you can only download Netflix Original shows/movies, along with some selected other stuff (there's no official list running around just yet.) But Netflix promised there are \"more on the way\" so your sick, sick dream of watching American Pie Presents: The Book Of Love on a crowded bus could still become a reality.

    "text": "WATCH Syrian Troops Capture Major Aleppo Neighborhood 0 Shares Email It was a long Sunday morning for Um Fawaz and her three children. The bombing had reached peak levels over the last two weeks, even by east Aleppo standards, and finally what they’d been awaiting for months happened: Kurdish forces opened a crossing, allowing civilians to enter their safe enclave. “It was hell, my 1-year-old granddaughter was shaking uncontrollably, terrified by the sound of blasts getting closer and closer,” she told ABC News from the safety of the house her family has taken refuge in. There, in Sheikh Maqsood, under the control of Syrian Kurdish forces, the sky was tranquil. Kurdish forces have had a tacit non-aggression understanding with the government and have been largely spared the brunt of the bombing. Over the weekend, the Syrian military launched a ground offensive on the forward lines of rebel-held east Aleppo, with the significant support of Hezbollah and other allied foreign armed groups. Their advance was swifter than anticipated. By Monday morning, opposition armed factions had lost a third of the territory they’ve been holding for years, bringing the government of President Bashar al-Assad the closest it’s been since the start of the conflict in 2011 to asserting control over all major urban centers. GEORGE OURFALIAN/AFP/Getty Images Syrian pro-government forces walk amidst heavy destruction in Aleppo's Bustan al-Basha neighborhood, Nov. 28, 2016, during their assault to retake the entire northern city from rebel fighters. Syria Forces Advancing in Aleppo, Sending Hundreds Fleeing After months of intense aerial bombing and relentless artillery shelling, rebel defenses buckled. Most symbolically, rebels lost control of Masaken Hanano, the first neighborhood they wrested away from the government in 2012. “The situation in the city is chaotic, no one knows what’s about to happen,” one media activist said. Some residents found the frontline had suddenly moved to their doorstep. Yousef Houran, a lawyer and activist from Aleppo, who now lives in the countryside of Idlib, said that some of his friends in east Aleppo had intended to leave as the government advanced but weren’t able to. “My friends were not able to leave to Sheikh Maqsood because of the intensity of the bombardments from warplanes and all kinds of weapons and missiles,” he told ABC News. Bana, a young girl in east Aleppo who received \"Harry Potter\" ebooks from J.K. Rowling after she shot to fame tweeting, through her mother, about her daily life under siege, said on Sunday that her house had been shelled, sharing a photo of herself covered in dust. Those who are now safe from the bombing, fear retaliation from government forces. An activist told Amnesty International that some male residents of Masaken Hanano were taken to al-Nairab airport for interrogation and screening. Amnesty International called on government forces to “ensure civilians are protected from revenge attacks” even though the organization could not verify these reports. Fawaz, who asked that a pseudonym be used out of fear of retaliation for speaking to the media, was one of the more fortunate this weekend. She fled Sakhour, her neighborhood in east Aleppo, Sunday afternoon with her two daughters, including one who is five months pregnant, her young son and her infant granddaughter. Her husband died before the conflict started in 2011. “The Kurdish forces, God bless them, took us to this house. There are blankets but food is scarce, too many people are now crowded here.” She is sharing a three-room house with 35 people. “It keeps us warm,” she said with a laugh. Nearly 7,000 civilians have fled west to Sheikh Maqsood since Saturday, according to Rami Abdurahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. An additional 3,000 have moved east toward Masaken Hanano, now fully under government control, and from there were taken by government buses to the countryside and finally to an evacuation center in West Aleppo. “Around 100 people or more returned to Hanano because civilians are running out of places to flee to,” said Ibrahim Hilal, leader of the White Helmets in Aleppo, giving a much lower number than that of the SOHR. The Syrian Red Crescent has not yet been able to provide a number for those who fled, but spokeswoman Muna Kurdi told ABC News that “many children and women came; they were given blankets and hot meals and medical teams are going around the evacuation center to provide medicine to those who need it.” Activists in east Aleppo told ABC News the numbers cited by the SOHR are inflated and that the majority of those fleeing took refuge in the Southern part of rebel-held east Aleppo, where the bombing continued Monday. “We all know people who’ve had to leave their homes and seek security with friends and relatives. Everyone is hiding underground,” Bara’a, a nurse who did not give her last name, told ABC News. “The aerial bombing is relentless, nonstop.” Syrian state television on Monday showed drone footage of deserted streets it said was from a few of the neighborhoods government forces and their allies entered over the weekend. The footage did not show devastated buildings opposition activists have shared. Verifying the claims firsthand has become virtually impossible for journalists covering Aleppo as the city has been too dangerous to reach. Last week, the United Nations warned that east Aleppo is now facing widespread starvation after the last U.N. food rations remaining in the city were distributed two weeks ago. Close to 250,000 people are believed to be in east Aleppo, including 100,000 children per UNICEF. They have been besieged for 94 days. Some residents in east Aleppo said they still believed that the besieged city would remain an opposition stronghold despite the recent defeats for rebel forces. “It has not affected my feelings at all because God is with us,” Maha, a teacher in east Aleppo who did not give her last name, told ABC News of the recent advances by Syrian government troops. “And God will help us win.” Additional reporting by Lena Masri and Nasser Atta. 0 Shares ",

    "text": "Instagram Marketing 6 Ways to Convert Your Instagram Audience into Customers Nearly 71 percent of U.S. companies are projected to be active on the platform within the next year. Is your business one of them? Image credit: Svyatkovsky | Shutterstock Watch Now November 29, 2016 \nThanks to the power of its striking visuals, Instagram has emerged in the past year or so as the image-marketer’s favorite social network. Emotionally evocative when they're at their best, Instagram visuals make a quick and lasting impression on audience members. \nRelated: How to Make Your Instagram Account Impressive \nNo wonder nearly 71 percent of U.S. companies are projected to be active on the platform within the next year. \nEngagement is also huge on Instagram. Posts on the platform see some 4.2 billion \"likes\" in any given 24-hour period, and the average account’s follower growth rate is a staggering 237 percent. \nOf course, as happens with any social network, you may fall into the trap of focusing disproportionately on amassing those followers. But, in fact, your follower count is a “vanity metric” -- it doesn’t necessarily translate into actual transactions. \nThe potential is there, though. About 50 percent of all Instagram users follow brand accounts, 60 percent learn about products and services via the platform and 75 percent take action after being inspired by a post -- through actions like visiting a website, performing searches, telling a friend or actually shopping. \nTapping into the sales conversion power of Instagram takes a plan. That’s often easier said than done, however. As marketing-friendly as Instagram may be, it doesn’t support clickable media, aside from one URL in your bio. \nSo, how do you use it to drive organic, engaged traffic to your site and boost sales? That’s where these six simple tips come in handy. 1. Make your posts shoppable. \nThis “shoppable Instagram” solution is the ecommerce tool you wish Instagram had created first. When your followers click through from your bio link to your Yotpo-powered Shoppable Instagram catalog, they’ll see all of your Instagram images, in an interface that looks and feels just like Instagram itself, except that these posts, when clicked, lead to your product pages. \nWhat’s more, it’s all integrated with Yotpo’s powerful tools for collecting and publishing verified customer reviews of your products, so you get the added impact of social proof. Customers feel more confident in their easy and secure purchases. and your bottom line improves. Everybody’s happy. 2. Never underestimate your CTAs. \nInstagram may be a visual platform, but you’ve still got space to add a solid call to action in your post descriptions. Customers want to be told what steps to take next. Including a great call to action (CTA) in every post is a great way to turn those customers from browsers into buyers. \nRelated: 8 Tips to Attract Your First 250K Instagram Followers \nYour CTA doesn’t have to be complex. Try something as simple as “Love it? Click the link in our bio to get your own.” Just make sure to update the URL in your bio to lead to the right product page; then watch the sales roll in. You can do this with a third-party app that optimizes the experience; but manual linking, updating and captioning works too. 3. Reward followers with promo codes. \nGetting your customers to make that first purchase may be one of the biggest hurdles you’ll face. A carefully placed discount offer can be the perfect tool for getting your followers to open their wallets. It adds to the value you provide your followers on an exclusive basis. \nCombined with the right hashtag, this kind of Instagram activity is likely to drive conversions and earn high share counts -- aided no doubt by Instagram’s integrated sharing features for Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare. This tactic pays off handsomely, because when people know they can regularly grab a discount or two from your Instagram feed, they’re all the more likely to stick around. And if you use channel-specific coupon codes, you’ll always know that it’s Instagram that drove those sales. 4. Run a contest. \nAudience members love Instagram contests. In just a few seconds, they can enter to win great prizes -- and you get plenty of new customers ready to buy, having just browsed the goodies you sell after seeing your contest post. If you’re a multi-channel merchant, you can even use this tactic to inspire physical store visits. Just require that people take selfies with the merchandise. \nDriving engagement, sales and follower counts, Instagram contests are an easy way to improve your sales numbers. Managing them and figuring out who wins is another story. Wishpond is an easy-to-use option that integrates with everything from MailChimp to Salesforce, helping you get the most bang for your contest buck. With a free 14-day trial, there’s little risk in taking this contest app for a test run. 5. Show off the people who love your brand. \nUser-generated content is marketing gold . It connects your customers directly with your brand, helps them feel connected to you and provides authenticity in a way nothing else can. Harnessing it can be tough on most social platforms, but Instagram is different. \nThe speed and appeal of Instagram makes it easy to search or ask for great content and share it quickly. And when you're a customer who can actually see real people using a product, it’s that much easier to identify and picture yourself in a similar use-case situation. \nThere are plenty of ways to get started with this tactic. You can tie it into a contest as I mentioned above, offer a discount for the first 100 customers to show off your product with a matching hashtag or get influencers in on the game, as Chanel did in this unbeatable campaign . 6. Tell a great (visual) story. \nStorytelling: You know how valuable it is, but when you don’t have words at your disposal, how can you capture a great story? Start by remembering the old cliché that a picture is worth a thousand words. \nInstagram storytelling can be done with a single still, if it’s done well. What’s more, using Instagram videos gives you more time to get your message across, especially if your customers have autoplay enabled. You can also test your creativity, with the new Instagram Stories feature to create series of annotated posts. \nThe new feature lets you post a story that disappears in 24 hours, so it’s a great way to share promo codes or discounts. Just make sure your imagery is as exciting as the product or service you’re selling. What’s next? \nRunning a contest will help you catch more attention and attract shoppers who love your style, but to keep them, you need to stay creative, no matter what industry you’re in. You can do that through creative messaging, user-driven content or visual storytelling. \nRelated: 9 Tools to Improve Your Instagram Marketing If your Instagram feed is looking a little lackluster, use the tips above to help you rethink your current strategy. Make sure you are using clear calls to action, give your customers the chance to shop for your products with as little friction as possible and offer the occasional discount or promo code to nudge them closer to making that purchase. It’s time to move past gaining followers to making sales. Pratik Dholakiya Pratik Dholakiya is the co-founder of E2M, a digital marketing agency, and Preceptist, a content marketing agency.

Credit: © Anton Gepolov / Fotolia Close A breathing-based meditation practice known as Sudarshan Kriya yoga helped alleviate severe depression in people who did not fully respond to antidepressant treatments, reports a new study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry from researchers in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The study bolsters the science behind the use of controlled yogic breathing to help battle depression. \nIn a randomized, controlled pilot study, led by Anup Sharma, MD, PhD, a Neuropsychiatry research fellow in the department of Psychiatry at Penn, researchers found significant improvement in symptoms of depression and anxiety in medicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who participated in the breathing technique compared to medicated patients who did not partake. After two months, the yoga group cut its mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score by several points, while the control group showed no improvements. HDRS is the most widely used clinician-administered depression assessment that scores mood, interest in activities, energy, suicidal thoughts, and feelings of guilt, among other symptoms. \nMore than half of the 41 million Americans who take antidepressants do not fully respond. Add-on therapies are often prescribed to enhance the effects of the drugs in these patients, but they typically offer limited additional benefits and come with side effects that can curb use, prolonging the depressive episode. What's more, patients who don't fully respond to antidepressants are especially at risk of relapse. \n\"With such a large portion of patients who do not fully respond to antidepressants, it's important we find new avenues that work best for each person to beat their depression,\" Sharma said. \"Here, we have a promising, lower-cost therapy that could potentially serve as an effective, non-drug approach for patients battling this disease.\" \nThe meditation technique, which is practiced in both a group setting and at home, includes a series of sequential, rhythm-specific breathing exercises that bring people into a deep, restful, and meditative state: slow and calm breaths alternated with fast and stimulating breaths. \n\"Sudarshan Kriya yoga gives people an active method to experience a deep meditative state that's easy to learn and incorporate in diverse settings,\" Sharma said. \nIn past studies, the practice has demonstrated a positive response in patients with milder forms of depression, depression due to alcohol dependence, and in patients with MDD; however, there are no clinical studies investigating its use for depression in an outpatient setting. Past studies suggest that yoga and other controlled breathing techniques can potentially adjust the nervous system to reduce stress hormones. Overall, the authors also note, well-designed studies that evaluate the benefits of yoga to treat depression are lacking, despite increased interest in the ancient Indian practice. Millions of Americans participate in some form of yoga every year. \nIn the study, researchers enrolled 25 patients suffering from MDD who were depressed, despite more than eight weeks of antidepressant medication treatment. The medicated patients were randomized to either the breathing intervention group or the \"waitlist\" control group for eight weeks. (The waitlist group was offered the yoga intervention after the study). During the first week, participants completed a six-session program, which featured Sudarshan Kriya yoga in addition to yoga postures, sitting meditation, and stress education. For weeks two through eight, participants attended weekly Sudarshan Kriya yoga follow-up sessions and completed a home practice version of the technique. \nPatients in the Sudarshan Kriya yoga group showed a significantly greater improvement in HDRS scores compared to patients in the waitlist group. With a mean baseline HDRS score of 22.0 (indicating severe depression at the beginning of the study), the group that completed the breathing technique for the full two months improved scores by 10.27 points on average, compared to the waitlist group, which showed no improvements. Patients in the yoga group also showed significant mean reductions in total scores of the self-reported Beck Depression (15.48 point improvement) and Beck Anxiety Inventories (5.19 point improvement), versus the waitlist control group. \nResults of the pilot study suggest the feasibility and promise of Sudarshan Kriya as an add-on intervention for MDD patients who have not responded to antidepressants, the authors wrote. \"The next step in this research is to conduct a larger study evaluating how this intervention impacts brain structure and function in patients who have major depression,\" Sharma said. \n  Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania .

Ware | Nov. 22, 2016 at 3:29 PM Comments \nMOSCOW, Nov. 22 (UPI) -- A $30 million Russian fighter jet crashed into the Mediterranean Sea earlier this month because it ran out of fuel while it waited for an aircraft carrier to fix its landing equipment, U.S. naval officials said. \nThe Soviet-era Mikoyan MiG-29K crashed Nov. 13 off the coast of Syria after its first attempt to land on the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov failed, the United States Naval Institute said Tuesday , based on the translation of a Russian report. \nThe MiG-29K was flying a sortie with two other aircraft in the area near Syria and was the last that attempted to land. When the aircraft ahead of the MiG broke the landing cable on the carrier, the pilot had to fly out over the Mediterranean and wait for the cable to be repaired, the Russian report said . \nWhile the aircraft was awaiting the repairs, it ran out of fuel and dropped into the sea. RELATED Nov. 13: Russian fighter jet crashes into Mediterranean Sea near Syria \n\"While in the holding area, both of the fighter's engines shut down,\" the translation of the Russian report said. \"A preliminary explanation is that they were no longer receiving fuel. ln such situations, a fighter falls like a rock, and the pilot has only one option -- to eject.\" \nThe MiG pilot did eject and was rescued by helicopter a short time later. \nNATO ships in the area offered to assist, but the Russians refused, a NATO official told USNI News last week. \nThe MiG-29K was developed and made its first flight in the 1980s but didn't enter Russian service until 2010. Each jet costs about $30 million.",

By: FE Online | Published:  59 PM The Supreme Court has ordered the cancellation of the licenses of all the fire cracker sellers. (PTI) \nThe Supreme Court on Friday ordered a ban on the sale of fire crackers in Delhi and the National Capital Region due to the ever increasing pollution level in the region. The Supreme Court has ordered the cancellation of the licenses of all the fire cracker sellers. The decision by the apex court has been hailed as a big step in the efforts to curb the pollution level in the state. The Supreme Court also asked the Central Pollution Control Board to file a reply within 3 months regarding the harmful effects of fire crackers. \nThe Supreme Court ordered that the ban on the sale of fire crackers had to enforced from today till any further order or any hearings are conducted by the apex court. It was reported that environmentalists were seeking the Supreme Court’s intervention in passing orders for a ban on fire crackers owing to the increasing level of pollution in the national capital. \nEarlier in the month of October/November, following Diwali, the entire Delhi NCR region was seen covered in thick layers of smog for weeks. It was reported the pollution level in the region was 17 times more than what was permissible for being a safe place to breathe in. Although, it was later revealed that the burning of paddy stubbles in large quantity by farmers in Punjab was a major contributing factor for the smog, a lot of fire crackers burst in the region was also a cause for the air pollution.

But a liberal super PAC is now saying they want to tie Bannon’s reputations “around the necks” of Republican senators. \n“Help us tie Trump’s racist Chief Strategist around the necks of vulnerable Senate Republicans,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), wrote in an email to supporters titled “Air this ad on MSNBC?” Wednesday night. \nYikes… \nThe tolerant left strikes again. \nAlways fun to make jokes about killing someone. \nThis obviously represents a ridiculous and troubling double standard. \nAnd just for the record, there is zero credible evidence that Steve Bannon is a racist. \nZero.",

    "text": "Tucker Carlson, the new golden boy of Fox News, could easily have lost his TV career years ago after he was falsely accused of rape, he has revealed. \nThe dapper host's blossoming career - which has gone into overdrive since the huge ratings of his new primetime Fox News show - could have been cut short if the accusation contained in a lawyer's letter had been made public in the early 2000s. \nAnd now the woman who accused him has exclusively told DailyMail.com that it was all a misunderstanding - brought on by a mental health condition from which she was suffering. \n'I was delusional,' admitted Kimberly Carter, whom Carlson, 47, named in his 2003 book, Politicians, Partisans and Parasites. \nShe also blamed her lawyer, saying he should never have written to the TV host threatening to prosecute him for sexual assault. \nScroll down for video \nTucker Carlson, the new golden boy of Fox News, could easily have lost his TV career years ago after he was falsely accused of rape, he has revealed\nKimberly Carter, the woman who accused Carlson, (pictured on her now-defunct accountancy website) told DailyMail.com that it was a misunderstanding \nCarter, who lives in Indiana, told DailyMail.com that she suffers from schizoaffective disorder, a condition with symptoms similar to schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder. \nShe said a friend had told her that Carlson would be at Harper's Restaurant, a burger and pizza joint in Louisville, Kentucky, and she went along to try to meet him. 'I had a bit of a crush on him at the time,' she said. \nCarter, now 56, said she fell while in the restaurant, hitting her head. 'The next thing I knew people were waking me up with smelling salts.' \nShe said she spoke to her attorney Paul 'Matt' Blanton and told him something may have happened in the restaurant and she may have been molested, but she wasn't certain. \n'I said \"don't do anything about it until I find out for sure\", but he went ahead and wrote the letter,' added Carter. \n'I think he was trying to make a name for himself, but he didn't have my permission to write that letter,' she insisted. \nCarlson's onetime accuser said she later realized she had not been molested and she wrote to him to apologize. \nThe TV star's new show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, debuted last Monday, drawing in 3.7 million viewers - Fox's biggest audience of the year during that time slot, according to Nielsen Media Research. The viewing figures were more than the audience for CNN and MSNBC combined. \nBut in his book, Politicians, Partisans and Parasites, Carlson - who has been married to high school sweetheart Susan Andrews since 1991 - revealed that the false charge could easily have ended his career in television shortly after it began. \nCarlson has been married to high school sweetheart Susan Andrews since 1991 (pictured together in 2013)\nHe was accused while working for his first TV employer, CNN, where he was employed from 2000 to 2005. And he realized the Atlanta-based network would have had no compunction in canning him if the allegation leaked out. \n'I knew the network would fire me immediately if it found out about the letter, and certainly if charges were filed against me,' he wrote. \n'The one thing every journalist knows for certain about sex scandals is that they're always true. Partly true anyway. \n'Maybe you didn't rape this woman, they'd think; maybe you just had unusually rough sadomasochistic sex with her and she misconstrued it. Or maybe your affair with her simply fell apart in an acrimonious way, perhaps over your cocaine habit. \n'Maybe you had sex with her but never knew her name. Something definitely happened between you, though. People don't just make up specific allegations out of nothing.' \nThe TV star's new show, Tucker Carlson Tonight, debuted last Monday, drawing in 3.7 million viewers - Fox's biggest audience of the year during that time slot, according to Nielsen Media Research\nThe viewing figures for the show's debut were more than the audience for CNN and MSNBC combined\nBut Carlson, who has become cable news's latest 'overnight sensation' after more than a decade and a half of bouncing around from CNN to MSNBC to Fox, insists that's exactly what happened with him. \nIn the book, written in 2003 when he was still with CNN, Carlson went into great detail about how the supposed incident in Louisville occurred. \n'We met at Harper's Restaurant on Hurstborne Parkway, where I slipped narcotics into her drink,' wrote Carlson, describing Carter's account of the attack. \n'She knew immediately that she had been violently raped. By me. In the restaurant. Presumably within view of dozens of other people, not one of whom had thought to report the crime to the police or the press. \n'It was a preposterous story. I'd never heard of Harper's Restaurant. I'd never been to Louisville. Judging from my schedule in March, I couldn't have gotten there. I was on television almost every night in Washington.' \nBut Carlson said that even though his hotshot Washington D.C. lawyer Bob Bennett explained to Carter's attorney that the accusation was simply not believable, he was given just a week to prove it was untrue or Blanton would take the case to the prosecutor. \n'By the way,' Blanton allegedly added, 'we have evidence that Carlson and my client know each other. There's correspondence.' \nBlanton was referring to fan letters that his client had written to Carlson, the TV talking head said. \nCarlson named Carter and described the incident in his 2003 book, Politicians, Partisans and Parasites\n'Twice she had sent me small gifts, keychains, and ballpoint pens. I wrote her thank-you notes both times, hence her lawyer's claim about \"correspondence\". I hadn't remembered any of this. \n'Later, one of my producers dug up an e-mail Carter sent me. \"I watch your show all of the time,\" it said. \"You are great.\"' \nCarlson claimed she had written it on his birthday, a month after he had supposedly raped her. \n'It's hard to hate someone who is delusional, and as angry as I was, I was inclined to give Carter a pass on grounds of craziness,' Carlson wrote, but her attorney was another matter. \n'(T)he weaselly, pompous little Matt Blanton - I wanted to kill him. At the very least I wanted him to pay my legal bills, which by this point had reached over $14,000, not a dime of it covered by insurance or the network. And I wanted a prolonged, groveling, preferably tearful apology for sending a letter to my place of work accusing me of a felony sex crime.' \nBut he didn't get either because his own lawyers pointed out that trying to sue the lawyer would only draw attention to the fact that he had been accused of rape in the first place. \n'In the end, my name would be joined in the same sentence with the word rape, and it was worth at least fourteen grand to keep that from happening.' \nA week after the case was dropped, Carter sent Carlson a letter. \n'In light of the evidence that you provided to me, obviously the person who had assaulted me was not in actuality Tucker Carlson, but an imposter,' she wrote. That infuriated Carlson even more. \n'She said sorry, sort of, and that was the extent of her contrition,' he wrote in his book. \n'Because, as she went on to explain, she's the real victim here. \"I don't appreciate the statements that you made about my mental status,\" Carter wrote, launching into a lecture about the need to show sensitivity and tolerance toward people with emotional disabilities. \n'I am a highly educated individual, with multiple degrees,' she said. \nYes, she conceded, 'I am a manic-depressive.' But 'everyone of concern knows that this condition can be very well managed. It is usually the ignorant that sensationalize it. There are some very successful people who have this condition. I know many.' \n'In other words,\" the TV host wrote, \"Carter's craziness may have cost me thousands of dollars and jeopardized my career, my reputation, and my freedom. But it was still wrong of me - \"ignorant\" - to suggest that her mental illness might not be such a good thing. \n'Nuts or not, Kimberly Carter had a lot of chutzpah,' he wrote. \nSix months later, Carter contacted him again, sending a clock radio with his name on and apologizing 'for the misunderstanding.' Another letter followed in which she called herself 'Your Biggest Fan!' \n'Her next card had five exclamation points, which I took as a sign of escalating mania. I looked her up on the Internet to try to assess the threat. \n'She was there. In fact, she had her own website, www.accounting-computing.com, complete with a photograph of herself sitting at the computer. I'd never seen her before. She was a heavyset woman in her early forties with waist-length hair and short bangs. She didn't look crazy. \n'The site gave me the creeps, and I was tempted to call her and tell her to stop bothering me,' he wrote. \n'I never did, though. No matter how tempting it may be, no good can come from corresponding with the mentally ill.' \nCarlson overcame the allegation and now his career is blossoming. His new show’s debut last week won the second highest ratings all year for the 7 pm slot with 3.7 million viewers and continued with high ratings throughout its first week. \nDailyMail.com put calls in to Blanton's office in Paoli, Indiana, but they were not returned.",

    "text": "IN AN age when diners can pick the cuts of chicken they prefer, why would anyone choose to make a beeline for chicken feet curry? \nAt Gerai Pak Hassan, a stall famed for serving crispy roti canai with chicken feet curry, diners offer their own opinion. \nEating chicken feet is supposed to help one run faster, says one off-duty law enforcer who also plays rugby. \nChicken feet is rich in collagen, says one female diner who is convinced her breakfast session is going to benefit her skin. Fact or an old wives’ tale? \nWhere stall owners Abu Bakar Mohamad and wife, Roslaini Amiruddin, (known as Pak Hassan and Mama to regulars) are concerned, its introduction in 2000 has only meant one thing – a long line of customers.\n“Before this, we only made up to 12kg of roti canai dough per day. \n“After we started having the chicken feet curry for our roti canai dip, production went up to 45kg per day,” confirmed Pak Hassan. \nThe runaway success of what was originally intended as a side for Pak Hassan’s flatbread stems from his desire for taste improvement.\nHe had been toying with the chicken feet idea from his earlier days as an economy rice hawker in 1993. \nA generous helping of chicken feet curry. \n“Whenever there was chicken on the menu, we ended up with lots of feet. So, I thought why not put them into the lentil curry, for a meatier taste. \n“It just so happened that the chicken supplier said he had lots of chicken bones leftover from satay-making, if I was interested. I thought they would add up to a good stock,” he recalled.\nBut the real star of the show is Pak Hassan’s crisp and aromatic roti canai . The recipe dates back to the 1930s and belonged to his late father, P. Mohamed Bidau, an Indian Muslim from Kerala, India who ran a coffeeshop in Sungai Siput, Perak. \n“My father’s recipe called for wheat flour, water, salt, sugar and a little bit of milk. \n“I was the one who decided to add in egg to the mix. The ratio is 10 eggs for every 25kg of flour.\n“But that little bit gives it a different flavour,” he said. \nPak Hassan’s roti canai and chicken feet curry has diners queuing up for their turn in front of the stall. \nHot off the griddle roti canai for diners. \nMany diners seem to favour the roti plaster (flatbread with an egg yolk embedded in it). \nThe chicken feet curry is self-service and the practice is to heap a small plate with as many plump feet as the plate can hold. \nDiners then sink their teeth into the soft, gelatinous claws to pick at the skin, tendons and bones. \nAll that chicken feet has created a noticeable characteristic in the curry. It is no thicker than your regular dhal dip but it has a slight gummy consistency. \nPartnered with the roti , the sensation is not unlike having a spicy cotton candy melting in your mouth. \nThe fare at Pak Hassan’s is undoubtedly calorie-rich. \nJames Chin, a regular customer of Pak Hassan’s for 30 years, says he visits the stall, once a week at most, as a way of keeping his diet in check. But on days when temptation is strong, he settles for what he thinks is a “healthier” alternative – the nasi lemak which sports a fiery but addictive sambal. \nGerai Pak Hassan is located at 45, Madrasah Ar-Rahmaniah, 45, Jalan Raja Abdullah, Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur. Open: 6am to 2pm. Closed on Mondays. (Opposite Menara DBKL3).",

Rodolfo Fariñas said that the House may file a criminal case against De Lima for obstruction of justice, in the level of the regional trial court. \nThe House may also file an administrative complaint with the Supreme Court on grounds of ethical misconduct.

    "text": "Climate Rapidly Changing Arctic Braces for Destabilization A new report documents how the effects of global warming, such as sea ice and permafrost loss, cascade throughout the ecosystem By Scott Waldman , ClimateWire on November 28, 2016 Share on Facebook   \nGlobal warming’s transformation of the Arctic is having a cascading effect, with some changes to the region worsening others. \nThe loss of sea ice is the most visible, and temperatures almost 40 degrees above normal certainly garner attention. However, there are other important changes such as the loss of permafrost, the collapse of certain species in the food chain and the damage to fisheries caused by higher sea temperatures. \nPerhaps more troubling is that those changes are often interlinked, and one shift can trigger a series of others, a new report has found. \nThe Arctic Resilience Report, released Friday, is a five-year scientific and sociological effort to understand the changes now occurring in the region, as well as an examination on how local communities can be more resilient. Produced by a consortium of research groups under the auspices of the Arctic Council, it documents some of the changes observed in recent decades and looks at how some communities have successfully responded. \nThose cascading effects are reorganizing the Arctic ecosystem in a way that is increasingly painting a dire picture, said Marcus Carson, a researcher at the Stockholm Environment Institute. \nSome changes, such as the loss of sea ice, are widely understood, but there are many other areas where the Arctic has been fundamentally transformed and too little is understood about what changes are occurring, the report found. \n“It’s a little bit like firing your cue ball into the rest of the balls on the pool table, you don’t know where things are going to go, and the potential feedback in that system is the most unsettling given the pace of the changes that we understand fairly well,” he said. Immediate Arctic challenges for Trump \nScientists have long viewed global warming’s transformation of the Arctic as a bellwether for the rest of the planet. The new study shows that effects seen in other parts of the globe, such as record-breaking warmth, are often amplified in the Arctic. \nAs with all issues currently surrounding climate science, the effects of the incoming Trump administration’s policies on the Arctic could lead to further shifts in the region. Carson said the effects of climate change in the Arctic already transcend partisan politics because there is no arguing about the transformation. \n“What we see happening in the Arctic takes it beyond arguments about models, and what predictions are, because the extent of change is beyond anything we’ve seen before,” he said. “I think you would be very hard-pressed to find anyone in the Arctic, regardless of party identification, who doesn’t believe that climate change is taking place.” \nOne of the key Arctic issues that will immediately confront President-elect Donald Trump is the newly accessible oil and gas reserves that climate change has unlocked as sea ice shrinks, Carson said. In addition to the risk in accessing those fossil fuels, it will only encourage more consumption, he said. That, in turn, will lead to more melting in the Arctic. \nThe changes in the Arctic affect the entire planet, through rising sea levels, shifts in the polar vortex and warming ocean currents that change weather patterns. But they are particularly difficult for people who live in the region. Already, there are dozens of communities threatened by climate change, including some that will have to be relocated within the next few decades. \nOthers have adapted resilience strategies that can be applied more broadly to other communities in the area. It will take efforts in countries throughout the world to limit carbon emissions. \n“Living in one of the world’s most variable biomes means that people of the Arctic, and in particular the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic, know a great deal about resilience,” the authors wrote. “But the current scope and pace of change means they cannot do it alone. The resilience of Arctic communities and ecosystems depends not only on the commitment and imagination of Arctic people, but also on the active support of Arctic countries’ governments and other partners.” A call for cooperation \nSome communities have already adapted to transformations in the environment. \nNomadic hunters in the Nunavut region of Canada have become internationally recognized artists. Communities in Iceland once reliant on fishing have instead turned to whale-watching as an income source as those stocks were depleted. Others have found a way to maintain traditions, such as whaling and reindeer herding, as the climate warms. \nBut further changes, particularly if global carbon emissions are not curbed, mean further work is necessary, the report found. \nAnd preserving the ecological health of the region will require more cooperation among the Arctic nations, including Russia, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Canada, Denmark and the United States, the report concludes. \n“The variety of effects that we could see means that Arctic people and policies must prepare for surprise,” said Johan Rockström, executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “We also expect that some of those changes will destabilize the regional and global climate, with potentially major impacts.” \nReprinted from ClimateWire with permission from E&E News.

    "text": "The Clinton campaign isn’t giving desperate supporters much to hope for. Photo: Yuri Gripas/AFP/Getty Images Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign announced on Saturday that it will play a role in vote recounts in three key battleground states won by Donald Trump on election day, CNN reports . The announcement aligns the Clinton camp with the efforts of Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who has raised millions of dollars to fund recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. On Friday, Wisconsin state officials confirmed that the Stein campaign successfully petitioned for a recount before that day’s 5 p.m. deadline, and the recount will now begin, though it is not at all clear that the state will be able to conclude the recount process before December 13, when electoral college voters cast their votes for the country’s next president. Official recount requests are due in Pennsylvania and Michigan early next week, and the Stein campaign is expected to meet those deadlines as well. The Stein campaign, which says it is pursuing the recounts to ensure the integrity of the election, has raised more than $5.7 million as of midday Saturday.\nThe calls for more scrutiny of the results in the three states started after a group of computer scientists and election lawyers said that they had discovered evidence that election results in those states may have been manipulated, as originally reported by New York ’s Gabriel Sherman.\nHowever, Saturday’s announcement from the Clinton campaign came with a considerable amount of cold water for anyone who believes that the election results were indeed rigged or hacked, or that the Clinton campaign has not already been doing its due diligence regarding such concerns. Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias, in a Medium post explaining the campaign’s response , references the Stein campaign’s efforts, but adds that the Clinton team did not find enough evidence to merit taking such action themselves, though they will participate now that Stein’s campaign is proceeding:\nBecause we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states — Michigan — well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself.\nThe campaign is grateful to all those who have expended time and effort to investigate various claims of abnormalities and irregularities. While that effort has not, in our view, resulted in evidence of manipulation of results, now that a recount is underway, we believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported.\nRegarding the investigation of those claims of abnormalities and irregularities, Elias explains that the campaign has already had lawyers, data scientists, and analysts look for evidence of hacking, and that the campaign has been cataloging and investigating every theory of manipulation that they could. Elias says the campaign also spoke with outside experts to hear out their concerns and review their findings, as well as get those experts’ opinions on the Clinton campaign’s internal data and findings. The campaign has additionally conducted a review of all relevant election laws and practices regarding the recount and audit processes, and, according to Elias, “most importantly, we have monitored and staffed the post-election canvasses — where voting machine tapes are compared to poll-books, provisional ballots are resolved, and all of the math is double checked from election night.”\nElias highlights that the continued counting and verification of votes has led to Clinton having built a two-million-vote lead in the popular vote, but again, the campaign has not found compelling evidence of voter fraud or result manipulation — though Elias does makes a point to complain about how Michigan and many other states do not automatically conduct basic audits of their results ‘to ensure accuracy and public confidence in the election.”\nThe Clinton campaign is not alone in casting doubt on theories of election manipulation, either. The White House, in a statement released on Friday, concluded that the integrity of vote on election day was not not compromised by the efforts of state-supported Russian hackers, with the Obama administration announcing that “we stand behind our election results, which accurately reflect the will of the American people.”\n“The Kremlin probably expected that publicity surrounding the disclosures that followed the Russian government-directed compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations, would raise questions about the integrity of the election process that could have undermined the legitimacy of the president-elect,” the statement read, but the Obama administration does not believe that effort was successful. The New York Times also notes , however, that\nintelligence officials are still investigating the impact of a broader Russian “information warfare” campaign, in which fake news about Mrs. Clinton, and about United States-Russia relations, appeared intended to influence voters. Many of those false reports originated from RT News and Sputnik, two state-funded Russian sites.\nThose fake-news reports were widely circulated on social media, independent studies, including one set for release soon, have shown, sometimes in an organized fashion by groups that appear to have had common ownership. Individuals, conservative talk-show hosts and activists recirculated them, often not knowing, or apparently not caring, about the accuracy of the reports.\nBut regarding the White House’s endorsement of the election’s legitimacy, as New York ’s Gabriel Sherman originally noted, the Obama administration had already been discouraging the Clinton campaign from contesting the results of the election. President Obama also apparently advised Hillary Clinton to concede to Donald Trump on election night, according to a forthcoming book about Clinton’s defeat, per The Hill .\nTags: rigged elections hillary clinton clinton campaign jill stein donald trump politics early and often More S h a r e o n F a c e b o o k T w e e t t h i s S t o r y Top Stories Clinton Campaign Will Take Part in Election Recounts, but Doubts Manipulation Cuban Leader Fidel Castro Has Died In the Age of Trump, Should Protest Be Angry or Optimistic?

    "text": "By Charles Montaldo Updated March 01, 2016 . \nDavid Berkowitz , better known as Son of Sam, is an infamous 1970s New York City serial killer who killed six people and wounded several others. His crimes became legendary because of the bizarre content in the letters that he wrote to the police and the media and his reasons for committing the attacks. With the police feeling the pressure to catch the killer, \"Operation Omega\" was formed, which was comprised of over 200 detectives; all working on finding the Son of Sam before he killed again. Berkowitz's Childhood \nDavid Berkowitz, born June 1, 1953, was the adopted son of Nathan and Pearl Berkowitz. The family lived in a middle-class home in the Bronx. The couple loved and doted on their son yet Berkowitz grew up feeling rejected and scorned because of being adopted. His size and appearance did not help matters. He was larger than most of the kids his age and not particularly attractive. His parents were not social people and Berkowitz followed in that path, developing a reputation for being a loner . Berkowitz was Plagued with Guilt and Anger: \nBerkowitz was an average student and did not show any particular flair for any one subject. He did, however, develop into a decent baseball player which became his main outside activity. Around the neighborhood he had a reputation for being hyper and a bully. Believing his natural mother died while giving birth to him was the source of intense guilt and anger inside Berkowitz. Some believe it was the reason for his anti-social and aggressive behavior as a child. The Death of His Mother \nPearl Berkowitz had a reoccurrence with breast cancer and died in 1967. Berkowitz was devastated and became severely depressed. He viewed his mother’s death as a master plot designed to destroy him. He began to fail in school and spent most all of his time alone. When his father remarried in 1971, his new wife did not get along with the young Berkowitz, and the newly weds moved to Florida leaving 18-year-old Berkowitz behind. Berkowitz Reunites with His Birth Mother \nBerkowitz joined the army and after a disastrous three years he left the service. During that time, he had his one and only sexual experience with a prostitute and caught a venereal disease. When he returned home from the army, he found out his natural mother was still alive and that he had a sister. There was a brief reunion, but eventually Berkowitz stopped visiting. His isolation, fantasies, and paranoid delusions were now in full force. Driven By Demons \nOn Christmas Eve 1975, Berkowitz’s “demons” drove him out into the streets with a hunting knife to find a victim to kill. Later he confessed to plunging his knife into two women, one which could not be confirmed. The second victim, 15-year-old Michelle Forman, survived the attack and was treated for six knife wounds. Soon after the attacks, Berkowitz moved out of the Bronx to a two-family home in Yonkers. It was in this home that the Son of Sam would be created. Howling dogs in the neighborhood kept Berkowitz from sleeping and in his deranged mind , he turned their howls into messages from demons that were ordering him to go kill women. He later said that in an attempt to quiet the demons, he began to do what they asked. Jack and Nann Cassara owned the home and in time Berkowitz became convinced that the quiet couple was in truth, part of the demon conspiracy, with Jack being General Jack Cosmo, commander in chief of the dogs that tormented him. When he moved away from the Cassaras into an apartment on Pine Street, he failed to escape the controlling demons. His new neighbor, Sam Carr, had a black Labrador named Harvey, who Berkowitz believed was also possessed. He eventually shot the dog, but that did not offer him relief because he had come to believe that Sam Carr was possessed by the most powerful demon of them all, possibly Satan himself. Nightly the demons screamed at Berkowitz to go kill, their thirst for blood unquenchable. The Arrest of the Son of Sam \nBerkowitz was eventually caught after receiving a parking ticket at the time and near the place of the Moskowitz murder. That evidence along with letters he wrote to Carr and the Cassaras, his military background, his appearance, and an arson incident, led police to his door. When he was arrested he immediately surrendered to police and identified himself as Sam. After being evaluated, it was determined that he could stand trial. He pled not guilty and received a 365-year sentence. Berkowitz's Crime Spree: July 29, 1976 – Jody Valenti and Donna Lauria were shot as they sat talking in a parked car outside Donna’s apartment. Lauria died instantly from a gunshot wound to her neck. Valenti survived the attack. October 23, 1976 – Carl Denaro and Rosemary Keenan were shot while sitting in Denaro’s parked car. Both survived, but Carl was struck in the head by one of the bullets. November 26, 1976 – Donna DeMasi and 18-year-old Joanne Lomino were walking near Joanne’s home after a late movie. Berkowitz followed them briefly, then shot them. Donna survived without suffering permanent physical harm, but Joanne was paralyzed for life. January 30, 1977 – 26-year-old Christine Freund and her fiance John Diel were shot as they sat in a parked car. Christine died and John Diel survived the attack. March 8, 1977 – Virginia Voskerichian, a Barnard College honor student was shot and killed while walking home from class. April 17, 1977 – 18-year-old Valentina Suriani and her 20-year-old boyfriend Alexander Esau, were both shot twice. Both died as a result of gunshot wounds. Berkowitz left a letter at the scene, signed “Son of Sam.” June 26, 1977 – Judy Placido and Sal Lupu were shot while leaving a disco. Both survived although Judy was shot three times. July 31, 1977 – Bobby Violante and Stacy Moskowitz were shot in the car while parked at a lover’s lane. Stacy died from a gunshot wound to her head and Bobby lost vision in one eye and partial vision in the other eye. The Ressler Interview \nIn 1979, Berkowitz was interviewed by FBI veteran, Robert Ressler. Berkowitz admitted that he invented the “Son of Sam” stories so that if caught he could convince the court that he was insane. He said the real reason he killed was because he felt resentment toward his mother and his failures with women. He found killing the women to be sexually arousing. \nToday Berkowitz is a born-again Christian and described as a model prisoner.",

(Picture: Shelter Me) \nWell, this is heartbreaking. Here are the most ridiculous Christmas jumpers you need to buy this year \nZuzu the 2-year-old German shepherd was abandoned at the Downey Animal Care Center in California, after her dad had passed away and her owners found her too sad to deal with. \nShe had jumped into the neighbours’s garden, and was taken by animal control when the neighbours realised how unhappy Zuzu was. \nSlowly Zuzu started to settle in at the centre. Staff described her as ‘beautiful and loving’, and she was gradually getting back to her happy self. (Picture: Shelter Me) \nThen, one day, her previous owners showed up at the shelter. \nZuzu wagged her tail, barked, and generally looked overjoyed when she spotted her former family walking by the fence. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \n‘She looked like the happiest dog,’ wrote a volunteer at the shelter on Facebook. ‘Yeah, she’s going home.’ \nBut after looking at Zuzu, her owners kept walking. (Picture: Shelter Me) \nDesi spoke to the family and discovered that actually, they weren’t there to pick up their dog. They had come to the shelter to adopt a new pet. \nSo essentially, they had decided that Zuzu wasn’t good enough and wanted to replace her with a newer, happier model. \nZuzu had to watch as her former owners walked away and left her at the shelter. (Picture: Shelter Me) \nIt’s not clear whether the family were able to adopt a new dog or not, but Zuzu has now been given to a rescue group that is dedicated to finding her a new home. \nHere’s hoping that Zuzu will find a loving home, with a family that won’t abandon her when things get tough. \nPoor Zuzu deserves so much better.

    "text": "LA UNION, Colombia -- A chartered plane carrying a Brazilian soccer team to the biggest match of its history crashed into a Colombian hillside and broke into pieces, killing 75 people and leaving six survivors, Colombian officials said Tuesday.\nThe British Aerospace 146 short-haul plane, operated by a charter airline with roots in Venezuela, declared an emergency and lost radar contact just before 10 p.m. Monday (0300 GMT Tuesday) because of an electrical failure, aviation authorities said.\nThe aircraft, which had departed from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, was carrying the up and coming Chapecoense soccer team from southern Brazil for Wednesday's first leg of a two-game Copa Sudamericana final against Atletico Nacional of Medellin -- the continent's second-most-important championship.\n\"What was supposed to be a celebration has turned into a tragedy,\" Medellin Mayor Federico Gutierrez said from the search and rescue command centre.\nThe club said in a brief statement on its Facebook page, \"May God accompany our athletes, officials, journalists and other guests travelling with our delegation.\"\nExpressions of grief poured in from all over the soccer world. South America's federation cancelled all scheduled matches in a show of solidarity, Real Madrid's squad interrupted its training for a minute of silence and Argentina legend Diego Maradona sent his condolences to the victims' families over Facebook.\nRescuers working through the night were initially heartened after pulling three passengers alive from the wreckage. But as the hours passed, heavy rainfall and low visibility grounded helicopters and slowed efforts to reach the crash site.\nAt daybreak, dozens of bodies were quickly collected into white bags while rescuers scavenged through pieces of the plane's fuselage strewn across the muddy mountainside.\nImages broadcast on local television showed three passengers arriving to a local hospital in ambulances on stretchers and covered in blankets connected to an IV. Among the survivors was Chapecoense defender Alan Ruschel, who doctors said suffered spinal injuries.\nTwo goalkeepers, Danilo and Jackson Follmann, as well as a journalist travelling with the team and a Bolivian flight attendant, were found alive in the wreckage. But Danilo was later reported as dead, and authorities said another defender, Helio Zampier, had survived amid a confusion of sometimes conflicting early reports.\nThe aircraft is owned by LaMia, a company with roots in Venezuela and that has a close relationship with several premier South American squads.\nArgentina's state-run news agency said the plane involved in the crash had transported Barcelona striker Lionel Messi and the national team this month from Brazil to Colombia between World Cup qualifier matches. The airliner also reportedly transported Venezuela's national squad and several top teams from Bolivia in the past.\nLaMia's website, which is no longer online, said it operated three 146 Avro short-haul jets made by British Aerospace and with a maximum range of around 2,965 kilometres (1,600 nautical miles) -- about the same as the distance between Santa Cruz and Medellin, the route it was flying when it went down.\nAlfredo Bocanegra, the head of Colombia's aviation authority, said initial reports suggest the aircraft was suffering electrical problems although investigators were also looking into an account from one of the survivors that the plane had run out of fuel about five minutes from its expected landing at Jose Maria Cordova airport outside Medellin.\nBolivia's civil aviation agency said the aircraft picked up the Brazilian team in Santa Cruz, where players had arrived earlier in the day on a commercial flight from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Spokesman Cesar Torrico said that the plane underwent an inspection before departing for Colombia and reported no problems.\nBritish Aerospace, which is now known as BAE Systems, says that the first 146-model plane took off in 1981 and that just under 400 were built in total in the U.K. through 2003. It says around 220 of are still in service in a variety of roles, including aerial firefighting and overnight freight services.\nA video published on the team's Facebook page showed the team readying for a flight earlier Monday in Sao Paulo's Guarulhos international airport. Photos of team members in the cockpit and posing in front of the plane ahead of departure quickly spread across social media.\nThe team, from the small city of Chapeco, was in the middle of a fairy tale season. It joined Brazil's first division in 2014 for the first time since the 1970s and made it last week to the Copa Sudamericana finals -- the equivalent of the UEFA Europa League tournament -- after defeating two of Argentina's fiercest squads, San Lorenzo and Independiente, as well as Colombia's Junior.\n\"This morning I said goodbye to them and they told me they were going after the dream, turning that dream into reality,\" Chapecoense board member told TV Globo. \"The dream was over early this morning.\"\nThe team is so modest that tournament organizers ruled that its 22,000-seat arena was too small to host the final match, which was moved to a stadium 300 miles (480 kilometres) to the north in the city of Curitiba.\n\"This is unbelievable, I am walking on the grass of the stadium and I feel like I am floating,\" Andrei Copetti told the AP. \"No one understands how a story that was so amazing could suffer such a devastating reversal. For many people here reality has still not struck.\"\nA família de futebol brasileiro está de luto. Isso é uma tragédia. Mando minhas condolências às famílias dos falecidos.

[Photo/Agencies] \nGENEVA - It is estimated that more than 20,000 people have been forced to leave their homes in Aleppo over the past 72 hours, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Tuesday. \nIt added that around 60,000 people fled the war-torn area since August of this year. \nIn a media statement issued Tuesday night, ICRC said that some people live in shelters, some in mosques, schools, or tents, while others found refuge in unfinished or damaged buildings or being hosted by families who are already under great strain. \n\"So many people have been forced to flee two or three times as the bullets and bombs got closer,\" the statement said, adding that the west of Aleppo has seen more than 40,000 people flee areas of active fightings. \nIn the east, intensified attacks on the neighborhoods of Masakan Hananoo, Jabal Jabro and Sakhour reportedly led 20,000 people to flee in different directions in search of a safe place. \n\"The majority of those who flee are families, including many with infants and young children, and the situation in their precarious shelters is made worse for all as winter takes hold and temperatures drop,\" ICRC stressed. \nAleppo used to be a city of over two million but with so much fighting and displacement, it is impossible to say with any precision how many people are left today, it added. \nIn a statement made available earlier Tuesday morning, the UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Stephen O'Brien, warned that food stocks have all but run out in eastern districts of the northern city. \nThis has been compounded by the lack of adequate medical facilities and supplies, as well as a recent upsurge in fighting around Allepo.

But don’t call it an official delegation, the White House insisted. “I can tell you that the president has decided not to send a presidential delegation to attend the memorial service today,” Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. “I can tell you, however, that Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes will attend the service, as will the top U.S. diplomat in Cuba, Jeff DeLaurentis.”\nRhodes was one of the key architects of the secret diplomacy with Cuba that led to the stunning December 2014 announcement that the two Cold War adversaries would renew diplomatic relations and pursue deeper economic ties. Obama nominated DeLaurentis, the top U.S. official at the embassy in Havana, to be ambassador, but Republicans have blocked the nomination.\nAlthough Rhodes and DeLaurentis “will be representing the United States at the memorial service this evening,” Earnest said, Obama has withheld the official “delegation” designation in a symbolic show of disapproval toward the government in Havana.\n”There are many aspects of the U.S.-Cuba relationship that were characterized by a lot of conflict and turmoil, not just during the Castro regime, but we continue to have some significant concerns about the way the Cuban government currently operates, particularly with regard to protecting the basic human rights of the Cuban people,” the spokesman said.\n“This is an appropriate way to show respect, to participate in the events that are planned for this evening, while also acknowledging some of the differences that remain between our two countries,” Earnest said.",

Watch This \nMORE: Johnny Manziel is truly troubled \nIn the documents, made public on the Texas Our Texas Facebook page , accuser Eric Newton said he was working a private party attended by Manziel early Sept. 6. The suit says Manziel \"demanded\" Newton, a bar back, to make drinks for him and several other people. Newton told Manziel he was not permitted to fill alcohol orders and instructed him to visit an operational bar downstairs. \nLater, after a friend told Manziel he overheard Newton talking about him to another customer, Manziel \"came downstairs, ran behind the bar, cursed at Mr. Newton, and punched him in the face, breaking Mr. Newton's nose,\" the lawsuit says. \nMORE: Manziel's dramatics \nNewton seeks damages of $200,000 to $1 million. \nManziel, 23, is set to appear in a Dallas courtroom Thursday to settle a domestic assault case involving his former girlfriend. Earlier this month, prosecutors agreed to a conditional dismissal of a a misdemeanor assault charge against Manziel, who was accused of hitting and threatening ex-girlfriend Colleen Crowley in January. \nManziel's attorney did not respond to requests for comment Monday. \nThe former Browns quarterback, who won the Heisman in 2012 while at Texas A&M, is also believed to be facing three other lawsuits related to property damage on separate occasions in the Los Angeles area over the spring and summer. \nManziel has denied wrongdoing in those incidents.",

    "text": "MUMBAI: Nearly a million exasperated bankers, who are abused and sometimes even locked up inside their branches for apparently no fault of theirs, are now protesting against the Reserve Bank of India , demanding transparency from the central bank on its handling of the demonetisation issue. \n\nThe regulator must do its bit to explain the measures taken to handle the situation rather than issue circulars and tweak rules by the hour, said the biggest bank staff union in a letter to RBI governor Urjit Patel . \n\n\"We are writing a letter to RBI governor so that they come clean on the issue as there’s no transparency on the part of the regulator,\" said CH Venkatachalam, general secretary, All India Banks Employee Association . \n\n\"They are saying currency is coming, but we have no idea when. RBI should disclose how much currency has been printed and how much they have distributed to the banks so that people can be properly informed.\" \n\nThe bank employees’ association also wrote to the Indian Banks Association against the multiple circulars issued by the central bank and how they were creating problems for bank employees. \n\n\"RBI is issuing umpteen number of instructions every day and the branch staff can’t cope with such orders —sometimes they create more problems than offer solutions,\" the letter addressed to IBA chief Rajeev Rishi said. The association has also told IBA that bank employees have been under severe pressure due to tensions, conflicts and clashes breaking out inside bank branches. \n\n\"We seek the IBA’s intervention to ask for proper police protectionin branches,\" the letter said. \n\n\"We have reports that irritated customers are creating a ruckus inside branches and sometimes even locking the branches and staff had to seek the help of police for their release.\" \n\n\n\nThe next 10 days are likely to be crucial as a huge number of employees and pensioners would throng the bank branches to draw their salary but nonavailability of cash may lead to a lot of heartburn. \n\n\"We find branches displaying boards like ‘No Cash’, ATM Out Of Cash’, etc, which seriously erode the reputation of our banks in the eye of the common people,\" the letter said, adding \"majority of the ATMs are still non-functional and this would add to the crowd and congestion inside branch premises.\" \n\nThe association also pointed out that due to non-availability of cash, bank branches are finding it difficult to deal with angry customers. \"We have got reports about customers abusing the staff since they can’t give them the required cash due to reasons beyond their control,\" the letter said. \n\n\"There are reports that customers are asked to withdraw Rs 2,000 or Rs 4,000 instead of the weekly Rs 24,000 which they are eligible to, since there is inadequate cash balance in the branches.\"  ",

    "text": "Cosmopolitan When you think of doggy style, you probably think of kneeling on all fours while your partner grabs your hips and enters you from behind ... but this isn't the only option. This position is easy to modify, which is good news for those of us for whom it doesn't work perfectly every time. Ahead, six common doggy-style struggles and what to do about them.\n1. The penetration feels too deep. Doggy style often allows for deeper penetration than other positions, one of the reasons so many dudes love it (to say nothing of the view). Deep penetration can be painful, though, especially if you're not fully turned on: Not only do you get wet during arousal, your vagina also expands and elongates , so don't skimp on foreplay before doggy-style sex. Aim for a 20-minute warm-up ( one study found that women reported this to be their ideal amount of foreplay), and don't forget the lube. If your partner is still slamming into your cervix, have them take shallower thrusts, yes, but also remember that you can control the motion too. Experiment with having your partner stay still while you move side to side, up and down, back and forth, or in circles. Bringing your knees closer together will bring your butt cheeks closer together too, forming more of a cushion between your vagina and the penis or dildo. You can also arch your back more deeply so the penis or dildo is redirected to the sensitive front wall of your vagina.\n2. The penetration doesn't feel deep enough. If the giver isn't getting deep enough for you, an accessory can help. Try Sportsheets' I Like It Doggie Style Strap , which comes in both standard and \"plus-size\" versions and will make you wonder how you ever did doggy without it. When the giver grabs onto straps rather than hips, they have greater leverage and ability to adjust the angle of the receiver's pelvis, meaning deeper penetration and less strain on the receiver's back. You can also try variations on the classic kneeling-on-all-fours position: When you're standing with your feet spread apart, for example, your partner can spread your butt cheeks further apart for better access.\nSportsheets 3. You're uncomfortable without belly support. Some people report that they don't like their bellies hanging unsupported during doggy style. If you're one of them, check out the Liberator Wedge , which is essentially a triangle-shaped pillow you can lie across during rear-entry sex (and so much more). If you don't want to invest in sex-specific bed trimmings, stacking literally any old pillows underneath you will work as well, or lie over the edge of a bed, table, chair, or couch.\nLiberator 4. Your vagina isn't lining up with the penis or dildo. While a height difference outside of the bedroom ain't no thing , during doggy style, you want your parts to align with your partner's. Again, a doggy-style strap can help tilt the receiver's pelvis to a more convenient angle, as can the Liberator Wedge: Kneeling on the wedge with your knees on the lower side will both raise your pelvis higher than it would otherwise be and angle it upward. You can also try kneeling on the bed while your partner stands on the floor next to it, or lying stomach-down on the edge of the bed with your knees on the floor while your partner kneels behind you. Another technique to try: Lie down on your belly and have your partner enter you, then slowly raise yourselves up gradually. This may take some practice and possibly a collapse or two, but it's a good way to find your doggy-style sweet spots.\n5. Doggy style feels impersonal. While I think that much of the allure of doggy style lies in how primal it seems, maybe your beef with it is that it doesn't feel sensual enough. But there's no rule that doggy style has to be fast, hard, or rough. If you like, forego the dirty talk in favor of affectionate words and have your partner skip the ass-slapping and hair-pulling to stroke your breasts, back, hair, butt, thighs, neck, and clit. Slow the pace, and voilà, you've done it: You've made doggy style romantic. Eye contact still isn't part of the equation (unless you're doing it in front of a mirror, which I highly recommend), but the trust implied when you aren't looking into someone's eyes during sex can be hot in its own right.\n6. You're not getting enough stimulation. Doggy style can be light on the clitoral stimulation, so it's up to your and your partner's fingers, plus any toys you want to introduce, to take care of that gap. Your partner can use a longer, curved vibrator like Jimmyjane's FORM 6 to reach your clit and shouldn't neglect other erogenous zones , such as the underside of your butt, the back of your neck, and your anus. In fact, anal play can be the key to mind-blowing doggy-style sex, whether that means your partner's finger is inside or around your anus or you're rocking a butt plug or dildo in there. For sensory overload of the very best kind, try doggy style sex with a butt plug inside and fingers or a vibrator on your clit.\nFollow Hayley on Twitter .\n Share Tweet Email",

It was always going to be epic and a glimpse of what went down on this next episode of Karan Johar's talk show Koffee With Karan is proof. The promos of Koffee With Karan Season 5 Episode 4 are testament to the fact that a lot of unexpected-but-yay-we-love-it revelations and antics are going to take place. We can't wait, nor can the rest of the Internet. Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh have, of course, been trending since last week when it was revealed that the two actors would be fellow guests on Koffee . Now, actress Katrina Kaif, who reportedly dated Ranbir until the middle of this year , is also trending. It doesn't take a lot for the uninhibited Ranveer Singh to be the most entertaining version of himself and since Ranbir Kapoor has experience being both Besharam and Badtameez , but we're going to give Karan Johar some credit here - the Chikni Chameli dance-off he challenged both actors to was, after all, his idea. Chikni Chameli , for those of you who may not know, is a song starring Katrina Kaif from the Karan Johar-produced film Agneepath . Inspired. Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh dance to Katrina Kaif's song on Koffee As expected, the dance-off is pure gold. We'll leave you to decide who won but we will say this - Ranbir was confident but Ranveer's energy was electric. Had the camera been on Karan, you would have seen him rolling on the floor laughing. We're hoping to see some outtakes from the show soon. Ranbir: My conscience is very clear because I have never used it. Ranveer , when asked about being turned on while filming intimate scenes: 210 % Luckily for us, we don't have to wait till Sunday night to watch Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh dancing Katrina-style. Footage has already been posted on social media because it's just too precious to be kept under wraps. Behold the glory of the Chikni Chameli dance-off: The dynamic duo on #KoffeeWithKaran ! With #RanbirKapoor & @RanveerOfficial in the house, it's going to be an explosive episode. pic.twitter.com/dZwmqTd674 Earlier in July, Ranbir and Ranveer were also spotted dancing to Dilli Wali Girlfriend at a party hosted by Karan himself.",

    "text": "Philippine Daily Inquirer / 03:12   Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte attends a meeting between business leaders and heads of states of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, during their annual forum in Lima, Peru, Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016. (AP Photo/Martin Mejia) \nPresident Duterte said he found his first Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Leaders’ Summit to be “a productive one” and “very informative.” He was seen studying the briefing papers intently, and indeed he himself said he did a lot of reading at the annual conference, held this year in Lima, the capital of Peru. His choice of the topic which impressed him the most comes as a pleasant surprise to those who heard him say, initially, that he would not honor the Paris Agreement on climate change. Mitigation strategies as a response to global warming, he said, was the issue that struck him the most. \nThis is good news, because the Philippines remains one of the countries most vulnerable to the undeniable effects of climate change: We experience stronger typhoons, for instance, because the Pacific Ocean, where these storms start, has seen a rise in surface temperatures; a warmer ocean breeds more powerful storms. \nThe President noted that “Russia, China and Vietnam were the most eager countries to invite [delegations of observers]. They are ready to share new technologies on mitigation.” ADVERTISEMENT \nMr. Duterte also held bilateral meetings with the two world leaders he seems to hold in the highest regard: China’s Xi Jinping, whom he described as wearing a wide smile during their talk; and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, who he said invited him to visit Moscow and who repeated his invitation at least three times. “You know we have become fast friends,” he said of the two leaders. \nThe meeting with Xi cements the understanding on the mutual use of Panatag Shoal reached during President Duterte’s state visit to Beijing; the one with Russia opens the door for the sale of Philippine agricultural produce. \nBut a summit of leaders like the annual Apec rite is primarily a tightly choreographed exercise in geopolitical theater. Unfortunately for the President, he skipped the traditional gala dinner, where the leaders can do some real networking among themselves, and he skipped the traditional picture-taking session, where the leaders seek to celebrate unity in diversity and also to honor the year’s host. Even though he sent Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay to represent him, the effect of his absence was jarring. (Traditionally, leaders skip parts of an Apec conference when there is a natural calamity or a political crisis back home.) \nEx-president Fidel Ramos, who hosted the Apec summit during his presidency and who called a press conference on Monday to express his disappointment, did not sugarcoat his criticism of President Duterte’s absence at the two Apec events. \n“As a President, it is his duty to be there at all times even though he does not feel well,” he said in a mix of English and Filipino. “So what if the President is not feeling well? If he has a headache, there’s a doctor accompanying the delegation always. There’s also a doctor in Lima.” \nRamos in particular scored Duterte, whom he had encouraged to run for the presidency, for missing the traditional group photo. “That is not enough to prevent you from having even just a group photo with the leaders. Never mind the dinner, just have the soup, but at the group photo, where is the Philippines? Nowhere. As President you should be in the forefront and look as big as these guys. With 101.5 million people, you’ll just hide in the back?” \nThere is a reason why leaders continue to take part in elaborate rituals like the Apec conference; they can meet fellow leaders face to face, take their measure, project their country’s presence onto the world stage. It’s a pity that, aside from Xi and Putin, the champions of the President’s projected new world order, there was no one else he seemed to be interested in. Surely the country’s highest interests require a broader view, a more disciplined approach.",

    "text": "Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has suggested both Victor Moses and Willian's futures lie at Stamford Bridge after transfer speculation emerged around the two leading up to Saturday's London derby against Tottenham Hotspur .  \nAlbert Masnou of Spanish daily  Sport reported Moses will be subject of interest from Barcelona this winter following his rise to form this season, but Conte hinted his desire to keep the Nigerian, per ESPN FC's Liam Twomey:\nConte doesn't want to indulge Moses to Barca reports, says he wants his players to be focused on keeping up their good form #cfc \n— Liam Twomey (@liam_twomey) November 25, 2016 Moses' revival combined with Pedro's fine form has also led to rumours that former Blues chief Jose Mourinho, now at Manchester United , could attempt to form a reunion with Willian, per the  Daily Star 's  David Woods . \nHowever, Conte suggested there is a future for the Brazilian at Stamford Bridge as he looks to have an impact in Saturday's fixture, touching on Willian's recent absence following the death of his mother:\nConte on Willian: \"He has come back. Now it's important to find good form because in this period he was unlucky. You know why\" #cfc \n— Liam Twomey (@liam_twomey) November 25, 2016 Goal's Chelsea correspondent, Nizaar Kinsella, provided further quotes from the Blues boss, who elaborated on Willian's value to the club:\nAntonio Conte: \"Willy is an important player for us. I count a lot on him\" #CFC #Chelsea \n— Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) November 25, 2016 Conte also confirmed club captain John Terry will be out of action for two to three weeks and therefore will not be in line to feature against manager Mauricio Pochettino's men on Saturday.\nESPN FC's Twomey  provided quotes from Friday's press conference, where Conte said Terry will be missing for Saturday's evening fixture with a muscular injury, while Mikel John Obi is also on the absentees list:\nConte on injuries: \"For tomorrow Terry & Mikel aren't available. John has a muscular problem & Obi will train with us in next week\" #cfc \n— Liam Twomey (@liam_twomey) November 25, 2016 Saturday's clash will see Tottenham and Chelsea collide after last season's feisty Battle at the Bridge, where the two teams drew 2-2, effectively ending Spurs' title run.\nConte said passion will be required this weekend, although it will need to be controlled, per the Press Association's Matt McGeehan:\nConte on Chelsea-Spurs storm: \"It's right to put your passion, but in the right way, not in a bad way.\"\n— Matt McGeehan (@mattmcgeehan) November 25, 2016 Conte also gave his views on Thursday's announcement that former Liverpool superstar Steven Gerrard was retiring from his playing career, per BBC Sport .\nDespite never coming into contact with the Merseysider in the Premier League, Conte holds a \"great respect\" for Gerrard, saying:\nConte on Gerrard: \"He was a fantastic player, a legend for Liverpool & for the national team. I have great respect for him\" #cfc #lfc \n— Liam Twomey (@liam_twomey) November 25, 2016 The Blues currently lead the Premier League by a single point, but a London-derby victory could see Conte's men pull clear of Liverpool and Manchester City , who face Sunderland and Burnley on Saturday, respectively.\nThe west Londoners hold an advantage in that they don't have any UEFA Champions League commitments, while Spurs lost 2-1 at AS Monaco on Tuesday, although Conte would rather be busier, given the choice:\nAntonio Conte: \"It can be an advantage to have more days to work, but I prefer to be in the Champions League.\" #CFC #Chelsea \n— Nizaar Kinsella (@NizaarKinsella) November 25, 2016 Four points separate these two teams coming into Saturday's heated encounter, and Tottenham travel to Stamford Bridge with memories of their most recent, disappointing collision still fresh in their minds.\nA win in west London could pull Pochettino's men within a single point of the Premier League leaders, but with six wins and no goals conceded in their last six, Conte's side look to be in unstoppable form.",

    "text": "For the second year in a row, protesters rallied along Chicago's Magnificent Mile urging a Black Friday boycott to raise awareness of police misconduct toward minorities and other inequalities in the city's poorest neighborhoods.\nAt 10 a.m., about 150 protesters gathered near Water Tower Place on North Michigan Avenue.\nAs demonstrators were scheduled to begin the day's protests, uniformed Chicago police officers convened in front of a handful of Michigan Avenue stores.\nTraffic was moving normally, leaving shoppers and tourists to amble freely along the street while helicopters whirred overhead. The lack of action allowed some officers to shake hands with passers-by in one case, or point a group of lost tourists toward Grand Lux Cafe.\nKirby Shaw, 23, handed out posters early Friday outside the old Chicago Water Tower, urging a civilian police oversight council.\nThe Los Angeles cook, in Chicago visiting his sister, said he was walking down the Magnificent Mile and decided to get involved after coming upon the gathering protesters. He said police misconduct, and Donald Trump 's presidential election victory, were motivators.\n\"I figured if I'm going to be writing about it on social media I should actually get involved,\" Shaw said. \"A lot of the same things that are going on here also are happening in LA, but you don't hear about it as much.\"\nVideo: Tiffeny Boxley, mom of Mount Greenwood police shooting victim, Joshua Beal For the second year in a row, protesters rallied along Chicago's Magnificent Mile urging a Black Friday boycott to raise awareness of police misconduct toward minorities and other inequalities in the city's poorest neighborhoods.\nFor the second year in a row, protesters rallied along Chicago's Magnificent Mile urging a Black Friday boycott to raise awareness of police misconduct toward minorities and other inequalities in the city's poorest neighborhoods.\nSee more videos The protest was planned by a network of groups that includes the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression and Black Lives Matter. Organizers said they wanted to draw attention to a range of issues, including police mistreatment of minorities and economic inequalities that keep the city's West and South sides plagued with gun violence and poverty.\nActivists also are denouncing Mayor Rahm Emanuel's new police oversight agency, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which they argue falls short of their call for the true independence of civilian-led oversight in cases of alleged police misconduct.\nLyons resident Barbara Lyons, 79, of Jewish Voice for Peace, said a mix of community groups is taking part in the protest, all with a similar message of inclusion.\n\"For some, it's about the police; some it's about immigration. It's just all the people who are not (Trump supporters), and they're afraid,\" said the longtime activist.\n\"It just upsets me what kind of world my grandchildren will grow up in.\"\nBlack Friday Protest Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune As activist Eric Russell speaks, protesters rally and call for a Black Friday boycott along the Magnificent Mile on Nov. 25, 2016.\nAs activist Eric Russell speaks, protesters rally and call for a Black Friday boycott along the Magnificent Mile on Nov. 25, 2016.\n(Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) As a shopper himself, Shaw said he understands some will not be happy with their message to boycott Black Friday, but \"for one day of the year you cannot buy things and support your local retailers and help make a difference.\"\nLast year, an estimated crowd of 1,000 activists temporarily blocked traffic and access to about a dozen ritzy Michigan Avenue retailers to protest the recorded fatal shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald by a white Chicago police officer. The demonstration came days after release of disturbing dashcam footage of the October 2014 encounter, in which the teen is shot 16 times as he appears — with knife in hand — to be walking away from police.\nFour people were arrested during that demonstration, also held the day after Thanksgiving.\ncgutowski@chicagotribune.com \njjperez@chicagotribune.com \nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Donald Trump",

    "text": "IsabelSong \nI still remember the night when I realized that my brother was not just my little brother, but a person of his own — someone with complex thoughts that went past those necessary to beat the next level of the video games he loved. I was 17 and he was 13, and somehow I was sitting on the floor of his room at three in the morning, tossing a ball back and forth with him. \nHe told me that he was worried about one of his friends and how controlling the friend’s girlfriend was. He told me that he was worried about another friend who was starting to fall in with the wrong crowd. He told me how the dynamics in his group of friends were already changing in seventh grade, how people weren’t talking to each other the same way they once did. He told me about drugs and how he didn’t get why people did them, but that he knew people who were doing them. He told me about the “weird” kids in his school. \nI told him about my own days in middle school and how it had temporarily turned me into someone that I’m not, how I regret a lot of the things I did back then. I told him about how the line between teasing and bullying gets blurry really fast, even for someone who still struggles to deal with and understand past experiences of being bullied. I told him about how easy it is to pick on the “weird” kids because everyone else does it, too. \nHe thought about that for a moment, bouncing the ball back to me. And then he said that he hadn’t done that, but that he understood that, too. \nHe told me about things I never knew he even knew about, shared thoughts that I didn’t know could be so complex, and spoke about worries I didn’t know he had. I remember being amazed that this middle school kid, whom I had known his entire life, who was four years younger than me, could be so insightful without meaning to be. \nI used to write my brother off really easily. To me, he was just the younger sibling who went to school, played video games, texted his friends, ate, and slept. He didn’t do as well in school as I did, which I knew frustrated our mom all the time (and still does today). \nBut I’ve paid more attention to my brother since that night we shared three years ago, even if he doesn’t realize it. I’ve learned so much from him. I’ve learned that he approaches life differently than I do. His approach is not better or worse — just different. He prioritizes his friendships, whereas I prioritize school. When I switched schools in high school, I failed to keep in touch with my old friends and didn’t want to make new ones. I even told my parents, “I’ll be out in three years, anyway, so why does it matter?” When my brother was uprooted and moved across state lines from Colorado to California last year, and went to three different high schools in the first semester of his freshman year, he struggled, but still managed to message and FaceTime with his friends every day, just like he always had. He even insisted on going back to Colorado to visit them. He made friends with kids at the school he attended in California for just a few weeks and still keeps up with them today. My brother isn’t the type to write people off easily — like I used to do with him. \nHe doesn’t spend hours studying and doing homework like I did in high school. He doesn’t get involved in a million extracurricular activities like I did in a wild attempt to be part of nearly every organization and honor society. But he sends me cheesy Hamilton jokes on Instagram at four in the morning and tells me about a great John Oliver segment he watched recently. He spends hours handcrafting a wand to go with his Harry Potter costume for Halloween. He talks with the old lady who lives upstairs and eats the meals she cooks for him. He finds joy in the $1 food deals at the gas station on his way home from school, and tells me about the couple of bucks he gives to the homeless father with a baby girl on the street. \nHe rolls his eyes at me for the things and people I fall in love with, but I know he’s listening and noticing the things I care about. I’ve trained Taylor Swift lyrics into his mind since he was little, and he’s followed me into Harry Potter , Percy Jackson , Ed Sheeran, and Hamilton — half because he likes them and half because I’ve talked about them or played the music so much that he has no other choice. I know he’s listening when I talk about the more serious stuff, like Brock Turner and the importance of consensual sex, or why it’s so important to be an educated voter. \nI know he's listening to the rest of the world, too. I know he's listening to marginalized voices by the way he spent the day after the election baking my chocolate chip cookie recipe for a bake sale to raise money for local refugees. I saw it in the pictures he sent me of his carefully wrapped cookies and heard it in his voice, brimming with pride, when he told me his cookies had sold out. I didn't even know that that was something he was involved with until he asked me what to do about the chocolate chips that melted together in the L.A. heat. And I know he's listening to the good in the world when he tells me that despite the years of progress we may lose, “we can get it back.” \nHe listens in a way that I’ve never quite learned. He’s quiet, whereas I’m loud — probably a result of growing up with an older sister who never shuts up. He takes his time, whereas I am ambitious and feel like I have a clock ticking loudly in my head as the seconds of my life are lost forever. He’s giving, whereas I am selfish, and he takes more time to get really, truly angry, whereas I go off on raging rants on a daily basis. It doesn’t mean he cares any less, though, as I learned that night with the bouncy ball. It just means that he internalizes more. \nI don’t call him enough to say hi because, as usual, I’m too wrapped up in my own life. But that doesn’t mean that I’m not thinking about him. And, being my brother, he lets me know that he’s thinking about me by sending me weird videos of Mom on Snapchat and texting me the names of singers he thinks I’ll like. \nHe’s teaching me the value of listening and of prioritizing people and relationships. He’s teaching me the value of having a smaller group of people and things to care about, teaching me that I don’t have to be doing everything. He’s teaching me how I can let people know I’m thinking about them with just a simple text or YouTube video. He’s teaching me the value of moving more slowly, of not racing to check the next box on my list. And sometimes it frustrates me, how different he is from me, how slowly he moves through life, or how little ambition I think he shows. \nBut he’s also teaching me that different isn’t bad or worse. It’s just different. \nWant to be an MTV Founders contributor? Send your full name, age, and pitches to mtvfounders@gmail.com.",

What was contentious in the accord? Who is Juan Manuel Santos? Government opponents led by former President Alvaro Uribe said the deal was too favourable to the rebels.\nFarc and government negotiators worked round the clock to make more than 50 changes to make it more acceptable to conservative Colombians who despise the Farc.\nMr Uribe and other sceptics continued to claim the changes made were cosmetic.\nAnalysis: Wyre Davies, South America Correspondent The civil war between left wing Farc guerrillas and the Colombian government lasted for more than 50 years and claimed the lives of at least 200,000 people.\nSo, many people were taken aback when Colombian voters last month narrowly rejected a peace plan drawn up between the two sides after four years of talks in Havana.\nThousands of supporters marched in support of the deal after the divisive vote A formal ceasefire still holds, but there are worries there could be a return of nationwide violence and that a chance for peace could be lost for another generation.\nNot holding another referendum will anger those on the right who say the new plan is too similar to the original version, but President Santos is hoping the nationwide desire for peace will override those objections.\nPresident Santos has made clear there is no more room for negotiation despite Mr Uribe requesting a meeting with the Farc leadership to discuss his concerns.\n\"This new accord possibly won't satisfy everybody, but that's what happens in peace accords. There are always critical voices; it is understandable and respectable,\" Mr Santos said.\nHe has said ratification would take place in Congress where the government coalition has a solid majority.\nMr Uribe had been pushing for another referendum which he said would vote down the accord again.\nMr Uribe's party opposes the deal on the grounds that it was too lenient on crimes committed during the conflict Mr Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October for his efforts in bringing an end to the conflict, prompting speculation that the deal could still be saved .\nGovernment negotiators say the peace accord needs to be signed urgently for fear that a delicate ceasefire could unravel unless implementation begins soon.\nLast week two suspected Farc fighters were killed during fighting with security forces who said they mistook them for members of Colombia's second-largest rebel group, the ELN.\nFarc rebels have also expressed anger over the killings of several land reform activists and human rights defenders.",

    "text": "NEWS Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen's 9-Year Term Officially Ends At Nalanda University Following Differences With Govt In February last year, Sen, in a letter to the Governing Board had said he will not seek a second term as Chancellor as the BJP government did not want him to continue. 23/11/2016 8:31 PM IST | Updated 37 minutes ago   B Mathur / Reuters India's Nobel economics laureate Amartya Sen ADVERTISEMENT \nNobel-Laureate economist Amartya Sen's nearly a decade-long association with Nalanda University has come to an end with the government reconstituting the governing body of the prestigious institute. \nSen, a critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was chancellor of the university and his term had come to an end in July last year but he had continued his association as a member of its Governing Board. \nSources said President Pranab Mukherjee, in his capacity as the Visitor of the university, approved the reconstitution of the Governing Board in accordance with provision of the Nalanda University Act, 2010. \nThe President also approved giving temporary charge of Vice Chancellor to senior-most Dean of the University as the current VC Gopa Sabharwal's one year extension expires tomorrow. It will be a stop-gap measure until the new Vice Chancellor is appointed. \nNiti Ayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya, President of Indian Council for Cultural Relations Lokesh Chandra, and Professor Arvind Sharma, Faculty of Religious Studies, McGill University in Canada have been appointed as members of the GB under the category of renowned academicians. \nIn February last year, Sen, in a letter to the Governing Board had said he will not seek a second term as Chancellor as the BJP government did not want him to continue. \nTrinamool Congress MP Sugata Bose and UK-based columnist Lord Meghnad Desai, who were also member of the GB, were not included in the newly-constituted board. \nThe new governing board will be a 14-member body which will be chaired by the chancellor. It will also comprise vice-chancellor, along with five members nominated by India, China, Australia, Laos PDR and Thailand. \nEconomist and former revenue secretary N K Singh, who was also member of the Nalanda Mentors Group, will represent India. \nThe other members of the board will be Secretary (East) in the Ministry of External Affairs, an Additional Secretary rank official of Ministry of HRD and two members representing the Bihar state government. \nWhile Sen could not be contacted for reaction, Bose, a former Harvard professor, said it was government's prerogative to reconstitute the board. But at the same time he said, \"There was a need to ponder whether this is the way we maintain national prestige.\" \nReacting to government's decision, Singh said this is for the first time the governing board has been reconstituted in accordance with provision of the Nalanda University Act, 2010, adding it should have been done much earlier. \nThe idea to revive Nalanda University was first mooted in 2005 by the then President APJ Abdul Kalam. The university is being built near the ruins of the historic academic place by the same name in Bihar and Sen was involved with the project since 2007. A number of countries are involved in the project. \nIndian government had enacted the Nalanda University Act, 2010 to implement the decisions arrived at the Second East Asia Summit held in January, 2007 in the Philippines and subsequently at the Fourth East Asia Summit in Thailand for establishment of the Nalanda University. \nIn 2007, the Nalanda Mentor Group (NMG) was formed to implement the project. The NMG was discharging the functions of the Governing Board.",

    "text": "Tweet 0 Obasanjo Former President Olusegun Obasanjo received a dose of his own pill yesterday when the House of Representatives lambasted him in response to his description of lawmakers as corrupt. The lawmakers described him as the “grandfather of corruption”, who is “acting as lifetime opposition leader, blackmailer” that “wants to bring down Buhari’s government”. Delivering the First Akintola Williams Annual Lecture in Lagos on Wednesday, Obasanjo, among other things said the “National Assembly stinks and stinks to high heavens. It needs to be purged.” He added that the office of the lawmakers is “a den of unarmed robbers”. House spokesman Abdulrazak Namdas, at a news conference accused Obasanjo of introducing corruption to the National Assembly on its first day in office in 1999. But the Senate kept mum after a lengthy executive session yesterday. The upper chamber did not respond to the ex-President’s accusations. Namdas said: “Our attention has been drawn to a statement credited to former President Olusegun Obasanjo at a lecture he delivered recently, wherein, in his characteristic manner, accused everybody but himself of corruption. ”He ventured to accuse the National Assembly of budget padding, accused the House of criminal activities of threatening the life of a ‘whistleblower’, lampooned constituency projects which he approved as President, ventured to discuss the budget of National Assembly which is highly underfunded” Namdas said the House would ordinarily not join issues with the former President but “because of the material misstatement of facts, outright lies and falsehoods, and mischievous innuendo introduced in his statement, we are left with no option but to correct him. ”We have repeatedly maintained that there was no “padding” of the 2016 Appropriation Act, which is a legitimate document passed by the National Assembly, authenticated by the Clerk to the National Assembly as provided in the Acts Authentication Act and assented to by Mr. President. It is most unfortunate that a former President of Chief Obasanjo’s stature would allow himself to be hoodwinked and procured by a renegade member of the House, who embarked on massive propaganda and lies just because he was removed from office. ”He claimed that the National Assembly Budget is very high, when by all standards, the National Assembly is grossly underfunded and is hampered from effectively and legitimately carrying out its Constitutionally assigned functions. The National Assembly Budget funds a bureaucracy of about 5,000 civil servants. It has some other agencies under its preview such as the National Assembly Service Commission with its own staff of about 500, even the Public Complaints Commission is now a parastatal of the National Assembly. “National Assembly Budget also funds the National Institute for Legislative Studies, which is a legislative think-tank and highly rated academic institution that serves both National and State Houses of Assembly and even international legislators. All these agencies also have their capital budget including development of their headquarters, procurement of office equipment, procurement of regular items for running their offices; the National Assembly maintain legislative aides of about 3,000 in number, that aid the work of the Assembly; it also conducts regular public hearings involving the media and stakeholders and oversight activities, involving huge sums of money. ”It is also unbecoming of a former President to quote figures of sums of money that are factually incorrect. No member of the House of Representatives receives N10m every month. The salaries and allowances of members of the House are as determined by the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC). Of course further sums of money are spent as running costs, that is, the cost of running the office of a member. “If a Minister, Chief Executive or Director in a Ministry travels on official duties, for instance, do you include the cost of his ticket and accommodation as part of his salary or allowances? Does the cost of stationeries and maintenance of equipment like computers used in their offices, form part of their salaries and allowances? “These are some of the costs that must be taken care of by the National Assembly and the media calls these costs “jumbo pay”. For goodness sake, the National Assembly is an arm of government, not just an ordinary agency of government.” The Reps Spokesman said Budget of many agencies in the Executive Branch are indeed higher than the current Budget of the National Assembly that is an arm of government. “Examples abound, CBN, NNPC, NCC etc. Allowances paid to even junior staff of some of these government agencies cannot be compared to what members of National Assembly enjoy. ”Undoubtedly, the former President Obasanjo is understandably angry with the National Assembly as an institution having foiled his ambition for a third-term in office even after trying to corrupt the members with a bribe of at least N50m each. Lest we forget, the person who introduced corruption to the National Assembly is Chief Olusegun Obasanjo. “He birthed the 4th Republic National Assembly with corrupt practices from day one; indeed the first day of the Republic. He bribed both PDP, ANPP and AD legislators on their inauguration in 1999 to vote against the majority candidate of PDP, Dr. Chuba Okadigbo. That was how Senator Evan Enwerem became Senate President. “Have we forgotten the sacks of money displayed on the floor of the House of Representatives being bribe money paid by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo to some Honourable members to impeach Speaker, Rt. Hon. Ghali N’abba? “Have we forgotten that Chief Olusegun Obasanjo used his position as President to extort money from businessmen and contractors with his government to build his presidential library? “The list of his corrupt acts while in office is endless. Unquestionably, he is the greatest corrupt person ever to hold office in Nigeria. He remains the grandfather of corruption in Nigeria and lacks the moral authority to discuss corruption or indeed abuse of office in Nigeria as he remains the most corrupt Nigerian on record. “It is unfortunate that he has started his very familiar method of bringing down governments. He did it to Alhaji Shehu Shagari, he did it to Gen. Buhari, he did same to Gen. Babangida, he attempted to bring down Gen. Abacha before he imprisoned him for treason; he made frantic efforts to derail the government of President Ya’ardua when he couldn’t use him. “He supported President Goodluck Jonathan but when he refused to take dictation, he turned against him. He supported President Buhari, but since he has sensed that Nigeria is having economic difficulties under him, he has pounced to derail his government. ”The way Chief Obasanjo talks gives the impression that he is a lifetime opposition leader who has never held any office. What did he do about the issues he raised in his 8 years as President? ”This is a man with unlimited access to President Buhari. Or is it because he has not appointed all his cronies as requested? We may never know. His stuck in trade is blackmail, subversion and treachery. We wish him well.”",

Refugee Noor Begum seen crying near the dead body of her six-month-old son Jane Alam \nThese photographs were taken today in Chittagong, Bangladesh, showing a family who just arrived in the country after fleeing Myanmar. \nShown above, refugee Noor Begum is pictured finally arriving at a camp in Teknaf, in the southern Cox’s Bazar district. \nHer baby son Jane Alam, aged just six months, was suffering from starvation and pneumonia during the journey. \nSadly, he passed away just minutes after the family arrived at relative safety. \nThe family say they had to hide in the hills for 20 days with barely any food, to avoid the brutality of Myanmar’s army. Jane Alam, aged six months, died minutes after their arrival (Picture: Barcroft) Man washed Jane’s body before his burial (Picture: Barcroft) \nJane was laid to rest at a graveyard on a hillside, after men washed his tiny body. \nThis is just one family’s tragedy. Thousands more are trying to reach safety, many being forcibly turned back when they reach the Bangladesh border, Amnesty International said . \nChampa Patel, the organisation’s South Asia Director, said: ‘Fleeing collective punishment in Myanmar, they are being pushed back by the Bangladeshi authorities. \n‘Trapped between these cruel fates, their desperate need for food, water and medical care is not being addressed.’ \nOne woman, 40, said she had fled after the Myanmar army killed her husband and one of her sons. People pray before burying Jane Alam (Picture: Barcroft) Noor Begum seen crying near the dead body of her six-month-old son (Picture: Barcroft) \n‘We are sleeping outside in the mud,’ she said. ‘My son is two years old and is crying all the time, he is very cold in the mornings. Still, compared to Myanmar, Bangladesh seems like heaven to me.’ \nRepression of the Rohingya has been criticised for years, however the latest wave of violence is in response to an attack on Myanmar army border posts on October 9. \nThe retribution from the army goes well beyond anything proportionate and punishes the whole community, not just those responsible, Amnesty said, \nAt least 30,000 people have been forced to flee their homes, according to UN estimates. \nIt is hard to verify exact reports as journalists are not granted access to the areas affected. Who are the Rohingya? \nThe Rohingya are a stateless Muslim ethnic group described by the United Nations as one of the world’s most persecuted minorities. \nUsing a dialect similar to that spoken in Chittagong in southeast Bangladesh, the Sunni Muslims are loathed by many in majority Buddhist Myanmar who see them as illegal immigrants and call them ‘Bengali’– even though many have lived in Myanmar for generations. \nMost live in impoverished western Rakhine state, but are denied citizenship and smothered by restrictions on movement and work. \nThe UN refugee agency says well over 120,000 have fled Rakhine since religious violence in 2012 — an exodus that continues, despite the perils of the sea journey. \nLast year, thousands were stranded at sea after a well-worn trafficking route through Thailand collapsed after the discovery of scores of shallow graves on the Malaysia border. \nThere are around 300,000 Rohingya living in Bangladesh’s southern coastal district bordering Myanmar, the vast majority of whom have fled Myanmar in recent decades. \nBangladesh recognises only a small portion as refugees and regularly turns back those trying to cross the border.

You may soon get a heck of a deal on a 'new' diesel Porsche Cayenne 0 \nPorsche hasn't been able to sell a single diesel since November 3, 2015. Photo by Porsche \nRight now, Porsche is sitting on approximately 1,500 new Cayenne diesel SUVs that it can't sell. But once it gets its diesel ducks in a row, buyers stand to get a hell of a discount on those cars. \nOnce Porsche solves the issues with its 3.0-liter diesels, it can lift its stop sale and sell those cars. But it won't sell them as new cars -- it will sell them as used cars, Automotive News reports , citing an interview with the CEO of Porsche North America. Selling a car as used instead of new can provide significant discounts to the buyer, although Porsche isn't giving out explicit prices. \nRight now, Porsche and the feds are working to craft a solution for its 3.0-liter diesels . The cars contain unreported software that affect its emissions. It's believed that a software fix is all that's required to bring its newest cars into compliance. If that's the case, a single hour of dealership work is all that stands between these Cayennes and buyers. \nThe diesel Porsche Cayenne starts around $62,000. Its diesel engine is rated at approximately 20 mpg city and 29 mpg highway, according to EPA estimates. With 406 pound-feet of torque on tap, it's packing plenty of forward thrust, despite having one of the slowest acceleration times of any Cayenne. Share your voice",

    "text": "Ten years ago, litigation lawyer Michele Hollins was a \"perpetually happy person,\" with twin daughters and a partnership in her Calgary law firm.\nThen, depression struck.\nFor a while, Hollins was able to hide her illness at work, then go home and \"become a complete automaton,\" she says, unable to eat or even muster the energy to get ready for bed.\nDepression, anxiety cost Canadian economy billions, Conference Board says At its worst, the depression crippled her at work, to the point where Hollins would walk into her office, say hello to her assistant and then \"close the door and lay on the floor and cry for hours.\"\nAt her lowest point, she says she would \"spend most of the day trying to figure out how to collect myself enough to get to my car and get home.\"\nThat raw vulnerability doesn't match the general impression society has of lawyers as tough and ambitious.\nBut research suggests that they are at much higher risk of depression, anxiety and substance abuse issues than people in the broader population — and may even be more susceptible than those in other high-stress professions, such as medicine.\nA U.S. study published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine last February found the rate of problem drinking among lawyers was between two and three times higher than among other highly educated professionals, including physicians. The study was funded by the American Bar Association and the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation.\nThe rate of depression was about three times higher than the general population in the U.S., according to lead researcher Patrick Krill, who will be presenting his research to lawyers and law students in Toronto on Monday at a professional development session hosted by the Law Society of Upper Canada.\n\"Impairment among attorneys truly has a ripple effect that implicates everything from the proper and efficient functioning of the economy and government more broadly, to the individual, civil and property rights of citizens who depend on lawyers in the course of daily life,\" said Krill, a lawyer and counsellor.\n\"The impact on society is enormous, and has not, to date, been properly acknowledged or appreciated.\"\nCanadian parallels Although there is limited research on lawyers and mental health in Canada, Krill believes the American findings are \"almost certainly applicable to Canadian lawyers,\" because \"mental health distress and substance abuse are more directly linked to the profession than they are to a nationality.\"\n'Distressed lawyers have a big impact on society,' says Doron Gold, a former lawyer who is now a social worker helping people in the legal profession deal with mental health issues. (Homewood Health Centre)\nLawyers going through emotional distress are unlikely to ask for help, says Doron Gold, a lawyer-turned-social worker at Homewood Health in Toronto, an agency with mental health and addiction facilities across Canada.\n\"If there's stigma in society generally, the stigma is tenfold in the legal profession,\" he says. \"This is a group of people who aren't supposed to have these vulnerabilities. And they're supposed to be impervious to them.\"\nGold will also be speaking at Monday's event in an effort to help lawyers acknowledge there's a problem — and that it's OK to deal with it. \n\nPeople drawn to law tend to be thinkers rather than feelers, he says, which doesn't predispose them to coping well with emotional problems.\nOn top of that, he says the profession \"essentially demands [them] to be perfect,\" and they feel enormous pressure to put up a front of confidence and competence for their clients, peers and bosses.\n'Adversarial' jobs Plus the \"adversarial\" nature of court and hearing proceedings means they can't show anything that could be perceived as weakness. \n\"You don't want [opposing counsel] to see any vulnerability in you if you want to get the better of them,\" Gold says.\nWhen faced with personal or professional distress, lawyers judge themselves harshly for even feeling that way, he says. \n\"[They tell themselves,] 'Suck it up, buttercup,'\" says Gold. \"[They say,] 'You're a fixer, you don't get fixed.'\"\nHe says that by not facing the issue, it usually gets worse, ultimately leading to addiction or a breakdown. \nGold says law societies across the country have set up lawyer assistance programs to provide confidential counselling and treatment before their suffering gets worse.\nIt's in society's best interest, Gold says. \n\"Lawyers impact whether people... have their liberty taken away from them in criminal matters. They help to determine in what homes children grow up in family law matters,\" he says. \"Lawyers have a big impact on society and therefore distressed lawyers have a big impact on society.\"\n'Terrible anxiety' Veteran criminal defence lawyer Derek LaCroix knows first hand the importance of getting help — both for his own well-being and that of his clients. \nDerek LaCroix, executive director of the Lawyers Assistance Program of B.C., overcame anxiety and alcohol addiction while he was working as a criminal defence lawyer. (Lawyers Assistance Program of B.C.)\nDecades ago, the B.C. lawyer suffered \"terrible anxiety\" and became addicted to alcohol. He ended up cutting back his workload because he \"didn't want to go to court drunk or hungover.\"\nLike many lawyers, LaCroix couldn't understand why, as a high achiever, he couldn't solve the problem himself. \n\"I'd go, 'I should be able to do this. I should be able to. Why can't I? What's wrong with me?'\" he says. \"As opposed to, 'Hey I've got a problem. I need help.'\"\nThe prospect of having to go on social assistance jolted him into finally getting assistance.\nAlthough LaCroix went back to work and excelled, he eventually decided to use his experience to help other lawyers in similar situations. He's now the executive director of B.C.'s Lawyer Assistance Program. \n\"If I look back and was honest, I mean, I don't know whether my win-losses would have been much different, but the quality of service I gave my clients was different,\" LaCroix says candidly. \n\"How well I treated them, how quickly I got back to them, how much I listened to them, how much I, you know, appropriately comforted them and/or gave them the straight goods in a kind and useful way.\"\nMental illness in the workplace: Ask for help early, lawyers say \n\n\nAt the urging of friends, Michele Hollins got treatment for her depression, and says she has made a full recovery.\nShe feels fortunate that her seniority as a partner in her firm helped protect her job, and recognizes that many lawyers don't have that job security.\nSo when she started a year-long term as president of the Canadian Bar Association in 2014, she made it her mission to speak openly about mental health and make sure programs were in place — like an online service launched in 2015 — so lawyers could feel safe seeking support. \nHollins says it's rare that a week goes by when she doesn't hear from someone in the law profession who is struggling or seeking help for a colleague.\n\"There is a huge... unmet need that people have to talk about their own mental health challenges.\"",

But prior to 1854, people weren’t exactly lining up to use them, no matter how convenient they were—cables snapped frequently enough that the public viewed them as death traps. Then, along came mechanic Elisha Otis and his miracle invention, the safety elevator. Thanks to his clever engineering, the cable could snap and the elevator would still hold. Make: has a great demo of how it worked: \n\nHowever, elevators carried such a stigma that no one was willing to give Otis’s safety elevator a chance. Sales were practically nonexistent. To show the public that his invention worked, Otis orchestrated a stunt that would change the way we build, work, and live. \nIn 1854, he constructed a 50-foot elevator at the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations in New York, getting P.T. Barnum himself to hype up the crowd. Otis made a show of riding the elevator all the way to the top, then severing the cable that tethered the elevator car to the frame. Shocked onlookers prepared for the inventor to plummet to a particularly ugly death—but when the rope snapped, the elevator dropped only a few inches. “All safe,” he assured the crowd. \nJust to get his point across, Otis repeated his demonstration over and over for months, proving to thousands of onlookers that a safe elevator had finally arrived. Today, there are approximately 2.5 million Otis elevators in operation [ PDF ]. \nSo, the next time you step into an elevator, imagine the cable being cleaved in two—and then breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that if that happened you would be fine.

In his WSJ review of the Garth Davis -directed drama, critic Joe Morgenstern erroneously referenced a past film performance of Kal Penn, as opposed to Patel, to flesh out some background in his print and online review. \"Saroo is played dazzlingly by Dev Patel, who gives his richest performance since The Namesake ,\" Morgenstern wrote, referencing the 2006 drama in which Penn played one of the main roles. The mistake soon caught wind on social media, where Penn himself retweeted an account that pointed out the error.\n@JoeMorgenstern Dev Patel wasn't in the Namesake.

    "text": "President-elect Donald Trump spent the Thanksgiving holiday weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida asking private guests who he should nominate for secretary of state, according to a report from the New York Post .\nAccording to the Post, who spoke with a person who attended Trump’s private dinner, when Trump wasn’t sitting with his family, he was mingling with guests and asking their opinion on who should be the next chief U.S. diplomat: Mitt Romney or Rudy Giuliani.\nMore from the Post:\nOne witness told us Trump took a prime table next to the fireplace in the club’s living room, but spent a lot of time greeting members and asking who they think should be his top diplomat.\nThe spy said, “Donald was walking around asking everybody he could about who should be his secretary of state. There was a lot of criticism about Romney, and a lot of people like Rudy. There are also many people advocating for [former US ambassador to the UN] John Bolton.”\nSince Trump was elected nearly three weeks ago, there has been strong buzz over who he should nominate for secretary of state. Giuliani was the first name to be reported under consideration, but over the last week, it appears as though Trump may be favoring Romney for the position.\nThere have even been rumblings that if Romney wants the job, then Trump has asked him to publicly apologize for the things he said about Trump during the Republican primary season.\nStill, Trump’s top surrogates — Kellyanne Conway and Newt Gringrich — have been very vocal about their opposition to Romney becoming the secretary of state. They contend that if Trump were to choose Romney, then it would be a slap in the face to all those who supported Trump during the hotly contested Republican primaries.",

(Photo: United Phoenix Firefighters) \n\"There are exceptional people in the world and then there is Chris Fitzmaurice,\" said P.J. Dean, United Phoenix Firefighters spokesman and friend of the Phoenix fire captain who died in an ATV accident the day after Thanksgiving. \nFitzmaurice was a 20-plus-year veteran of the department who was beloved by his colleagues, according to Dean. He described Fitzmaurice as \"humble yet confident.\" \nHe is survived by his wife and four daughters who range in ages from 6 to high school, according to Dean. United Phoenix Firefighters has set up a GoFundMe page on behalf of the family. As of 5 p.m. Saturday, it had raised nearly $60,000 of it's $75,000 goal. \nDonors shared their sorrow, remembering Fitzmaurice as a great family man to the \"fitzchix,\" a youth sports coach, avid hunter and community role model. He coached his daughters' softball teams as well as little league, took time to teach fire safety at local schools and trained new Phoenix Fire recruits. \n\"Chris personified the mission of the Phoenix Fire Department,\" Dean said, adding that it made him the perfect person for mentoring new recruits and recruiting new members. \nIn 2004, Fitzmaurice made local headlines when he ran a marathon in support of a fellow firefighter whose son was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis. \n\"Sometimes I run and I get tired and Sean comes across my mind,\" Fitzmaurice told The Arizona Republic in 2004. \"Here's this little guy, and who knows if his lungs would ever let him run a mile, let alone any distance. And I feel like such a wimp. Here I am sniveling about being tired.\" \nFitzmaurice's body is still at the morgue in Flagstaff. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday and his body will then be transported back to Phoenix for memorial services. Firefighters with Phoenix have been taking turns staying with Fitzmaurice's body as well as checking in on his family. \n\"We deal with tragedy all day. But when you deal with your own tragedy, it can be hard to wrap your head around,\" Dean said about how the department is coping with the loss of one of it's own. \nAnyone with questions on the fundraiser or who is looking to donate more than $500 should contact the UPFA office at 602-277-1500.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic of Manchester United (L) speaks to Paul Pogba. Source: Getty Images \n“I’m still confident because we create chances. It’ll come. I’m confident in my team. We just have to pay attention to the small details. \n“We conceded a daft goal [against West Ham], against Arsenal it was also the small details. I’m still confident, it’ll come right. We are dropping silly points, but it’ll come right.” \nBut Mata explained in his blog on the club’s website just how upset the players were after the draw with the Hammers. \nMata said: “A few days ago, we beat Feyenoord in a good game. We were playing to stay in the Europa League and the team delivered; we enjoyed ourselves on the pitch and scored several goals. Ibra goal not enough for MNU 0:57 \n“So far in the Premier League, though, we haven’t found that consistency, that winning streak that is so much needed and that we’re working so hard to achieve. \n“When we seem to be close to a victory, it just slips away. I’m talking mainly about the Premier League games at Old Trafford, which is even more upsetting because playing in front of our fans is an extra, and that’s how we feel. \n“We know we must find the target more often to score more goals. I’m having a look at the calendar and I see that we have eight games to play before the end of the year. Manchester United's Spanish midfielder Juan Mata. Source: AFP \n“Having so many games in such a short period is something positive because we are eager to play again. Starting with the EFL Cup, again with West Ham, and then visiting Everton next weekend. Two good games would help us to approach the Christmas season with more optimism.” \nOn Thursday morning United will have the chance to take revenge on the Hammers at Old Trafford when they face off in the EFL Cup quarter-final.

The Red's eliminated Championship side Leeds 2-0 including a club record landmark goal from 17-year-old Ben Woodburn and Jurgen Klopp had a brilliant message for the him as well as assuring the club they know how to nurture the youngster. \nWoodburn's second half strike entered him into the record books as he became Liverpool's youngest ever scorer in the clubs history at 17-years and 45 days, pipping Michael Owen to the record in the process.

I would have scored if I was in that situation!\" \nThe German continued to add; \"Nothing what we say here is important enough to help Ben Woodburn or myself. It's all good.We know how to handle the situation .\" (Woodburn celebrates scoring with his teammates) \n\"I can say whatever I want but if he scores goals it's difficult to stay cool from your side, no problem. But tonight it was very important that we could have him on the bench and bring him in the game because of our situation in the offensive department. So it's very important for us today and he scored a goal, that makes it much more enjoyable .\" \n\"I've said a lot of times we don't make line-ups because we don't respect the tournament. We make changes to win the game. We needed fresh legs today. It was a mixture of youth and experience and it worked well .\" \nThe semi-final draw takes place tonight with Hull City in the pot with Arsenal vs. Southampton & Manchester United vs. West Ham also vying for a place in the semi's, too.

There are different buttons for the pit limiter, DRS, engine mapping settings and more that make the modern F1 steering wheel look more like a gaming controller than what you’d find in your typical street car. \nWhile we all know that F1 steering wheels were simpler back in the 1960s, what’s surprising is just how long the wheels remained that simple, with most of the development and changes not really coming about until the late 1990s. \nSo sit back and enjoy as Donut Media takes you through the evolution of the F1 steering wheel. 0",

Japan's scientists said this was a strong aftershock of the massive 2011 quake.\nThis time, Japan escaped with only a few reports of minor injuries , and tsunami waves of over 1m.",

CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. 11/21/2016 11:59 am ET Jillian Capewell Entertainment News Editor, The Huffington Post \nHave you ever wanted to play a fast-paced game of Pictionary, but don’t have any friends? Yeah, us, too. \nThanks to the team at Google, there’s now Quick, Draw! , an online game where a computer guesses what you’re doodling based on prompts including “motorbike,”“houseplant,”“pizza,”“foot” and more. It’s an addicting time-waster as well as a fun way to participate in AI learning. \nHere’s how it works, according to the website: “You draw, and a neural network tries to guess what you’re drawing. Of course, it doesn’t always work. But the more you play with it, the more it will learn.” The developers in the above video explain that the technology used in the game is similar to that of Google Translate, which can identify handwritten characters. The computer “looks” at a drawing and attempts to identify it by recognizing patterns from previously viewed drawings. Quick Draw \n“You don’t look just at what the person drew, you look at how they actually drew it,” explains Henry Rowley, a machine learning researcher. “Which strokes did they make first, which direction did they draw them in.” \nThe robot revolution is here, it’s artistic, and it needs you to help it understand that a right-angle triangle is still a triangle. (In our experiments, the computer failed to do this.) \nYou can also play to see just how awful you are at depicting a diving board: Quick Draw",

Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports \nUFC's first dual division champion Conor McGregor has relinquished his featherweight title with Jose Aldo replacing the Irishman as the category's undisputed champion, officials said on Saturday. \nThe move was triggered by a sequence of events that followed light-heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier's withdrawal from his scheduled title defense against Anthony Johnson at UFC 206 on Dec. 10 due to injury. \nMcGregor, who knocked out Eddie Alvarez this month to claim the lightweight crown and become the first fighter in the promotion's history to hold two UFC belts simultaneously, had previously said he did not want to give up either title. \nHe won the featherweight crown by defeating Brazilian Aldo in 13 seconds at UFC 194 last December. \nIn order to keep a title bout on the UFC 206 card, officials asked McGregor to relinquish his featherweight title so Max Holloway and Anthony Pettis could fight for the interim UFC featherweight championship. \nThe winner will then face Aldo, who was unbeaten for 10 years and made seven defenses of his UFC featherweight title before his loss to McGregor, in 2017 for the unified belt. \n(Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru) Next In Sports News",

    "text": "Ferrari, Porsche and McLaren are getting there, but new car company NIO just beat them to the punch and announced itself by introducing the EP9—a 1,360 horsepower fully-electric supercar with a top speed of 194 miles per hour. Advertisement \nOkay, so NIO isn’t exactly new. It’s actually Chinese electric startup NextEV’s new brand. The car isn’t exactly new to us either, as we saw it in broad daylight running around the ‘Ring last month. \nBut that doesn’t make the nature of a 194 MPH electric supercar anything less than special! The new company claims the EP9 is good for 1,360 horsepower, with four electric motors accomplishing a combined 4,670 lb-ft of torque from a 777 volt powertrain that manages a claimed range of 265 miles on a charge. \nIf those figures are true, the EP9 is certainly an insane driving experience. There’s no claimed zero to 60 time just yet, though it’s probably insanely quick because the claimed zero to 124 MPH time is just 7.1 seconds. That’s about as quick as my Focus gets to 60 running down a hill. The total weight of the car is 3,825 pounds. Advertisement \nIf we compare the EP9 to the other electric “hypercar” or supercar or whatever out there, the Rimac Concept S (the sportier version of the Concept One), then the new NIO kid on the block has some catching up to do, at least in the top speed department. \nThe Rimac Concept S is just a touch heavier, but claims to have a ridiculous top speed of 227 miles per hour backed by 1,365 horsepower (just 5 more than the EP9) and 1,328 lb-ft of torque. Rimac claims the Concpet S can hit 124 MPH from zero in just 5.6 seconds, or 1.5 seconds quicker than the EP9. The Rimac’s range is significantly shorter, however, with no claimed range for the Concept S but only 205 miles of electric juice for the Concept One. \nOf course, Rimac only built one of each of the Concept One and Concept S. We’ve heard that NextEV’s NIO will be building only six EP9s for China next year, so there’s that. Oh, and NIO claimed it beat the electric vehicle record when we saw it testing around the Nürburgring, setting a time of 7:05.12. Neat. \nThat sounds amazingly terrifying. As the wise and cognizant David Tracy once said, what a world we live in. Recommended Stories",
